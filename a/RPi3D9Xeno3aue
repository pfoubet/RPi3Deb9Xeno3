/*
 *	This file defines the format for a NIS object in RPC language.
 * It is included by the main .x file and the database access protocol
 * file. It is common because both of them need to deal with the same
 * type of object. Generating the actual code though is a bit messy because
 * the nis.x file and the nis_dba.x file will generate xdr routines to
 * encode/decode objects when only one set is needed. Such is life when
 * one is using rpcgen.
 *
 * Note, the protocol doesn't specify any limits on such things as
 * maximum name length, number of attributes, etc. These are enforced
 * by the database backend. When you hit them you will no. Also see
 * the db_getlimits() function for fetching the limit values.

 *
 * YPPROC_DOMAIN (char *) returns (bool_t) TRUE.  Indicates that the

 * support.
 *
 * YPPROC_DOMAIN_NONACK (char *) returns (TRUE) if the NIS server does serve
 * the named domain, otherwise does not return.  Used in the broadcast case.
 *
 * YPPROC_MATCH (struct ypreq_key) returns (struct ypresp_val).  Returns the
 * right-hand value for a passed left-hand key, within a named map and
 * domain.
 *
 * YPPROC_FIRST (struct ypreq_nokey) returns (struct ypresp_key_val).
 * Returns the first key-value pair from a named domain and map.
 *
 * YPPROC_NEXT (struct ypreq_key) returns (struct ypresp_key_val).  Returns
 * the key-value pair following a passed key-value pair within a named
 * domain and map.
 *
 * YPPROC_XFR (struct ypreq_xfr) returns nothing.  Indicates to a server that
 * a map should be updated.
 *
 * YPPROC_CLEAR	takes nothing, returns nothing.  Instructs a NIS server to
 * close the current map, so that old versions of the disk file don't get
 * held open.
