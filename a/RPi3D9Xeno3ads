s returned.
		An existing window always has a width of zero or more.
		Examples: >
  :echo "The current window has " . winwidth(0) . " columns."
  :if winwidth(0) <= 50
  :  exe "normal 50\<C-W>|"
  :endif
<
wordcount()						*wordcount()*
		The result is a dictionary of byte/chars/word statistics for
		the current buffer.  This is the same info as provided by
		|g_CTRL-G|
		The return value includes:
			bytes		Number of bytes in the buffer
			chars		Number of chars in the buffer
			words		Number of words in the buffer
			cursor_bytes    Number of bytes before cursor position
					(not in Visual mode)
			cursor_chars    Number of chars before cursor position
					(not in Visual mode)
			cursor_words    Number of words before cursor position
					(not in Visual mode)
			visual_bytes    Number of bytes visually selected
			                (only in Visual mode)
			visual_chars    Number of chars visually selected
			                (only in Visual mode)
			visual_words    Number of chars visually selected
			                (only in Visual mode)


							*writefile()*
writefile({list}, {fname} [, {flags}])
		Write |List| {list} to file {fname}.  Each list item is
		separated with a NL.  Each list item must be a String or
		Number.
		When {flags} contains "b" then binary mode is used: There will
		not be a NL after the last list item.  An empty item at the
		end does cause the last line in the file to end in a NL.

		When {flags} contains "a" then append mode is used, lines are
		appended to the file: >
			:call writefile(["foo"], "event.log", "a")
			:call writefile(["bar"], "event.log", "a")

		All NL characters are replaced with a NUL character.
		Inserting CR characters needs to be done before passing {list}
		to writefile().
		An existing file is overwritten, if possible.
		When the write fails -1 is returned, otherwise 0.  There is an
		error message if the file can't be created or when writing
		fails.
		Also see |readfile()|.
		To copy a file byte for byte: >
			:let fl = readfile("foo", "b")
			:call writefile(fl, "foocopy", "b")


xor({expr}, {expr})					*xor()*
		Bitwise XOR on the two arguments.  The arguments are converted
		to a number.  A List, Dict or Float argument causes an error.
		Example: >
			:let bits = xor(bits, 0x80)
<


							*feature-list*
There are four types of features:
1.  Features that are only supported when they have been enabled when Vim
    was compiled |+feature-list|.  Example: >
	:if has("cindent")
2.  Features that are only supported when certain conditions have been met.
    Example: >
	:if has("gui_running")
<							*has-patch*
3.  {Nvim} version. The "nvim-1.2.3" feature means that the Nvim version is
    1.2.3 or later. Example: >
	:if has("nvim-1.2.3")
<
4.  Included patches.  The "patch123" feature means that patch 123 has been
    included.  Note that this form does not check the version of Vim, you need
    to inspect |v:version| for that.
    Example (checking version 6.2.148 or later): >
	:if v:version > 602 || v:version == 602 && has("patch148")
<    Note that it's possible for patch 147 to be omitted even though 148 is
    included.

5.  Beyond a certain version or at a certain version and including a specific
    patch.  The "patch-7.4.237" feature means that the Vim version is 7.5 or
    later, or it is version 7.4 and patch 237 was included.
    Note that this only works for patch 7.4.237 and later, before that you
    need to use the example above that checks v:version.  Example: >
	:if has("patch-7.4.248")
<    Note that it's possible for patch 147 to be omitted even though 148 is
    included.

							*string-match*
Matching a pattern in a String

A regexp pattern as explained at |pattern| is normally used to find a match in
the buffer lines.  When a pattern is used to find a match in a String, almost
everything works in the same way.  The difference is that a String is handled
like it is one line.  When it contains a "\n" character, this is not seen as a
line break for the pattern.  It can be matched with a "\n" in the pattern, or
with ".".  Example: >
	:let a = "aaaa\nxxxx"
	:echo matchstr(a, "..\n..")
	aa
	xx
	:echo matchstr(a, "a.x")
	a
	x

Don't forget that "^" will only match at the first character of the String and
"$" at the last character of the string.  They don't match after or before a
"\n".

==============================================================================
5. Defining functions					*user-functions*

New functions can be defined.  These can be called just like builtin
functions.  The function executes a sequence of Ex commands.  Normal mode
commands can be executed with the |:normal| command.

The function name must start with an uppercase letter, to avoid confusion with
builtin functions.  To prevent from using the same name in different scripts
avoid obvious, short names.  A good habit is to start the function name with
the name of the script, e.g., "HTMLcolor()".

It's also possible to use curly braces, see |curly-braces-names|.  And the
|autoload| facility is useful to define a function only when it's called.

							*local-function*
A function local to a script must start with "s:".  A local script function
can only be called from within the script and from functions, user commands
and autocommands defined in the script.  It is also possible to call the
function from a mapping defined in the script, but then |<SID>| must be used
instead of "s:" when the mapping is expanded outside of the script.
There are only script-local functions, no buffer-local or window-local
functions.

					*:fu* *:function* *E128* *E129* *E123*
:fu[nction]		List all functions and their arguments.

:fu[nction] {name}	List function {name}.
			{name} can also be a |Dictionary| entry that is a
			|Funcref|: >
				:function dict.init

:fu[nction] /{pattern}	List functions with a name matching {pattern}.
			Example that lists all functions ending with "File": >
				:function /File$
<
							*:function-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing a function will also display where it was
last defined. Example: >

    :verbose function SetFileTypeSH
	function SetFileTypeSH(name)
	    Last set from /usr/share/vim/vim-7.0/filetype.vim
<
See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

						*E124* *E125* *E853* *E884*
:fu[nction][!] {name}([arguments]) [range] [abort] [dict]
			Define a new function by the name {name}.  The name
			must be made of alphanumeric characters and '_', and
			must start with a capital or "s:" (see above).  Note
			that using "b:" or "g:" is not allowed. (since patch
			7.4.260 E884 is given if the function name has a colon
			in the name, e.g. for "foo:bar()".  Before that patch
			no error was given).

			{name} can also be a |Dictionary| entry that is a
			|Funcref|: >
				:function dict.init(arg)
<			"dict" must be an existing dictionary.	The entry
			"init" is added if it didn't exist yet.  Otherwise [!]
			is required to overwrite an existing function.	The
			result is a |Funcref| to a numbered function.  The
			function can only be used with a |Funcref| and will be
			deleted if there are no more references to it.
								*E127* *E122*
			When a function by this name already exists and [!] is
			not used an error message is given.  When [!] is used,
			an existing function is silently replaced.  Unless it
			is currently being executed, that is an error.

			For the {arguments} see |function-argument|.

					*:func-range* *a:firstline* *a:lastline*
			When the [range] argument is added, the function is
			expected to take care of a range itself.  The range is
			passed as "a:firstline" and "a:lastline".  If [range]
			is excluded, ":{range}call" will call the function for
			each line in the range, with the cursor on the start
			of each line.  See |function-range-example|.
			The cursor is still moved to the first line of the
			range, as is the case with all Ex commands.
								*:func-abort*
			When the [abort] argument is added, the function will
			abort as soon as an error is detected.
								*:func-dict*
			When the [dict] argument is added, the function must
			be invoked through an entry in a |Dictionary|.	The
			local variable "self" will then be set to the
			dictionary.  See |Dictionary-function|.

						*function-search-undo*
			The last used search pattern and the redo command "."
			will not be changed by the function.  This also
			implies that the effect of |:nohlsearch| is undone
			when the function returns.

					*:endf* *:endfunction* *E126* *E193*
:endf[unction]		The end of a function definition.  Must be on a line
			by its own, without other commands.

					*:delf* *:delfunction* *E130* *E131*
:delf[unction] {name}	Delete function {name}.
			{name} can also be a |Dictionary| entry that is a
			|Funcref|: >
				:delfunc dict.init
<			This will remove the "init" entry from "dict".	The
			function is deleted if there are no more references to
			it.
							*:retu* *:return* *E133*
:retu[rn] [expr]	Return from a function.  When "[expr]" is given, it is
			evaluated and returned as the result of the function.
			If "[expr]" is not given, the number 0 is returned.
			When a function ends without an explicit ":return",
			the number 0 is returned.
			Note that there is no check for unreachable lines,
			thus there is no warning if commands follow ":return".

			If the ":return" is used after a |:try| but before the
			matching |:finally| (if present), the commands
			following the ":finally" up to the matching |:endtry|
			are executed first.  This process applies to all
			nested ":try"s inside the function.  The function
			returns at the outermost ":endtry".

						*function-argument* *a:var*
An argument can be defined by giving its name.	In the function this can then
be used as "a:name" ("a:" for argument).
					*a:0* *a:1* *a:000* *E740* *...*
Up to 20 arguments can be given, separated by commas.  After the named
arguments an argument "..." can be specified, which means that more arguments
may optionally be following.  In the function the extra arguments can be used
as "a:1", "a:2", etc.  "a:0" is set to the number of extra arguments (which
can be 0).  "a:000" is set to a |List| that contains these arguments.  Note
that "a:1" is the same as "a:000[0]".
								*E742*
The a: scope and the variables in it cannot be changed, they are fixed.
However, if a |List| or |Dictionary| is used, you can change their contents.
Thus you can pass a |List| to a function and have the function add an item to
it.  If you want to make sure the function cannot change a |List| or
|Dictionary| use |:lockvar|.

When not using "...", the number of arguments in a function call must be equal
to the number of named arguments.  When using "...", the number of arguments
may be larger.

It is also possible to define a function without any arguments.  You must
still supply the () then.  The body of the function follows in the next lines,
until the matching |:endfunction|.  It is allowed to define another function
inside a function body.

							*local-variables*
Inside a function variables can be used.  These are local variables, which
will disappear when the function returns.  Global variables need to be
accessed with "g:".

Example: >
  :function Table(title, ...)
  :  echohl Title
  :  echo a:title
  :  echohl None
  :  echo a:0 . " items:"
  :  for s in a:000
  :    echon ' ' . s
  :  endfor
  :endfunction

This function can then be called with: >
  call Table("Table", "line1", "line2")
  call Table("Empty Table")

To return more than one value, return a |List|: >
  :function Compute(n1, n2)
  :  if a:n2 == 0
  :    return ["fail", 0]
  :  endif
  :  return ["ok", a:n1 / a:n2]
  :endfunction

This function can then be called with: >
  :let [success, div] = Compute(102, 6)
  :if success == "ok"
  :  echo div
  :endif
<
						*:cal* *:call* *E107* *E117*
:[range]cal[l] {name}([arguments])
		Call a function.  The name of the function and its arguments
		are as specified with |:function|.  Up to 20 arguments can be
		used.  The returned value is discarded.
		Without a range and for functions that accept a range, the
		function is called once.  When a range is given the cursor is
		positioned at the start of the first line before executing the
		function.
		When a range is given and the function doesn't handle it
		itself, the function is executed for each line in the range,
		with the cursor in the first column of that line.  The cursor
		is left at the last line (possibly moved by the last function
		call).	The arguments are re-evaluated for each line.  Thus
		this works:
						*function-range-example*  >
	:function Mynumber(arg)
	:  echo line(".") . " " . a:arg
	:endfunction
	:1,5call Mynumber(getline("."))
<
		The "a:firstline" and "a:lastline" are defined anyway, they
		can be used to do something different at the start or end of
		the range.

		Example of a function that handles the range itself: >

	:function Cont() range
	:  execute (a:firstline + 1) . "," . a:lastline . 's/^/\t\\ '
	:endfunction
	:4,8call Cont()
<
		This function inserts the continuation character "\" in front
		of all the lines in the range, except the first one.

		When the function returns a composite value it can be further
		dereferenced, but the range will not be used then.  Example: >
	:4,8call GetDict().method()
<		Here GetDict() gets the range but method() does not.

								*E132*
The recursiveness of user functions is restricted with the |'maxfuncdepth'|
option.


AUTOMATICALLY LOADING FUNCTIONS ~
							*autoload-functions*
When using many or large functions, it's possible to automatically define them
only when they are used.  There are two methods: with an autocommand and with
the "autoload" directory in 'runtimepath'.


Using an autocommand ~

This is introduced in the user manual, section |41.14|.

The autocommand is useful if you have a plugin that is a long Vim script file.
You can define the autocommand and quickly quit the script with |:finish|.
That makes Vim startup faster.	The autocommand should then load the same file
again, setting a variable to skip the |:finish| command.

Use the FuncUndefined autocommand event with a pattern that matches the
function(s) to be defined.  Example: >

	:au FuncUndefined BufNet* source ~/vim/bufnetfuncs.vim

The file "~/vim/bufnetfuncs.vim" should then define functions that start with
"BufNet".  Also see |FuncUndefined|.


Using an autoload script ~
							*autoload* *E746*
This is introduced in the user manual, section |41.15|.

Using a script in the "autoload" directory is simpler, but requires using
exactly the right file name.  A function that can be autoloaded has a name
like this: >

	:call filename#funcname()

When such a function is called, and it is not defined yet, Vim will search the
"autoload" directories in 'runtimepath' for a script file called
"filename.vim".  For example "~/.config/nvim/autoload/filename.vim".  That 
file should then define the function like this: >

	function filename#funcname()
	   echo "Done!"
	endfunction

The file name and the name used before the # in the function must match
exactly, and the defined function must have the name exactly as it will be
called.

It is possible to use subdirectories.  Every # in the function name works like
a path separator.  Thus when calling a function: >

	:call foo#bar#func()

Vim will look for the file "autoload/foo/bar.vim" in 'runtimepath'.

This also works when reading a variable that has not been set yet: >

	:let l = foo#bar#lvar

However, when the autoload script was already loaded it won't be loaded again
for an unknown variable.

When assigning a value to such a variable nothing special happens.  This can
be used to pass settings to the autoload script before it's loaded: >

	:let foo#bar#toggle = 1
	:call foo#bar#func()

Note that when you make a mistake and call a function that is supposed to be
defined in an autoload script, but the script doesn't actually define the
function, the script will be sourced every time you try to call the function.
And you will get an error message every time.

Also note that if you have two script files, and one calls a function in the
other and vice versa, before the used function is defined, it won't work.
Avoid using the autoload functionality at the toplevel.

Hint: If you distribute a bunch of scripts you can pack them together with the
|vimball| utility.  Also read the user manual |distribute-script|.

==============================================================================
6. Curly braces names					*curly-braces-names*

In most places where you can use a variable, you can use a "curly braces name"
variable.  This is a regular variable name with one or more expressions
wrapped in braces {} like this: >
	my_{adjective}_variable

When Vim encounters this, it evaluates the expression inside the braces, puts
that in place of the expression, and re-interprets the whole as a variable
name.  So in the above example, if the variable "adjective" was set to
"noisy", then the reference would be to "my_noisy_variable", whereas if
"adjective" was set to "quiet", then it would be to "my_quiet_variable".

One application for this is to create a set of variables governed by an option
value.	For example, the statement >
	echo my_{&background}_message

would output the contents of "my_dark_message" or "my_light_message" depending
on the current value of 'background'.

You can use multiple brace pairs: >
	echo my_{adverb}_{adjective}_message
..or even nest them: >
	echo my_{ad{end_of_word}}_message
where "end_of_word" is either "verb" or "jective".

However, the expression inside the braces must evaluate to a valid single
variable name, e.g. this is invalid: >
	:let foo='a + b'
	:echo c{foo}d
.. since the result of expansion is "ca + bd", which is not a variable name.

						*curly-braces-function-names*
You can call and define functions by an evaluated name in a similar way.
Example: >
	:let func_end='whizz'
	:call my_func_{func_end}(parameter)

This would call the function "my_func_whizz(parameter)".

This does NOT work: >
  :let i = 3
  :let @{i} = ''  " error
  :echo @{i}      " error

==============================================================================
7. Commands						*expression-commands*

:let {var-name} = {expr1}				*:let* *E18*
			Set internal variable {var-name} to the result of the
			expression {expr1}.  The variable will get the type
			from the {expr}.  If {var-name} didn't exist yet, it
			is created.

:let {var-name}[{idx}] = {expr1}			*E689*
			Set a list item to the result of the expression
			{expr1}.  {var-name} must refer to a list and {idx}
			must be a valid index in that list.  For nested list
			the index can be repeated.
			This cannot be used to add an item to a |List|.
			This cannot be used to set a byte in a String.	You
			can do that like this: >
				:let var = var[0:2] . 'X' . var[4:]
<
							*E711* *E719*
:let {var-name}[{idx1}:{idx2}] = {expr1}		*E708* *E709* *E710*
			Set a sequence of items in a |List| to the result of
			the expression {expr1}, which must be a list with the
			correct number of items.
			{idx1} can be omitted, zero is used instead.
			{idx2} can be omitted, meaning the end of the list.
			When the selected range of items is partly past the
			end of the list, items will be added.

					*:let+=* *:let-=* *:let.=* *E734*
:let {var} += {expr1}	Like ":let {var} = {var} + {expr1}".
:let {var} -= {expr1}	Like ":let {var} = {var} - {expr1}".
:let {var} .= {expr1}	Like ":let {var} = {var} . {expr1}".
			These fail if {var} was not set yet and when the type
			of {var} and {expr1} don't fit the operator.


:let ${env-name} = {expr1}			*:let-environment* *:let-$*
			Set environment variable {env-name} to the result of
			the expression {expr1}.  The type is always String.
:let ${env-name} .= {expr1}
			Append {expr1} to the environment variable {env-name}.
			If the environment variable didn't exist yet this
			works like "=".

:let @{reg-name} = {expr1}			*:let-register* *:let-@*
			Write the result of the expression {expr1} in register
			{reg-name}.  {reg-name} must be a single letter, and
			must be the name of a writable register (see
			|registers|).  "@@" can be used for the unnamed
			register, "@/" for the search pattern.
			If the result of {expr1} ends in a <CR> or <NL>, the
			register will be linewise, otherwise it will be set to
			characterwise.
			This can be used to clear the last search pattern: >
				:let @/ = ""
<			This is different from searching for an empty string,
			that would match everywhere.

:let @{reg-name} .= {expr1}
			Append {expr1} to register {reg-name}.	If the
			register was empty it's like setting it to {expr1}.

:let &{option-name} = {expr1}			*:let-option* *:let-&*
			Set option {option-name} to the result of the
			expression {expr1}.  A String or Number value is
			always converted to the type of the option.
			For an option local to a window or buffer the effect
			is just like using the |:set| command: both the local
			value and the global value are changed.
			Example: >
				:let &path = &path . ',/usr/local/include'

:let &{option-name} .= {expr1}
			For a string option: Append {expr1} to the value.
			Does not insert a comma like |:set+=|.

:let &{option-name} += {expr1}
:let &{option-name} -= {expr1}
			For a number or boolean option: Add or subtract
			{expr1}.

:let &l:{option-name} = {expr1}
:let &l:{option-name} .= {expr1}
:let &l:{option-name} += {expr1}
:let &l:{option-name} -= {expr1}
			Like above, but only set the local value of an option
			(if there is one).  Works like |:setlocal|.

:let &g:{option-name} = {expr1}
:let &g:{option-name} .= {expr1}
:let &g:{option-name} += {expr1}
:let &g:{option-name} -= {expr1}
			Like above, but only set the global value of an option
			(if there is one).  Works like |:setglobal|.

:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] = {expr1}		*:let-unpack* *E687* *E688*
			{expr1} must evaluate to a |List|.  The first item in
			the list is assigned to {name1}, the second item to
			{name2}, etc.
			The number of names must match the number of items in
			the |List|.
			Each name can be one of the items of the ":let"
			command as mentioned above.
			Example: >
				:let [s, item] = GetItem(s)
<			Detail: {expr1} is evaluated first, then the
			assignments are done in sequence.  This matters if
			{name2} depends on {name1}.  Example: >
				:let x = [0, 1]
				:let i = 0
				:let [i, x[i]] = [1, 2]
				:echo x
<			The result is [0, 2].

:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] .= {expr1}
:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] += {expr1}
:let [{name1}, {name2}, ...] -= {expr1}
			Like above, but append/add/subtract the value for each
			|List| item.

:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] = {expr1}
			Like |:let-unpack| above, but the |List| may have more
			items than there are names.  A list of the remaining
			items is assigned to {lastname}.  If there are no
			remaining items {lastname} is set to an empty list.
			Example: >
				:let [a, b; rest] = ["aval", "bval", 3, 4]
<
:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] .= {expr1}
:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] += {expr1}
:let [{name}, ..., ; {lastname}] -= {expr1}
			Like above, but append/add/subtract the value for each
			|List| item.

								*E121*
:let {var-name}	..	List the value of variable {var-name}.	Multiple
			variable names may be given.  Special names recognized
			here:				*E738*
			  g:	global variables
			  b:	local buffer variables
			  w:	local window variables
			  t:	local tab page variables
			  s:	script-local variables
			  l:	local function variables
			  v:	Vim variables.

:let			List the values of all variables.  The type of the
			variable is indicated before the value:
			    <nothing>	String
				#	Number
				*	Funcref


:unl[et][!] {name} ...				*:unlet* *:unl* *E108* *E795*
			Remove the internal variable {name}.  Several variable
			names can be given, they are all removed.  The name
			may also be a |List| or |Dictionary| item.
			With [!] no error message is given for non-existing
			variables.
			One or more items from a |List| can be removed: >
				:unlet list[3]	  " remove fourth item
				:unlet list[3:]   " remove fourth item to last
<			One item from a |Dictionary| can be removed at a time: >
				:unlet dict['two']
				:unlet dict.two
<			This is especially useful to clean up used global
			variables and script-local variables (these are not
			deleted when the script ends).  Function-local
			variables are automatically deleted when the function
			ends.

:lockv[ar][!] [depth] {name} ...			*:lockvar* *:lockv*
			Lock the internal variable {name}.  Locking means that
			it can no longer be changed (until it is unlocked).
			A locked variable can be deleted: >
				:lockvar v
				:let v = 'asdf'		" fails!
				:unlet v
<							*E741*
			If you try to change a locked variable you get an
			error message: "E741: Value is locked: {name}"

			[depth] is relevant when locking a |List| or
			|Dictionary|.  It specifies how deep the locking goes:
				1	Lock the |List| or |Dictionary| itself,
					cannot add or remove items, but can
					still change their values.
				2	Also lock the values, cannot change
					the items.  If an item is a |List| or
					|Dictionary|, cannot add or remove
					items, but can still change the
					values.
				3	Like 2 but for the |List| /
					|Dictionary| in the |List| /
					|Dictionary|, one level deeper.
			The default [depth] is 2, thus when {name} is a |List|
			or |Dictionary| the values cannot be changed.
								*E743*
			For unlimited depth use [!] and omit [depth].
			However, there is a maximum depth of 100 to catch
			loops.

			Note that when two variables refer to the same |List|
			and you lock one of them, the |List| will also be
			locked when used through the other variable.
			Example: >
				:let l = [0, 1, 2, 3]
				:let cl = l
				:lockvar l
				:let cl[1] = 99		" won't work!
<			You may want to make a copy of a list to avoid this.
			See |deepcopy()|.


:unlo[ckvar][!] [depth] {name} ...			*:unlockvar* *:unlo*
			Unlock the internal variable {name}.  Does the
			opposite of |:lockvar|.


:if {expr1}			*:if* *:endif* *:en* *E171* *E579* *E580*
:en[dif]		Execute the commands until the next matching ":else"
			or ":endif" if {expr1} evaluates to non-zero.

			From Vim version 4.5 until 5.0, every Ex command in
			between the ":if" and ":endif" is ignored.  These two
			commands were just to allow for future expansions in a
			backward compatible way.  Nesting was allowed.  Note
			that any ":else" or ":elseif" was ignored, the "else"
			part was not executed either.

			You can use this to remain compatible with older
			versions: >
				:if version >= 500
				:  version-5-specific-commands
				:endif
<			The commands still need to be parsed to find the
			"endif".  Sometimes an older Vim has a problem with a
			new command.  For example, ":silent" is recognized as
			a ":substitute" command.  In that case ":execute" can
			avoid problems: >
				:if version >= 600
				:  execute "silent 1,$delete"
				:endif
<
			NOTE: The ":append" and ":insert" commands don't work
			properly in between ":if" and ":endif".

						*:else* *:el* *E581* *E583*
:el[se]			Execute the commands until the next matching ":else"
			or ":endif" if they previously were not being
			executed.

					*:elseif* *:elsei* *E582* *E584*
:elsei[f] {expr1}	Short for ":else" ":if", with the addition that there
			is no extra ":endif".

:wh[ile] {expr1}			*:while* *:endwhile* *:wh* *:endw*
						*E170* *E585* *E588* *E733*
:endw[hile]		Repeat the commands between ":while" and ":endwhile",
			as long as {expr1} evaluates to non-zero.
			When an error is detected from a command inside the
			loop, execution continues after the "endwhile".
			Example: >
				:let lnum = 1
				:while lnum <= line("$")
				   :call FixLine(lnum)
				   :let lnum = lnum + 1
				:endwhile
<
			NOTE: The ":append" and ":insert" commands don't work
			properly inside a ":while" and ":for" loop.

:for {var} in {list}					*:for* *E690* *E732*
:endfo[r]						*:endfo* *:endfor*
			Repeat the commands between ":for" and ":endfor" for
			each item in {list}.  Variable {var} is set to the
			value of each item.
			When an error is detected for a command inside the
			loop, execution continues after the "endfor".
			Changing {list} inside the loop affects what items are
			used.  Make a copy if this is unwanted: >
				:for item in copy(mylist)
<			When not making a copy, Vim stores a reference to the
			next item in the list, before executing the commands
			with the current item.	Thus the current item can be
			removed without effect.  Removing any later item means
			it will not be found.  Thus the following example
			works (an inefficient way to make a list empty): >
				for item in mylist
				   call remove(mylist, 0)
				endfor
<			Note that reordering the list (e.g., with sort() or
			reverse()) may have unexpected effects.
			Note that the type of each list item should be
			identical to avoid errors for the type of {var}
			changing.  Unlet the variable at the end of the loop
			to allow multiple item types: >
				for item in ["foo", ["bar"]]
				   echo item
				   unlet item  " E706 without this
				endfor

:for [{var1}, {var2}, ...] in {listlist}
:endfo[r]
			Like ":for" above, but each item in {listlist} must be
			a list, of which each item is assigned to {var1},
			{var2}, etc.  Example: >
				:for [lnum, col] in [[1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 8]]
				   :echo getline(lnum)[col]
				:endfor
<
						*:continue* *:con* *E586*
:con[tinue]		When used inside a ":while" or ":for" loop, jumps back
			to the start of the loop.
			If it is used after a |:try| inside the loop but
			before the matching |:finally| (if present), the
			commands following the ":finally" up to the matching
			|:endtry| are executed first.  This process applies to
			all nested ":try"s inside the loop.  The outermost
			":endtry" then jumps back to the start of the loop.

						*:break* *:brea* *E587*
:brea[k]		When used inside a ":while" or ":for" loop, skips to
			the command after the matching ":endwhile" or
			":endfor".
			If it is used after a |:try| inside the loop but
			before the matching |:finally| (if present), the
			commands following the ":finally" up to the matching
			|:endtry| are executed first.  This process applies to
			all nested ":try"s inside the loop.  The outermost
			":endtry" then jumps to the command after the loop.

:try				*:try* *:endt* *:endtry* *E600* *E601* *E602*
:endt[ry]		Change the error handling for the commands between
			":try" and ":endtry" including everything being
			executed across ":source" commands, function calls,
			or autocommand invocations.

			When an error or interrupt is detected and there is
			a |:finally| command following, execution continues
			after the ":finally".  Otherwise, or when the
			":endtry" is reached thereafter, the next
			(dynamically) surrounding ":try" is checked for
			a corresponding ":finally" etc.  Then the script
			processing is terminated.  (Whether a function
			definition has an "abort" argument does not matter.)
			Example: >
		:try | edit too much | finally | echo "cleanup" | endtry
		:echo "impossible"	" not reached, script terminated above
<
			Moreover, an error or interrupt (dynamically) inside
			":try" and ":endtry" is converted to an exception.  It
			can be caught as if it were thrown by a |:throw|
			command (see |:catch|).  In this case, the script
			processing is not terminated.

			The value "Vim:Interrupt" is used for an interrupt
			exception.  An error in a Vim command is converted
			to a value of the form "Vim({command}):{errmsg}",
			other errors are converted to a value of the form
			"Vim:{errmsg}".  {command} is the full command name,
			and {errmsg} is the message that is displayed if the
			error exception is not caught, always beginning with
			the error number.
			Examples: >
		:try | sleep 100 | catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/ | endtry
		:try | edit | catch /^Vim(edit):E\d\+/ | echo "error" | endtry
<
					*:cat* *:catch* *E603* *E604* *E605*
:cat[ch] /{pattern}/	The following commands until the next |:catch|,
			|:finally|, or |:endtry| that belongs to the same
			|:try| as the ":catch" are executed when an exception
			matching {pattern} is being thrown and has not yet
			been caught by a previous ":catch".  Otherwise, these
			commands are skipped.
			When {pattern} is omitted all errors are caught.
			Examples: >
		:catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/	" catch interrupts (CTRL-C)
		:catch /^Vim\%((\a\+)\)\=:E/	" catch all Vim errors
		:catch /^Vim\%((\a\+)\)\=:/	" catch errors and interrupts
		:catch /^Vim(write):/		" catch all errors in :write
		:catch /^Vim\%((\a\+)\)\=:E123/	" catch error E123
		:catch /my-exception/		" catch user exception
		:catch /.*/			" catch everything
		:catch				" same as /.*/
<
			Another character can be used instead of / around the
			{pattern}, so long as it does not have a special
			meaning (e.g., '|' or '"') and doesn't occur inside
			{pattern}.
			Information about the exception is available in
			|v:exception|.  Also see |throw-variables|.
			NOTE: It is not reliable to ":catch" the TEXT of
			an error message because it may vary in different
			locales.

					*:fina* *:finally* *E606* *E607*
:fina[lly]		The following commands until the matching |:endtry|
			are executed whenever the part between the matching
			|:try| and the ":finally" is left:  either by falling
			through to the ":finally" or by a |:continue|,
			|:break|, |:finish|, or |:return|, or by an error or
			interrupt or exception (see |:throw|).

							*:th* *:throw* *E608*
:th[row] {expr1}	The {expr1} is evaluated and thrown as an exception.
			If the ":throw" is used after a |:try| but before the
			first corresponding |:catch|, commands are skipped
			until the first ":catch" matching {expr1} is reached.
			If there is no such ":catch" or if the ":throw" is
			used after a ":catch" but before the |:finally|, the
			commands following the ":finally" (if present) up to
			the matching |:endtry| are executed.  If the ":throw"
			is after the ":finally", commands up to the ":endtry"
			are skipped.  At the ":endtry", this process applies
			again for the next dynamically surrounding ":try"
			(which may be found in a calling function or sourcing
			script), until a matching ":catch" has been found.
			If the exception is not caught, the command processing
			is terminated.
			Example: >
		:try | throw "oops" | catch /^oo/ | echo "caught" | endtry
<			Note that "catch" may need to be on a separate line
			for when an error causes the parsing to skip the whole
			line and not see the "|" that separates the commands.

							*:ec* *:echo*
:ec[ho] {expr1} ..	Echoes each {expr1}, with a space in between.  The
			first {expr1} starts on a new line.
			Also see |:comment|.
			Use "\n" to start a new line.  Use "\r" to move the
			cursor to the first column.
			Uses the highlighting set by the |:echohl| command.
			Cannot be followed by a comment.
			Example: >
		:echo "the value of 'shell' is" &shell
<							*:echo-redraw*
			A later redraw may make the message disappear again.
			And since Vim mostly postpones redrawing until it's
			finished with a sequence of commands this happens
			quite often.  To avoid that a command from before the
			":echo" causes a redraw afterwards (redraws are often
			postponed until you type something), force a redraw
			with the |:redraw| command.  Example: >
		:new | redraw | echo "there is a new window"
<							*:echo-self-refer*
			When printing nested containers echo prints second 
			occurrence of the self-referencing container using 
			"[...@level]" (self-referencing |List|) or 
			"{...@level}" (self-referencing |Dict|): >
		:let l = []
		:call add(l, l)
		:let l2 = []
		:call add(l2, [l2])
		:echo l l2
<			echoes "[[...@0]] [[[...@0]]]". Echoing "[l]" will 
			echo "[[[...@1]]]" because l first occurs at second 
			level.

							*:echon*
:echon {expr1} ..	Echoes each {expr1}, without anything added.  Also see
			|:comment|.
			Uses the highlighting set by the |:echohl| command.
			Cannot be followed by a comment.
			Example: >
				:echon "the value of 'shell' is " &shell
<
			Note the difference between using ":echo", which is a
			Vim command, and ":!echo", which is an external shell
			command: >
		:!echo %		--> filename
<			The arguments of ":!" are expanded, see |:_%|. >
		:!echo "%"		--> filename or "filename"
<			Like the previous example.  Whether you see the double
			quotes or not depends on your 'shell'. >
		:echo %			--> nothing
<			The '%' is an illegal character in an expression. >
		:echo "%"		--> %
<			This just echoes the '%' character. >
		:echo expand("%")	--> filename
<			This calls the expand() function to expand the '%'.

							*:echoh* *:echohl*
:echoh[l] {name}	Use the highlight group {name} for the following
			|:echo|, |:echon| and |:echomsg| commands.  Also used
			for the |input()| prompt.  Example: >
		:echohl WarningMsg | echo "Don't panic!" | echohl None
<			Don't forget to set the group back to "None",
			otherwise all following echo's will be highlighted.

							*:echom* *:echomsg*
:echom[sg] {expr1} ..	Echo the expression(s) as a true message, saving the
			message in the |message-history|.
			Spaces are placed between the arguments as with the
			|:echo| command.  But unprintable characters are
			displayed, not interpreted.
			The parsing works slightly different from |:echo|,
			more like |:execute|.  All the expressions are first
			evaluated and concatenated before echoing anything.
			The expressions must evaluate to a Number or String, a
			Dictionary or List causes an error.
			Uses the highlighting set by the |:echohl| command.
			Example: >
		:echomsg "It's a Zizzer Zazzer Zuzz, as you can plainly see."
<			See |:echo-redraw| to avoid the message disappearing
			when the screen is redrawn.
							*:echoe* *:echoerr*
:echoe[rr] {expr1} ..	Echo the expression(s) as an error message, saving the
			message in the |message-history|.  When used in a
			script or function the line number will be added.
			Spaces are placed between the arguments as with the
			:echo command.	When used inside a try conditional,
			the message is raised as an error exception instead
			(see |try-echoerr|).
			Example: >
		:echoerr "This script just failed!"
<			If you just want a highlighted message use |:echohl|.
			And to get a beep: >
		:exe "normal \<Esc>"
<
							*:exe* *:execute*
:exe[cute] {expr1} ..	Executes the string that results from the evaluation
			of {expr1} as an Ex command.
			Multiple arguments are concatenated, with a space in
			between.  To avoid the extra space use the "."
			operator to concatenate strings into one argument.
			{expr1} is used as the processed command, command line
			editing keys are not recognized.
			Cannot be followed by a comment.
			Examples: >
		:execute "buffer" nextbuf
		:execute "normal" count . "w"
<
			":execute" can be used to append a command to commands
			that don't accept a '|'.  Example: >
		:execute '!ls' | echo "theend"

<			":execute" is also a nice way to avoid having to type
			control characters in a Vim script for a ":normal"
			command: >
		:execute "normal ixxx\<Esc>"
<			This has an <Esc> character, see |expr-string|.

			Be careful to correctly escape special characters in
			file names.  The |fnameescape()| function can be used
			for Vim commands, |shellescape()| for |:!| commands.
			Examples: >
		:execute "e " . fnameescape(filename)
		:execute "!ls " . shellescape(filename, 1)
<
			Note: The executed string may be any command-line, but
			starting or ending "if", "while" and "for" does not
			always work, because when commands are skipped the
			":execute" is not evaluated and Vim loses track of
			where blocks start and end.  Also "break" and
			"continue" should not be inside ":execute".
			This example does not work, because the ":execute" is
			not evaluated and Vim does not see the "while", and
			gives an error for finding an ":endwhile": >
		:if 0
		: execute 'while i > 5'
		:  echo "test"
		: endwhile
		:endif
<
			It is allowed to have a "while" or "if" command
			completely in the executed string: >
		:execute 'while i < 5 | echo i | let i = i + 1 | endwhile'
<

							*:exe-comment*
			":execute", ":echo" and ":echon" cannot be followed by
			a comment directly, because they see the '"' as the
			start of a string.  But, you can use '|' followed by a
			comment.  Example: >
		:echo "foo" | "this is a comment

==============================================================================
8. Exception handling					*exception-handling*

The Vim script language comprises an exception handling feature.  This section
explains how it can be used in a Vim script.

Exceptions may be raised by Vim on an error or on interrupt, see
|catch-errors| and |catch-interrupt|.  You can also explicitly throw an
exception by using the ":throw" command, see |throw-catch|.


TRY CONDITIONALS					*try-conditionals*

Exceptions can be caught or can cause cleanup code to be executed.  You can
use a try conditional to specify catch clauses (that catch exceptions) and/or
a finally clause (to be executed for cleanup).
   A try conditional begins with a |:try| command and ends at the matching
|:endtry| command.  In between, you can use a |:catch| command to start
a catch clause, or a |:finally| command to start a finally clause.  There may
be none or multiple catch clauses, but there is at most one finally clause,
which must not be followed by any catch clauses.  The lines before the catch
clauses and the finally clause is called a try block. >

     :try
     :	...
     :	...				TRY BLOCK
     :	...
     :catch /{pattern}/
     :	...
     :	...				CATCH CLAUSE
     :	...
     :catch /{pattern}/
     :	...
     :	...				CATCH CLAUSE
     :	...
     :finally
     :	...
     :	...				FINALLY CLAUSE
     :	...
     :endtry

The try conditional allows to watch code for exceptions and to take the
appropriate actions.  Exceptions from the try block may be caught.  Exceptions
from the try block and also the catch clauses may cause cleanup actions.
   When no exception is thrown during execution of the try block, the control
is transferred to the finally clause, if present.  After its execution, the
script continues with the line following the ":endtry".
   When an exception occurs during execution of the try block, the remaining
lines in the try block are skipped.  The exception is matched against the
patterns specified as arguments to the ":catch" commands.  The catch clause
after the first matching ":catch" is taken, other catch clauses are not
executed.  The catch clause ends when the next ":catch", ":finally", or
":endtry" command is reached - whatever is first.  Then, the finally clause
(if present) is executed.  When the ":endtry" is reached, the script execution
continues in the following line as usual.
   When an exception that does not match any of the patterns specified by the
":catch" commands is thrown in the try block, the exception is not caught by
that try conditional and none of the catch clauses is executed.  Only the
finally clause, if present, is taken.  The exception pends during execution of
the finally clause.  It is resumed at the ":endtry", so that commands after
the ":endtry" are not executed and the exception might be caught elsewhere,
see |try-nesting|.
   When during execution of a catch clause another exception is thrown, the
remaining lines in that catch clause are not executed.	The new exception is
not matched against the patterns in any of the ":catch" commands of the same
try conditional and none of its catch clauses is taken.  If there is, however,
a finally clause, it is executed, and the exception pends during its
execution.  The commands following the ":endtry" are not executed.  The new
exception might, however, be caught elsewhere, see |try-nesting|.
   When during execution of the finally clause (if present) an exception is
thrown, the remaining lines in the finally clause are skipped.	If the finally
clause has been taken because of an exception from the try block or one of the
catch clauses, the original (pending) exception is discarded.  The commands
following the ":endtry" are not executed, and the exception from the finally
clause is propagated and can be caught elsewhere, see |try-nesting|.

The finally clause is also executed, when a ":break" or ":continue" for
a ":while" loop enclosing the complete try conditional is executed from the
try block or a catch clause.  Or when a ":return" or ":finish" is executed
from the try block or a catch clause of a try conditional in a function or
sourced script, respectively.  The ":break", ":continue", ":return", or
":finish" pends during execution of the finally clause and is resumed when the
":endtry" is reached.  It is, however, discarded when an exception is thrown
from the finally clause.
   When a ":break" or ":continue" for a ":while" loop enclosing the complete
try conditional or when a ":return" or ":finish" is encountered in the finally
clause, the rest of the finally clause is skipped, and the ":break",
":continue", ":return" or ":finish" is executed as usual.  If the finally
clause has been taken because of an exception or an earlier ":break",
":continue", ":return", or ":finish" from the try block or a catch clause,
this pending exception or command is discarded.

For examples see |throw-catch| and |try-finally|.


NESTING	OF TRY CONDITIONALS				*try-nesting*

Try conditionals can be nested arbitrarily.  That is, a complete try
conditional can be put into the try block, a catch clause, or the finally
clause of another try conditional.  If the inner try conditional does not
catch an exception thrown in its try block or throws a new exception from one
of its catch clauses or its finally clause, the outer try conditional is
checked according to the rules above.  If the inner try conditional is in the
try block of the outer try conditional, its catch clauses are checked, but
otherwise only the finally clause is executed.	It does not matter for
nesting, whether the inner try conditional is directly contained in the outer
one, or whether the outer one sources a script or calls a function containing
the inner try conditional.

When none of the active try conditionals catches an exception, just their
finally clauses are executed.  Thereafter, the script processing terminates.
An error message is displayed in case of an uncaught exception explicitly
thrown by a ":throw" command.  For uncaught error and interrupt exceptions
implicitly raised by Vim, the error message(s) or interrupt message are shown
as usual.

For examples see |throw-catch|.


EXAMINING EXCEPTION HANDLING CODE			*except-examine*

Exception handling code can get tricky.  If you are in doubt what happens, set
'verbose' to 13 or use the ":13verbose" command modifier when sourcing your
script file.  Then you see when an exception is thrown, discarded, caught, or
finished.  When using a verbosity level of at least 14, things pending in
a finally clause are also shown.  This information is also given in debug mode
(see |debug-scripts|).


THROWING AND CATCHING EXCEPTIONS			*throw-catch*

You can throw any number or string as an exception.  Use the |:throw| command
and pass the value to be thrown as argument: >
	:throw 4711
	:throw "string"
<							*throw-expression*
You can also specify an expression argument.  The expression is then evaluated
first, and the result is thrown: >
	:throw 4705 + strlen("string")
	:throw strpart("strings", 0, 6)

An exception might be thrown during evaluation of the argument of the ":throw"
command.  Unless it is caught there, the expression evaluation is abandoned.
The ":throw" command then does not throw a new exception.
   Example: >

	:function! Foo(arg)
	:  try
	:    throw a:arg
	:  catch /foo/
	:  endtry
	:  return 1
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Bar()
	:  echo "in Bar"
	:  return 4710
	:endfunction
	:
	:throw Foo("arrgh") + Bar()

This throws "arrgh", and "in Bar" is not displayed since Bar() is not
executed. >
	:throw Foo("foo") + Bar()
however displays "in Bar" and throws 4711.

Any other command that takes an expression as argument might also be
abandoned by an (uncaught) exception during the expression evaluation.	The
exception is then propagated to the caller of the command.
   Example: >

	:if Foo("arrgh")
	:  echo "then"
	:else
	:  echo "else"
	:endif

Here neither of "then" or "else" is displayed.

							*catch-order*
Exceptions can be caught by a try conditional with one or more |:catch|
commands, see |try-conditionals|.   The values to be caught by each ":catch"
command can be specified as a pattern argument.  The subsequent catch clause
gets executed when a matching exception is caught.
   Example: >

	:function! Foo(value)
	:  try
	:    throw a:value
	:  catch /^\d\+$/
	:    echo "Number thrown"
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo "String thrown"
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:call Foo(0x1267)
	:call Foo('string')

The first call to Foo() displays "Number thrown", the second "String thrown".
An exception is matched against the ":catch" commands in the order they are
specified.  Only the first match counts.  So you should place the more
specific ":catch" first.  The following order does not make sense: >

	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo "String thrown"
	:  catch /^\d\+$/
	:    echo "Number thrown"

The first ":catch" here matches always, so that the second catch clause is
never taken.

							*throw-variables*
If you catch an exception by a general pattern, you may access the exact value
in the variable |v:exception|: >

	:  catch /^\d\+$/
	:    echo "Number thrown.  Value is" v:exception

You may also be interested where an exception was thrown.  This is stored in
|v:throwpoint|.  Note that "v:exception" and "v:throwpoint" are valid for the
exception most recently caught as long it is not finished.
   Example: >

	:function! Caught()
	:  if v:exception != ""
	:    echo 'Caught "' . v:exception . '" in ' . v:throwpoint
	:  else
	:    echo 'Nothing caught'
	:  endif
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Foo()
	:  try
	:    try
	:      try
	:	 throw 4711
	:      finally
	:	 call Caught()
	:      endtry
	:    catch /.*/
	:      call Caught()
	:      throw "oops"
	:    endtry
	:  catch /.*/
	:    call Caught()
	:  finally
	:    call Caught()
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:call Foo()

This displays >

	Nothing caught
	Caught "4711" in function Foo, line 4
	Caught "oops" in function Foo, line 10
	Nothing caught

A practical example:  The following command ":LineNumber" displays the line
number in the script or function where it has been used: >

	:function! LineNumber()
	:    return substitute(v:throwpoint, '.*\D\(\d\+\).*', '\1', "")
	:endfunction
	:command! LineNumber try | throw "" | catch | echo LineNumber() | endtry
<
							*try-nested*
An exception that is not caught by a try conditional can be caught by
a surrounding try conditional: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    throw "foo"
	:  catch /foobar/
	:    echo "foobar"
	:  finally
	:    echo "inner finally"
	:  endtry
	:catch /foo/
	:  echo "foo"
	:endtry

The inner try conditional does not catch the exception, just its finally
clause is executed.  The exception is then caught by the outer try
conditional.  The example displays "inner finally" and then "foo".

							*throw-from-catch*
You can catch an exception and throw a new one to be caught elsewhere from the
catch clause: >

	:function! Foo()
	:  throw "foo"
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Bar()
	:  try
	:    call Foo()
	:  catch /foo/
	:    echo "Caught foo, throw bar"
	:    throw "bar"
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:try
	:  call Bar()
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo "Caught" v:exception
	:endtry

This displays "Caught foo, throw bar" and then "Caught bar".

							*rethrow*
There is no real rethrow in the Vim script language, but you may throw
"v:exception" instead: >

	:function! Bar()
	:  try
	:    call Foo()
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo "Rethrow" v:exception
	:    throw v:exception
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
<							*try-echoerr*
Note that this method cannot be used to "rethrow" Vim error or interrupt
exceptions, because it is not possible to fake Vim internal exceptions.
Trying so causes an error exception.  You should throw your own exception
denoting the situation.  If you want to cause a Vim error exception containing
the original error exception value, you can use the |:echoerr| command: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    asdf
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echoerr v:exception
	:  endtry
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry

This code displays

	Vim(echoerr):Vim:E492: Not an editor command:	asdf ~


CLEANUP CODE						*try-finally*

Scripts often change global settings and restore them at their end.  If the
user however interrupts the script by pressing CTRL-C, the settings remain in
an inconsistent state.	The same may happen to you in the development phase of
a script when an error occurs or you explicitly throw an exception without
catching it.  You can solve these problems by using a try conditional with
a finally clause for restoring the settings.  Its execution is guaranteed on
normal control flow, on error, on an explicit ":throw", and on interrupt.
(Note that errors and interrupts from inside the try conditional are converted
to exceptions.	When not caught, they terminate the script after the finally
clause has been executed.)
Example: >

	:try
	:  let s:saved_ts = &ts
	:  set ts=17
	:
	:  " Do the hard work here.
	:
	:finally
	:  let &ts = s:saved_ts
	:  unlet s:saved_ts
	:endtry

This method should be used locally whenever a function or part of a script
changes global settings which need to be restored on failure or normal exit of
that function or script part.

							*break-finally*
Cleanup code works also when the try block or a catch clause is left by
a ":continue", ":break", ":return", or ":finish".
   Example: >

	:let first = 1
	:while 1
	:  try
	:    if first
	:      echo "first"
	:      let first = 0
	:      continue
	:    else
	:      throw "second"
	:    endif
	:  catch /.*/
	:    echo v:exception
	:    break
	:  finally
	:    echo "cleanup"
	:  endtry
	:  echo "still in while"
	:endwhile
	:echo "end"

This displays "first", "cleanup", "second", "cleanup", and "end". >

	:function! Foo()
	:  try
	:    return 4711
	:  finally
	:    echo "cleanup\n"
	:  endtry
	:  echo "Foo still active"
	:endfunction
	:
	:echo Foo() "returned by Foo"

This displays "cleanup" and "4711 returned by Foo".  You don't need to add an
extra ":return" in the finally clause.	(Above all, this would override the
return value.)

							*except-from-finally*
Using either of ":continue", ":break", ":return", ":finish", or ":throw" in
a finally clause is possible, but not recommended since it abandons the
cleanup actions for the try conditional.  But, of course, interrupt and error
exceptions might get raised from a finally clause.
   Example where an error in the finally clause stops an interrupt from
working correctly: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    echo "Press CTRL-C for interrupt"
	:    while 1
	:    endwhile
	:  finally
	:    unlet novar
	:  endtry
	:catch /novar/
	:endtry
	:echo "Script still running"
	:sleep 1

If you need to put commands that could fail into a finally clause, you should
think about catching or ignoring the errors in these commands, see
|catch-errors| and |ignore-errors|.


CATCHING ERRORS						*catch-errors*

If you want to catch specific errors, you just have to put the code to be
watched in a try block and add a catch clause for the error message.  The
presence of the try conditional causes all errors to be converted to an
exception.  No message is displayed and |v:errmsg| is not set then.  To find
the right pattern for the ":catch" command, you have to know how the format of
the error exception is.
   Error exceptions have the following format: >

	Vim({cmdname}):{errmsg}
or >
	Vim:{errmsg}

{cmdname} is the name of the command that failed; the second form is used when
the command name is not known.	{errmsg} is the error message usually produced
when the error occurs outside try conditionals.  It always begins with
a capital "E", followed by a two or three-digit error number, a colon, and
a space.

Examples:

The command >
	:unlet novar
normally produces the error message >
	E108: No such variable: "novar"
which is converted inside try conditionals to an exception >
	Vim(unlet):E108: No such variable: "novar"

The command >
	:dwim
normally produces the error message >
	E492: Not an editor command: dwim
which is converted inside try conditionals to an exception >
	Vim:E492: Not an editor command: dwim

You can catch all ":unlet" errors by a >
	:catch /^Vim(unlet):/
or all errors for misspelled command names by a >
	:catch /^Vim:E492:/

Some error messages may be produced by different commands: >
	:function nofunc
and >
	:delfunction nofunc
both produce the error message >
	E128: Function name must start with a capital: nofunc
which is converted inside try conditionals to an exception >
	Vim(function):E128: Function name must start with a capital: nofunc
or >
	Vim(delfunction):E128: Function name must start with a capital: nofunc
respectively.  You can catch the error by its number independently on the
command that caused it if you use the following pattern: >
	:catch /^Vim(\a\+):E128:/

Some commands like >
	:let x = novar
produce multiple error messages, here: >
	E121: Undefined variable: novar
	E15: Invalid expression:  novar
Only the first is used for the exception value, since it is the most specific
one (see |except-several-errors|).  So you can catch it by >
	:catch /^Vim(\a\+):E121:/

You can catch all errors related to the name "nofunc" by >
	:catch /\<nofunc\>/

You can catch all Vim errors in the ":write" and ":read" commands by >
	:catch /^Vim(\(write\|read\)):E\d\+:/

You can catch all Vim errors by the pattern >
	:catch /^Vim\((\a\+)\)\=:E\d\+:/
<
							*catch-text*
NOTE: You should never catch the error message text itself: >
	:catch /No such variable/
only works in the English locale, but not when the user has selected
a different language by the |:language| command.  It is however helpful to
cite the message text in a comment: >
	:catch /^Vim(\a\+):E108:/   " No such variable


IGNORING ERRORS						*ignore-errors*

You can ignore errors in a specific Vim command by catching them locally: >

	:try
	:  write
	:catch
	:endtry

But you are strongly recommended NOT to use this simple form, since it could
catch more than you want.  With the ":write" command, some autocommands could
be executed and cause errors not related to writing, for instance: >

	:au BufWritePre * unlet novar

There could even be such errors you are not responsible for as a script
writer: a user of your script might have defined such autocommands.  You would
then hide the error from the user.
   It is much better to use >

	:try
	:  write
	:catch /^Vim(write):/
	:endtry

which only catches real write errors.  So catch only what you'd like to ignore
intentionally.

For a single command that does not cause execution of autocommands, you could
even suppress the conversion of errors to exceptions by the ":silent!"
command: >
	:silent! nunmap k
This works also when a try conditional is active.


CATCHING INTERRUPTS					*catch-interrupt*

When there are active try conditionals, an interrupt (CTRL-C) is converted to
the exception "Vim:Interrupt".	You can catch it like every exception.	The
script is not terminated, then.
   Example: >

	:function! TASK1()
	:  sleep 10
	:endfunction

	:function! TASK2()
	:  sleep 20
	:endfunction

	:while 1
	:  let command = input("Type a command: ")
	:  try
	:    if command == ""
	:      continue
	:    elseif command == "END"
	:      break
	:    elseif command == "TASK1"
	:      call TASK1()
	:    elseif command == "TASK2"
	:      call TASK2()
	:    else
	:      echo "\nIllegal command:" command
	:      continue
	:    endif
	:  catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/
	:    echo "\nCommand interrupted"
	:    " Caught the interrupt.  Continue with next prompt.
	:  endtry
	:endwhile

You can interrupt a task here by pressing CTRL-C; the script then asks for
a new command.	If you press CTRL-C at the prompt, the script is terminated.

For testing what happens when CTRL-C would be pressed on a specific line in
your script, use the debug mode and execute the |>quit| or |>interrupt|
command on that line.  See |debug-scripts|.


CATCHING ALL						*catch-all*

The commands >

	:catch /.*/
	:catch //
	:catch

catch everything, error exceptions, interrupt exceptions and exceptions
explicitly thrown by the |:throw| command.  This is useful at the top level of
a script in order to catch unexpected things.
   Example: >

	:try
	:
	:  " do the hard work here
	:
	:catch /MyException/
	:
	:  " handle known problem
	:
	:catch /^Vim:Interrupt$/
	:    echo "Script interrupted"
	:catch /.*/
	:  echo "Internal error (" . v:exception . ")"
	:  echo " - occurred at " . v:throwpoint
	:endtry
	:" end of script

Note: Catching all might catch more things than you want.  Thus, you are
strongly encouraged to catch only for problems that you can really handle by
specifying a pattern argument to the ":catch".
   Example: Catching all could make it nearly impossible to interrupt a script
by pressing CTRL-C: >

	:while 1
	:  try
	:    sleep 1
	:  catch
	:  endtry
	:endwhile


EXCEPTIONS AND AUTOCOMMANDS				*except-autocmd*

Exceptions may be used during execution of autocommands.  Example: >

	:autocmd User x try
	:autocmd User x   throw "Oops!"
	:autocmd User x catch
	:autocmd User x   echo v:exception
	:autocmd User x endtry
	:autocmd User x throw "Arrgh!"
	:autocmd User x echo "Should not be displayed"
	:
	:try
	:  doautocmd User x
	:catch
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry

This displays "Oops!" and "Arrgh!".

							*except-autocmd-Pre*
For some commands, autocommands get executed before the main action of the
command takes place.  If an exception is thrown and not caught in the sequence
of autocommands, the sequence and the command that caused its execution are
abandoned and the exception is propagated to the caller of the command.
   Example: >

	:autocmd BufWritePre * throw "FAIL"
	:autocmd BufWritePre * echo "Should not be displayed"
	:
	:try
	:  write
	:catch
	:  echo "Caught:" v:exception "from" v:throwpoint
	:endtry

Here, the ":write" command does not write the file currently being edited (as
you can see by checking 'modified'), since the exception from the BufWritePre
autocommand abandons the ":write".  The exception is then caught and the
script displays: >

	Caught: FAIL from BufWrite Auto commands for "*"
<
							*except-autocmd-Post*
For some commands, autocommands get executed after the main action of the
command has taken place.  If this main action fails and the command is inside
an active try conditional, the autocommands are skipped and an error exception
is thrown that can be caught by the caller of the command.
   Example: >

	:autocmd BufWritePost * echo "File successfully written!"
	:
	:try
	:  write /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:catch
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry

This just displays: >

	Vim(write):E212: Can't open file for writing (/i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e)

If you really need to execute the autocommands even when the main action
fails, trigger the event from the catch clause.
   Example: >

	:autocmd BufWritePre  * set noreadonly
	:autocmd BufWritePost * set readonly
	:
	:try
	:  write /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:catch
	:  doautocmd BufWritePost /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:endtry
<
You can also use ":silent!": >

	:let x = "ok"
	:let v:errmsg = ""
	:autocmd BufWritePost * if v:errmsg != ""
	:autocmd BufWritePost *   let x = "after fail"
	:autocmd BufWritePost * endif
	:try
	:  silent! write /i/m/p/o/s/s/i/b/l/e
	:catch
	:endtry
	:echo x

This displays "after fail".

If the main action of the command does not fail, exceptions from the
autocommands will be catchable by the caller of the command:  >

	:autocmd BufWritePost * throw ":-("
	:autocmd BufWritePost * echo "Should not be displayed"
	:
	:try
	:  write
	:catch
	:  echo v:exception
	:endtry
<
							*except-autocmd-Cmd*
For some commands, the normal action can be replaced by a sequence of
autocommands.  Exceptions from that sequence will be catchable by the caller
of the command.
   Example:  For the ":write" command, the caller cannot know whether the file
had actually been written when the exception occurred.	You need to tell it in
some way. >

	:if !exists("cnt")
	:  let cnt = 0
	:
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd * if &modified
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   let cnt = cnt + 1
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   if cnt % 3 == 2
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *     throw "BufWriteCmdError"
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   endif
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   write | set nomodified
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   if cnt % 3 == 0
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *     throw "BufWriteCmdError"
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   endif
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd *   echo "File successfully written!"
	:  autocmd BufWriteCmd * endif
	:endif
	:
	:try
	:	write
	:catch /^BufWriteCmdError$/
	:  if &modified
	:    echo "Error on writing (file contents not changed)"
	:  else
	:    echo "Error after writing"
	:  endif
	:catch /^Vim(write):/
	:    echo "Error on writing"
	:endtry

When this script is sourced several times after making changes, it displays
first >
	File successfully written!
then >
	Error on writing (file contents not changed)
then >
	Error after writing
etc.

							*except-autocmd-ill*
You cannot spread a try conditional over autocommands for different events.
The following code is ill-formed: >

	:autocmd BufWritePre  * try
	:
	:autocmd BufWritePost * catch
	:autocmd BufWritePost *   echo v:exception
	:autocmd BufWritePost * endtry
	:
	:write


EXCEPTION HIERARCHIES AND PARAMETERIZED EXCEPTIONS	*except-hier-param*

Some programming languages allow to use hierarchies of exception classes or to
pass additional information with the object of an exception class.  You can do
similar things in Vim.
   In order to throw an exception from a hierarchy, just throw the complete
class name with the components separated by a colon, for instance throw the
string "EXCEPT:MATHERR:OVERFLOW" for an overflow in a mathematical library.
   When you want to pass additional information with your exception class, add
it in parentheses, for instance throw the string "EXCEPT:IO:WRITEERR(myfile)"
for an error when writing "myfile".
   With the appropriate patterns in the ":catch" command, you can catch for
base classes or derived classes of your hierarchy.  Additional information in
parentheses can be cut out from |v:exception| with the ":substitute" command.
   Example: >

	:function! CheckRange(a, func)
	:  if a:a < 0
	:    throw "EXCEPT:MATHERR:RANGE(" . a:func . ")"
	:  endif
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Add(a, b)
	:  call CheckRange(a:a, "Add")
	:  call CheckRange(a:b, "Add")
	:  let c = a:a + a:b
	:  if c < 0
	:    throw "EXCEPT:MATHERR:OVERFLOW"
	:  endif
	:  return c
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Div(a, b)
	:  call CheckRange(a:a, "Div")
	:  call CheckRange(a:b, "Div")
	:  if (a:b == 0)
	:    throw "EXCEPT:MATHERR:ZERODIV"
	:  endif
	:  return a:a / a:b
	:endfunction
	:
	:function! Write(file)
	:  try
	:    execute "write" fnameescape(a:file)
	:  catch /^Vim(write):/
	:    throw "EXCEPT:IO(" . getcwd() . ", " . a:file . "):WRITEERR"
	:  endtry
	:endfunction
	:
	:try
	:
	:  " something with arithmetics and I/O
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT:MATHERR:RANGE/
	:  let function = substitute(v:exception, '.*(\(\a\+\)).*', '\1', "")
	:  echo "Range error in" function
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT:MATHERR/	" catches OVERFLOW and ZERODIV
	:  echo "Math error"
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT:IO/
	:  let dir = substitute(v:exception, '.*(\(.\+\),\s*.\+).*', '\1', "")
	:  let file = substitute(v:exception, '.*(.\+,\s*\(.\+\)).*', '\1', "")
	:  if file !~ '^/'
	:    let file = dir . "/" . file
	:  endif
	:  echo 'I/O error for "' . file . '"'
	:
	:catch /^EXCEPT/
	:  echo "Unspecified error"
	:
	:endtry

The exceptions raised by Vim itself (on error or when pressing CTRL-C) use
a flat hierarchy:  they are all in the "Vim" class.  You cannot throw yourself
exceptions with the "Vim" prefix; they are reserved for Vim.
   Vim error exceptions are parameterized with the name of the command that
failed, if known.  See |catch-errors|.


PECULIARITIES
							*except-compat*
The exception handling concept requires that the command sequence causing the
exception is aborted immediately and control is transferred to finally clauses
and/or a catch clause.

In the Vim script language there are cases where scripts and functions
continue after an error: in functions without the "abort" flag or in a command
after ":silent!", control flow goes to the following line, and outside
functions, control flow goes to the line following the outermost ":endwhile"
or ":endif".  On the other hand, errors should be catchable as exceptions
(thus, requiring the immediate abortion).

This problem has been solved by converting errors to exceptions and using
immediate abortion (if not suppressed by ":silent!") only when a try
conditional is active.	This is no restriction since an (error) exception can
be caught only from an active try conditional.	If you want an immediate
termination without catching the error, just use a try conditional without
catch clause.  (You can cause cleanup code being executed before termination
by specifying a finally clause.)

When no try conditional is active, the usual abortion and continuation
behavior is used instead of immediate abortion.  This ensures compatibility of
scripts written for Vim 6.1 and earlier.

However, when sourcing an existing script that does not use exception handling
commands (or when calling one of its functions) from inside an active try
conditional of a new script, you might change the control flow of the existing
script on error.  You get the immediate abortion on error and can catch the
error in the new script.  If however the sourced script suppresses error
messages by using the ":silent!" command (checking for errors by testing
|v:errmsg| if appropriate), its execution path is not changed.	The error is
not converted to an exception.	(See |:silent|.)  So the only remaining cause
where this happens is for scripts that don't care about errors and produce
error messages.  You probably won't want to use such code from your new
scripts.

							*except-syntax-err*
Syntax errors in the exception handling commands are never caught by any of
the ":catch" commands of the try conditional they belong to.  Its finally
clauses, however, is executed.
   Example: >

	:try
	:  try
	:    throw 4711
	:  catch /\(/
	:    echo "in catch with syntax error"
	:  catch
	:    echo "inner catch-all"
	:  finally
	:    echo "inner finally"
	:  endtry
	:catch
	:  echo 'outer catch-all caught "' . v:exception . '"'
	:  finally
	:    echo "outer finally"
	:endtry

This displays: >
    inner finally
    outer catch-all caught "Vim(catch):E54: Unmatched \("
    outer finally
The original exception is discarded and an error exception is raised, instead.

							*except-single-line*
The ":try", ":catch", ":finally", and ":endtry" commands can be put on
a single line, but then syntax errors may make it difficult to recognize the
"catch" line, thus you better avoid this.
   Example: >
	:try | unlet! foo # | catch | endtry
raises an error exception for the trailing characters after the ":unlet!"
argument, but does not see the ":catch" and ":endtry" commands, so that the
error exception is discarded and the "E488: Trailing characters" message gets
displayed.

							*except-several-errors*
When several errors appear in a single command, the first error message is
usually the most specific one and therefor converted to the error exception.
   Example: >
	echo novar
causes >
	E121: Undefined variable: novar
	E15: Invalid expression: novar
The value of the error exception inside try conditionals is: >
	Vim(echo):E121: Undefined variable: novar
<							*except-syntax-error*
But when a syntax error is detected after a normal error in the same command,
the syntax error is used for the exception being thrown.
   Example: >
	unlet novar #
causes >
	E108: No such variable: "novar"
	E488: Trailing characters
The value of the error exception inside try conditionals is: >
	Vim(unlet):E488: Trailing characters
This is done because the syntax error might change the execution path in a way
not intended by the user.  Example: >
	try
	    try | unlet novar # | catch | echo v:exception | endtry
	catch /.*/
	    echo "outer catch:" v:exception
	endtry
This displays "outer catch: Vim(unlet):E488: Trailing characters", and then
a "E600: Missing :endtry" error message is given, see |except-single-line|.

9. Examples						*eval-examples*

Printing in Binary ~
>
  :" The function Nr2Bin() returns the binary string representation of a number.
  :func Nr2Bin(nr)
  :  let n = a:nr
  :  let r = ""
  :  while n
  :    let r = '01'[n % 2] . r
  :    let n = n / 2
  :  endwhile
  :  return r
  :endfunc

  :" The function String2Bin() converts each character in a string to a
  :" binary string, separated with dashes.
  :func String2Bin(str)
  :  let out = ''
  :  for ix in range(strlen(a:str))
  :    let out = out . '-' . Nr2Bin(char2nr(a:str[ix]))
  :  endfor
  :  return out[1:]
  :endfunc

Example of its use: >
  :echo Nr2Bin(32)
result: "100000" >
  :echo String2Bin("32")
result: "110011-110010"


Sorting lines ~

This example sorts lines with a specific compare function. >

  :func SortBuffer()
  :  let lines = getline(1, '$')
  :  call sort(lines, function("Strcmp"))
  :  call setline(1, lines)
  :endfunction

As a one-liner: >
  :call setline(1, sort(getline(1, '$'), function("Strcmp")))


scanf() replacement ~
							*sscanf*
There is no sscanf() function in Vim.  If you need to extract parts from a
line, you can use matchstr() and substitute() to do it.  This example shows
how to get the file name, line number and column number out of a line like
"foobar.txt, 123, 45". >
   :" Set up the match bit
   :let mx='\(\f\+\),\s*\(\d\+\),\s*\(\d\+\)'
   :"get the part matching the whole expression
   :let l = matchstr(line, mx)
   :"get each item out of the match
   :let file = substitute(l, mx, '\1', '')
   :let lnum = substitute(l, mx, '\2', '')
   :let col = substitute(l, mx, '\3', '')

The input is in the variable "line", the results in the variables "file",
"lnum" and "col". (idea from Michael Geddes)


getting the scriptnames in a Dictionary ~
						*scriptnames-dictionary*
The |:scriptnames| command can be used to get a list of all script files that
have been sourced.  There is no equivalent function or variable for this
(because it's rarely needed).  In case you need to manipulate the list this
code can be used: >
    " Get the output of ":scriptnames" in the scriptnames_output variable.
    let scriptnames_output = ''
    redir => scriptnames_output
    silent scriptnames
    redir END
    
    " Split the output into lines and parse each line.	Add an entry to the
    " "scripts" dictionary.
    let scripts = {}
    for line in split(scriptnames_output, "\n")
      " Only do non-blank lines.
      if line =~ '\S'
	" Get the first number in the line.
	let nr = matchstr(line, '\d\+')
	" Get the file name, remove the script number " 123: ".
	let name = substitute(line, '.\+:\s*', '', '')
	" Add an item to the Dictionary
	let scripts[nr] = name
      endif
    endfor
    unlet scriptnames_output

==============================================================================
10. No +eval feature				*no-eval-feature*

When the |+eval| feature was disabled at compile time, none of the expression
evaluation commands are available.  To prevent this from causing Vim scripts
to generate all kinds of errors, the ":if" and ":endif" commands are still
recognized, though the argument of the ":if" and everything between the ":if"
and the matching ":endif" is ignored.  Nesting of ":if" blocks is allowed, but
only if the commands are at the start of the line.  The ":else" command is not
recognized.

Example of how to avoid executing commands when the |+eval| feature is
missing: >

	:if 1
	:  echo "Expression evaluation is compiled in"
	:else
	:  echo "You will _never_ see this message"
	:endif

==============================================================================
11. The sandbox					*eval-sandbox* *sandbox* *E48*

The 'foldexpr', 'formatexpr', 'includeexpr', 'indentexpr', 'statusline' and
'foldtext' options may be evaluated in a sandbox.  This means that you are
protected from these expressions having nasty side effects.  This gives some
safety for when these options are set from a modeline.  It is also used when
the command from a tags file is executed and for CTRL-R = in the command line.
The sandbox is also used for the |:sandbox| command.

These items are not allowed in the sandbox:
	- changing the buffer text
	- defining or changing mapping, autocommands, functions, user commands
	- setting certain options (see |option-summary|)
	- setting certain v: variables (see |v:var|)  *E794*
	- executing a shell command
	- reading or writing a file
	- jumping to another buffer or editing a file
	- executing Python, Perl, etc. commands
This is not guaranteed 100% secure, but it should block most attacks.

							*:san* *:sandbox*
:san[dbox] {cmd}	Execute {cmd} in the sandbox.  Useful to evaluate an
			option that may have been set from a modeline, e.g.
			'foldexpr'.

							*sandbox-option*
A few options contain an expression.  When this expression is evaluated it may
have to be done in the sandbox to avoid a security risk.  But the sandbox is
restrictive, thus this only happens when the option was set from an insecure
location.  Insecure in this context are:
- sourcing a .nvimrc or .exrc in the current directory
- while executing in the sandbox
- value coming from a modeline

Note that when in the sandbox and saving an option value and restoring it, the
option will still be marked as it was set in the sandbox.

==============================================================================
12. Textlock							*textlock*

In a few situations it is not allowed to change the text in the buffer, jump
to another window and some other things that might confuse or break what Vim
is currently doing.  This mostly applies to things that happen when Vim is
actually doing something else.	For example, evaluating the 'balloonexpr' may
happen any moment the mouse cursor is resting at some position.

This is not allowed when the textlock is active:
	- changing the buffer text
	- jumping to another buffer or window
	- editing another file
	- closing a window or quitting Vim
	- etc.

Last change: 2016 Jul 12


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL	  by Bram Moolenaar


Options							*options*

1. Setting options			|set-option|
2. Automatically setting options	|auto-setting|
3. Options summary			|option-summary|

For an overview of options see help.txt |option-list|.

Vim has a number of internal variables and switches which can be set to
achieve special effects.  These options come in three forms:
	boolean		can only be on or off		*boolean* *toggle*
	number		has a numeric value
	string		has a string value

==============================================================================
1. Setting options					*set-option* *E764*

							*:se* *:set*
:se[t]			Show all options that differ from their default value.

:se[t] all		Show all but terminal options.

:se[t] termcap		Show all terminal options.  Note that in the GUI the
			key codes are not shown, because they are generated
			internally and can't be changed.  Changing the terminal
			codes in the GUI is not useful either...

								*E518* *E519*
:se[t] {option}?	Show value of {option}.

:se[t] {option}		Toggle option: set, switch it on.
			Number option: show value.
			String option: show value.

:se[t] no{option}	Toggle option: Reset, switch it off.

							   *:set-!* *:set-inv*
:se[t] {option}!   or
:se[t] inv{option}	Toggle option: Invert value.

				*:set-default* *:set-&* *:set-&vi* *:set-&vim*
:se[t] {option}&	Reset option to its default value.
:se[t] {option}&vi	Reset option to its Vi default value.
:se[t] {option}&vim	Reset option to its Vim default value.

:se[t] all&		Set all options to their default value.  The values of
			these options are not changed:
			  'columns'
			  'lines'
			Warning: This may have a lot of side effects.

						*:set-args* *E487* *E521*
:se[t] {option}={value}		or
:se[t] {option}:{value}
			Set string or number option to {value}.
			For numeric options the value can be given in decimal,
			hex (preceded with 0x) or octal (preceded with '0').
			The old value can be inserted by typing 'wildchar' (by
			default this is a <Tab>).  See |cmdline-completion|.
			White space between {option} and '=' is allowed and
			will be ignored.  White space between '=' and {value}
			is not allowed.
			See |option-backslash| for using white space and
			backslashes in {value}.

:se[t] {option}+={value}				*:set+=*
			Add the {value} to a number option, or append the
			{value} to a string option.  When the option is a
			comma separated list, a comma is added, unless the
			value was empty.
			If the option is a list of flags, superfluous flags
			are removed.  When adding a flag that was already
			present the option value doesn't change.
			Also see |:set-args| above.

:se[t] {option}^={value}				*:set^=*
			Multiply the {value} to a number option, or prepend
			the {value} to a string option.  When the option is a
			comma separated list, a comma is added, unless the
			value was empty.
			Also see |:set-args| above.

:se[t] {option}-={value}				*:set-=*
			Subtract the {value} from a number option, or remove
			the {value} from a string option, if it is there.
			If the {value} is not found in a string option, there
			is no error or warning.  When the option is a comma
			separated list, a comma is deleted, unless the option
			becomes empty.
			When the option is a list of flags, {value} must be
			exactly as they appear in the option.  Remove flags
			one by one to avoid problems.
			Also see |:set-args| above.

The {option} arguments to ":set" may be repeated.  For example: >
	:set ai nosi sw=3 ts=3
If you make an error in one of the arguments, an error message will be given
and the following arguments will be ignored.

							*:set-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, displaying an option value will also tell where it
was last set.  Example: >
	:verbose set shiftwidth cindent?
<	  shiftwidth=4 ~
		  Last set from modeline ~
	  cindent ~
		  Last set from /usr/local/share/vim/vim60/ftplugin/c.vim ~
This is only done when specific option values are requested, not for ":verbose
set all" or ":verbose set" without an argument.
When the option was set by hand there is no "Last set" message.
When the option was set while executing a function, user command or
autocommand, the script in which it was defined is reported.
A few special texts:
	Last set from modeline ~
		Option was set in a |modeline|.
	Last set from --cmd argument ~
		Option was set with command line argument |--cmd| or +.
	Last set from -c argument ~
		Option was set with command line argument |-c|, +, |-S| or
		|-q|.
	Last set from environment variable ~
		Option was set from an environment variable, $VIMINIT,
		$GVIMINIT or $EXINIT.
	Last set from error handler ~
		Option was cleared when evaluating it resulted in an error.

{not available when compiled without the |+eval| feature}

							*:set-termcap* *E522*
For {option} the form "t_xx" may be used to set a terminal option.  This will
override the value from the termcap.  You can then use it in a mapping.  If
the "xx" part contains special characters, use the <t_xx> form: >
	:set <t_#4>=^[Ot
This can also be used to translate a special code for a normal key.  For
example, if Alt-b produces <Esc>b, use this: >
	:set <M-b>=^[b
(the ^[ is a real <Esc> here, use CTRL-V <Esc> to enter it)
The advantage over a mapping is that it works in all situations.

You can define any key codes, e.g.: >
	:set t_xy=^[foo;
There is no warning for using a name that isn't recognized.  You can map these
codes as you like: >
	:map <t_xy> something
<								*E846*
When a key code is not set, it's like it does not exist.  Trying to get its
value will result in an error: >
	:set t_kb=
	:set t_kb
	E846: Key code not set: t_kb

The t_xx options cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
security reasons.

The listing from ":set" looks different from Vi.  Long string options are put
at the end of the list.  The number of options is quite large.  The output of
"set all" probably does not fit on the screen, causing Vim to give the
|more-prompt|.

							*option-backslash*
To include white space in a string option value it has to be preceded with a
backslash.  To include a backslash you have to use two.  Effectively this
means that the number of backslashes in an option value is halved (rounded
down).
A few examples: >
   :set tags=tags\ /usr/tags	    results in "tags /usr/tags"
   :set tags=tags\\,file	    results in "tags\,file"
   :set tags=tags\\\ file	    results in "tags\ file"

The "|" character separates a ":set" command from a following command.  To
include the "|" in the option value, use "\|" instead.  This example sets the
'titlestring' option to "hi|there": >
   :set titlestring=hi\|there
This sets the 'titlestring' option to "hi" and 'iconstring' to "there": >
   :set titlestring=hi|set iconstring=there

Similarly, the double quote character starts a comment.  To include the '"' in
the option value, use '\"' instead.  This example sets the 'titlestring'
option to 'hi "there"': >
   :set titlestring=hi\ \"there\"

For Windows backslashes in file names are mostly not removed.  More
precise: For options that expect a file name (those where environment
variables are expanded) a backslash before a normal file name character is not
removed.  But a backslash before a special character (space, backslash, comma,
etc.) is used like explained above.
There is one special situation, when the value starts with "\\": >
   :set dir=\\machine\path	    results in "\\machine\path"
   :set dir=\\\\machine\\path	    results in "\\machine\path"
   :set dir=\\path\\file	    results in "\\path\file" (wrong!)
For the first one the start is kept, but for the second one the backslashes
are halved.  This makes sure it works both when you expect backslashes to be
halved and when you expect the backslashes to be kept.  The third gives a
result which is probably not what you want.  Avoid it.

				*add-option-flags* *remove-option-flags*
				*E539* *E550* *E551* *E552*
Some options are a list of flags.  When you want to add a flag to such an
option, without changing the existing ones, you can do it like this: >
   :set guioptions+=a
Remove a flag from an option like this: >
   :set guioptions-=a
This removes the 'a' flag from 'guioptions'.
Note that you should add or remove one flag at a time.  If 'guioptions' has
the value "ab", using "set guioptions-=ba" won't work, because the string "ba"
doesn't appear.

			   *:set_env* *expand-env* *expand-environment-var*
Environment variables in specific string options will be expanded.  If the
environment variable exists the '$' and the following environment variable
name is replaced with its value.  If it does not exist the '$' and the name
are not modified.  Any non-id character (not a letter, digit or '_') may
follow the environment variable name.  That character and what follows is
appended to the value of the environment variable.  Examples: >
   :set term=$TERM.new
   :set path=/usr/$INCLUDE,$HOME/include,.
When adding or removing a string from an option with ":set opt-=val" or ":set
opt+=val" the expansion is done before the adding or removing.


Handling of local options			*local-options*

Some of the options only apply to a window or buffer.  Each window or buffer
has its own copy of this option, thus can each have their own value.  This
allows you to set 'list' in one window but not in another.  And set
'shiftwidth' to 3 in one buffer and 4 in another.

The following explains what happens to these local options in specific
situations.  You don't really need to know all of this, since Vim mostly uses
the option values you would expect.  Unfortunately, doing what the user
expects is a bit complicated...

When splitting a window, the local options are copied to the new window.  Thus
right after the split the contents of the two windows look the same.

When editing a new buffer, its local option values must be initialized.  Since
the local options of the current buffer might be specifically for that buffer,
these are not used.  Instead, for each buffer-local option there also is a
global value, which is used for new buffers.  With ":set" both the local and
global value is changed.  With "setlocal" only the local value is changed,
thus this value is not used when editing a new buffer.

When editing a buffer that has been edited before, the last used window
options are used again.  If this buffer has been edited in this window, the
values from back then are used.  Otherwise the values from the window where
the buffer was edited last are used.

It's possible to set a local window option specifically for a type of buffer.
When you edit another buffer in the same window, you don't want to keep
using these local window options.  Therefore Vim keeps a global value of the
local window options, which is used when editing another buffer.  Each window
has its own copy of these values.  Thus these are local to the window, but
global to all buffers in the window.  With this you can do: >
	:e one
	:set list
	:e two
Now the 'list' option will also be set in "two", since with the ":set list"
command you have also set the global value. >
	:set nolist
	:e one
	:setlocal list
	:e two
Now the 'list' option is not set, because ":set nolist" resets the global
value, ":setlocal list" only changes the local value and ":e two" gets the
global value.  Note that if you do this next: >
	:e one
You will get back the 'list' value as it was the last time you edited "one".
The options local to a window are remembered for each buffer.  This also
happens when the buffer is not loaded, but they are lost when the buffer is
wiped out |:bwipe|.

							*:setl* *:setlocal*
:setl[ocal] ...		Like ":set" but set only the value local to the
			current buffer or window.  Not all options have a
			local value.  If the option does not have a local
			value the global value is set.
			With the "all" argument: display local values for all
			local options.
			Without argument: Display local values for all local
			options which are different from the default.
			When displaying a specific local option, show the
			local value.  For a global/local boolean option, when
			the global value is being used, "--" is displayed
			before the option name.
			For a global option the global value is
			shown (but that might change in the future).

:setl[ocal] {option}<	Set the local value of {option} to its global value by
			copying the value.

:se[t] {option}<	For |global-local| options: Remove the local value of
			{option}, so that the global value will be used.

							*:setg* *:setglobal*
:setg[lobal] ...	Like ":set" but set only the global value for a local
			option without changing the local value.
			When displaying an option, the global value is shown.
			With the "all" argument: display global values for all
			local options.
			Without argument: display global values for all local
			options which are different from the default.

For buffer-local and window-local options:
	Command		 global value	    local value ~
      :set option=value	     set		set
 :setlocal option=value	      -			set
:setglobal option=value	     set		 -
      :set option?	      -		       display
 :setlocal option?	      -		       display
:setglobal option?	    display		 -


Global options with a local value			*global-local*

Options are global when you mostly use one value for all buffers and windows.
For some global options it's useful to sometimes have a different local value.
You can set the local value with ":setlocal".  That buffer or window will then
use the local value, while other buffers and windows continue using the global
value.

For example, you have two windows, both on C source code.  They use the global
'makeprg' option.  If you do this in one of the two windows: >
	:set makeprg=gmake
then the other window will switch to the same value.  There is no need to set
the 'makeprg' option in the other C source window too.
However, if you start editing a Perl file in a new window, you want to use
another 'makeprg' for it, without changing the value used for the C source
files.  You use this command: >
	:setlocal makeprg=perlmake
You can switch back to using the global value by making the local value empty: >
	:setlocal makeprg=
This only works for a string option.  For a boolean option you need to use the
"<" flag, like this: >
	:setlocal autoread<
Note that for non-boolean options using "<" copies the global value to the
local value, it doesn't switch back to using the global value (that matters
when the global value changes later).  You can also use: >
	:set path<
This will make the local value of 'path' empty, so that the global value is
used.  Thus it does the same as: >
	:setlocal path=
Note: In the future more global options can be made global-local.  Using
":setlocal" on a global option might work differently then.


Setting the filetype

:setf[iletype] {filetype}			*:setf* *:setfiletype*
			Set the 'filetype' option to {filetype}, but only if
			not done yet in a sequence of (nested) autocommands.
			This is short for: >
				:if !did_filetype()
				:  setlocal filetype={filetype}
				:endif
<			This command is used in a filetype.vim file to avoid
			setting the 'filetype' option twice, causing different
			settings and syntax files to be loaded.

				*option-window* *optwin*
:bro[wse] se[t]			*:set-browse* *:browse-set* *:opt* *:options*
:opt[ions]		Open a window for viewing and setting all options.
			Options are grouped by function.
			Offers short help for each option.  Hit <CR> on the
			short help to open a help window with more help for
			the option.
			Modify the value of the option and hit <CR> on the
			"set" line to set the new value.  For window and
			buffer specific options, the last accessed window is
			used to set the option value in, unless this is a help
			window, in which case the window below help window is
			used (skipping the option-window).

								*$HOME*
Using "~" is like using "$HOME", but it is only recognized at the start of an
option and after a space or comma.

On Unix systems "~user" can be used too.  It is replaced by the home directory
of user "user".  Example: >
    :set path=~mool/include,/usr/include,.

On Unix systems the form "${HOME}" can be used too.  The name between {} can
contain non-id characters then.  Note that if you want to use this for the
"gf" command, you need to add the '{' and '}' characters to 'isfname'.

On MS-Windows, if $HOME is not defined as an environment variable, then
at runtime Vim will set it to the expansion of $HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH.

NOTE: expanding environment variables and "~/" is only done with the ":set"
command, not when assigning a value to an option with ":let".


Note the maximum length of an expanded option is limited.  How much depends on
the system, mostly it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.

							*Linux-backspace*
			Note about Linux: By default the backspace key
			produces CTRL-?, which is wrong.  You can fix it by
			putting this line in your rc.local: >
				echo "keycode 14 = BackSpace" | loadkeys
<
							*NetBSD-backspace*
			Note about NetBSD: If your backspace doesn't produce
			the right code, try this: >
				xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"
<			If this works, add this in your .Xmodmap file: >
				keysym 22 = BackSpace
<			You need to restart for this to take effect.

==============================================================================
2. Automatically setting options			*auto-setting*

Besides changing options with the ":set" command, there are three alternatives
to set options automatically for one or more files:

1. When starting Vim initializations are read from various places.  See
   |initialization|.  Most of them are performed for all editing sessions,
   and some of them depend on the directory where Vim is started.
   You can create an initialization file with |:mkvimrc|, |:mkview| and
   |:mksession|.
2. If you start editing a new file, the automatic commands are executed.
   This can be used to set options for files matching a particular pattern and
   many other things.  See |autocommand|.
3. If you start editing a new file, and the 'modeline' option is on, a
   number of lines at the beginning and end of the file are checked for
   modelines.  This is explained here.

					*modeline* *vim:* *vi:* *ex:* *E520*
There are two forms of modelines.  The first form:
	[text]{white}{vi:|vim:|ex:}[white]{options}

[text]			any text or empty
{white}			at least one blank character (<Space> or <Tab>)
{vi:|vim:|ex:}		the string "vi:", "vim:" or "ex:"
[white]			optional white space
{options}		a list of option settings, separated with white space
			or ':', where each part between ':' is the argument
			for a ":set" command (can be empty)

Examples:
   vi:noai:sw=3 ts=6 ~
   vim: tw=77 ~

The second form (this is compatible with some versions of Vi):

	[text]{white}{vi:|vim:|Vim:|ex:}[white]se[t] {options}:[text]

[text]			any text or empty
{white}			at least one blank character (<Space> or <Tab>)
{vi:|vim:|Vim:|ex:}	the string "vi:", "vim:", "Vim:" or "ex:"
[white]			optional white space
se[t]			the string "set " or "se " (note the space); When
			"Vim" is used it must be "set".
{options}		a list of options, separated with white space, which
			is the argument for a ":set" command
:			a colon
[text]			any text or empty

Examples:
   /* vim: set ai tw=75: */ ~
   /* Vim: set ai tw=75: */ ~

The white space before {vi:|vim:|Vim:|ex:} is required.  This minimizes the
chance that a normal word like "lex:" is caught.  There is one exception:
"vi:" and "vim:" can also be at the start of the line (for compatibility with
version 3.0).  Using "ex:" at the start of the line will be ignored (this
could be short for "example:").

							*modeline-local*
The options are set like with ":setlocal": The new value only applies to the
buffer and window that contain the file.  Although it's possible to set global
options from a modeline, this is unusual.  If you have two windows open and
the files in it set the same global option to a different value, the result
depends on which one was opened last.

When editing a file that was already loaded, only the window-local options
from the modeline are used.  Thus if you manually changed a buffer-local
option after opening the file, it won't be changed if you edit the same buffer
in another window.  But window-local options will be set.

							*modeline-version*
If the modeline is only to be used for some versions of Vim, the version
number can be specified where "vim:" or "Vim:" is used:
	vim{vers}:	version {vers} or later
	vim<{vers}:	version before {vers}
	vim={vers}:	version {vers}
	vim>{vers}:	version after {vers}
{vers} is 700 for Vim 7.0 (hundred times the major version plus minor).
For example, to use a modeline only for Vim 7.0:
	/* vim700: set foldmethod=marker */ ~
To use a modeline for Vim after version 7.2:
	/* vim>702: set cole=2: */ ~
There can be no blanks between "vim" and the ":".
The modeline is ignored if {vers} does not fit in an integer. {Nvim}


The number of lines that are checked can be set with the 'modelines' option.
If 'modeline' is off or 'modelines' is 0 no lines are checked.

Note that for the first form all of the rest of the line is used, thus a line
like:
   /* vi:ts=4: */ ~
will give an error message for the trailing "*/".  This line is OK:
   /* vi:set ts=4: */ ~

If an error is detected the rest of the line is skipped.

If you want to include a ':' in a set command precede it with a '\'.  The
backslash in front of the ':' will be removed.  Example:
   /* vi:set dir=c\:\tmp: */ ~
This sets the 'dir' option to "c:\tmp".  Only a single backslash before the
':' is removed.  Thus to include "\:" you have to specify "\\:".

No other commands than "set" are supported, for security reasons (somebody
might create a Trojan horse text file with modelines).  And not all options
can be set.  For some options a flag is set, so that when it's used the
|sandbox| is effective.  Still, there is always a small risk that a modeline
causes trouble.  E.g., when some joker sets 'textwidth' to 5 all your lines
are wrapped unexpectedly.  So disable modelines before editing untrusted text.
The mail ftplugin does this, for example.

Hint: If you would like to do something else than setting an option, you could
define an autocommand that checks the file for a specific string.  For
example: >
	au BufReadPost * if getline(1) =~ "VAR" | call SetVar() | endif
And define a function SetVar() that does something with the line containing
"VAR".

==============================================================================
3. Options summary					*option-summary*

In the list below all the options are mentioned with their full name and with
an abbreviation if there is one.  Both forms may be used.

In this document when a boolean option is "set" that means that ":set option"
is entered.  When an option is "reset", ":set nooption" is used.

Most options are the same in all windows and buffers.  There are a few that
are specific to how the text is presented in a window.  These can be set to a
different value in each window.  For example the 'list' option can be set in
one window and reset in another for the same text, giving both types of view
at the same time.  There are a few options that are specific to a certain
file.  These can have a different value for each file or buffer.  For example
the 'textwidth' option can be 78 for a normal text file and 0 for a C
program.

	global			one option for all buffers and windows
	local to window		each window has its own copy of this option
	local to buffer		each buffer has its own copy of this option

When creating a new window the option values from the currently active window
are used as a default value for the window-specific options.  For the
buffer-specific options this depends on the 's' and 'S' flags in the
'cpoptions' option.  If 's' is included (which is the default) the values for
buffer options are copied from the currently active buffer when a buffer is
first entered.  If 'S' is present the options are copied each time the buffer
is entered, this is almost like having global options.  If 's' and 'S' are not
present, the options are copied from the currently active buffer when the
buffer is created.

Hidden options						*hidden-options*

Not all options are supported in all versions.  This depends on the supported
features and sometimes on the system.  A remark about this is in curly braces
below.  When an option is not supported it may still be set without getting an
error, this is called a hidden option.  You can't get the value of a hidden
option though, it is not stored.

To test if option "foo" can be used with ":set" use something like this: >
	if exists('&foo')
This also returns true for a hidden option.  To test if option "foo" is really
supported use something like this: >
	if exists('+foo')
<
							*E355*
A jump table for the options with a short description can be found at |Q_op|.

					*'aleph'* *'al'* *aleph* *Aleph*
'aleph' 'al'		number	(default 224)
			global
	The ASCII code for the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.  The
	routine that maps the keyboard in Hebrew mode, both in Insert mode
	(when hkmap is set) and on the command-line (when hitting CTRL-_)
	outputs the Hebrew characters in the range [aleph..aleph+26].
	aleph=128 applies to PC code, and aleph=224 applies to ISO 8859-8.
	See |rileft.txt|.

			*'allowrevins'* *'ari'* *'noallowrevins'* *'noari'*
'allowrevins' 'ari'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Allow CTRL-_ in Insert and Command-line mode.  This is default off, to
	avoid that users that accidentally type CTRL-_ instead of SHIFT-_ get
	into reverse Insert mode, and don't know how to get out.  See
	'revins'.

			 *'altkeymap'* *'akm'* *'noaltkeymap'* *'noakm'*
'altkeymap' 'akm'	boolean (default off)
			global
	When on, the second language is Farsi.  In editing mode CTRL-_ toggles
	the keyboard map between Farsi and English, when 'allowrevins' set.

	When off, the keyboard map toggles between Hebrew and English.  This
	is useful to start the Vim in native mode i.e. English (left-to-right
	mode) and have default second language Farsi or Hebrew (right-to-left
	mode).  See |farsi.txt|.

						*'ambiwidth'* *'ambw'*
'ambiwidth' 'ambw'	string (default: "single")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	Tells Vim what to do with characters with East Asian Width Class
	Ambiguous (such as Euro, Registered Sign, Copyright Sign, Greek
	letters, Cyrillic letters).

	There are currently two possible values:
	"single":	Use the same width as characters in US-ASCII.  This is
			expected by most users.
	"double":	Use twice the width of ASCII characters.
							*E834* *E835*
	The value "double" cannot be used if 'listchars' or 'fillchars'
	contains a character that would be double width.

	There are a number of CJK fonts for which the width of glyphs for
	those characters are solely based on how many octets they take in
	legacy/traditional CJK encodings.  In those encodings, Euro,
	Registered sign, Greek/Cyrillic letters are represented by two octets,
	therefore those fonts have "wide" glyphs for them.  This is also
	true of some line drawing characters used to make tables in text
	file.  Therefore, when a CJK font is used for GUI Vim or
	Vim is running inside a terminal (emulators) that uses a CJK font
	(or Vim is run inside an xterm invoked with "-cjkwidth" option.),
	this option should be set to "double" to match the width perceived
	by Vim with the width of glyphs in the font.  Perhaps it also has
	to be set to "double" under CJK Windows XP when the system locale is
	set to one of CJK locales.
	See Unicode Standard Annex #11 (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11).

	Vim may set this option automatically at startup time when Vim is
	compiled with the |+termresponse| feature and if |t_u7| is set to the
	escape sequence to request cursor position report.

			*'autochdir'* *'acd'* *'noautochdir'* *'noacd'*
'autochdir' 'acd'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{only available when compiled with it, use
			exists("+autochdir") to check}
	When on, Vim will change the current working directory whenever you
	open a file, switch buffers, delete a buffer or open/close a window.
	It will change to the directory containing the file which was opened
	or selected.
	Note: When this option is on some plugins may not work.

				*'arabic'* *'arab'* *'noarabic'* *'noarab'*
'arabic' 'arab'		boolean (default off)
			local to window
	This option can be set to start editing Arabic text.
	Setting this option will:
	- Set the 'rightleft' option, unless 'termbidi' is set.
	- Set the 'arabicshape' option, unless 'termbidi' is set.
	- Set the 'keymap' option to "arabic"; in Insert mode CTRL-^ toggles
	  between typing English and Arabic key mapping.
	- Set the 'delcombine' option

	Resetting this option will:
	- Reset the 'rightleft' option.
	- Disable the use of 'keymap' (without changing its value).
	Note that 'arabicshape' and 'delcombine' are not reset (it is a global
	option).
	Also see |arabic.txt|.

					*'arabicshape'* *'arshape'*
					*'noarabicshape'* *'noarshape'*
'arabicshape' 'arshape'	boolean (default on)
			global
	When on and 'termbidi' is off, the required visual character
	corrections that need to take place for displaying the Arabic language
	take effect.  Shaping, in essence, gets enabled; the term is a broad
	one which encompasses:
	  a) the changing/morphing of characters based on their location
	     within a word (initial, medial, final and stand-alone).
	  b) the enabling of the ability to compose characters
	  c) the enabling of the required combining of some characters
	When disabled the display shows each character's true stand-alone
	form.
	Arabic is a complex language which requires other settings, for
	further details see |arabic.txt|.

			*'autoindent'* *'ai'* *'noautoindent'* *'noai'*
'autoindent' 'ai'	boolean	(default on)
			local to buffer
	Copy indent from current line when starting a new line (typing <CR>
	in Insert mode or when using the "o" or "O" command).  If you do not
	type anything on the new line except <BS> or CTRL-D and then type
	<Esc>, CTRL-O or <CR>, the indent is deleted again.  Moving the cursor
	to another line has the same effect, unless the 'I' flag is included
	in 'cpoptions'.
	When autoindent is on, formatting (with the "gq" command or when you
	reach 'textwidth' in Insert mode) uses the indentation of the first
	line.
	When 'smartindent' or 'cindent' is on the indent is changed in
	a different way.
	The 'autoindent' option is reset when the 'paste' option is set and
	restored when 'paste' is reset.
	{small difference from Vi: After the indent is deleted when typing
	<Esc> or <CR>, the cursor position when moving up or down is after the
	deleted indent; Vi puts the cursor somewhere in the deleted indent}.

				 *'autoread'* *'ar'* *'noautoread'* *'noar'*
'autoread' 'ar'		boolean	(default on)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	When a file has been detected to have been changed outside of Vim and
	it has not been changed inside of Vim, automatically read it again.
	When the file has been deleted this is not done.  |timestamp|
	If this option has a local value, use this command to switch back to
	using the global value: >
		:set autoread<
<
				 *'autowrite'* *'aw'* *'noautowrite'* *'noaw'*
'autowrite' 'aw'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Write the contents of the file, if it has been modified, on each
	:next, :rewind, :last, :first, :previous, :stop, :suspend, :tag, :!,
	:make, CTRL-] and CTRL-^ command; and when a :buffer, CTRL-O, CTRL-I,
	'{A-Z0-9}, or `{A-Z0-9} command takes one to another file.
	Note that for some commands the 'autowrite' option is not used, see
	'autowriteall' for that.

			 *'autowriteall'* *'awa'* *'noautowriteall'* *'noawa'*
'autowriteall' 'awa'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Like 'autowrite', but also used for commands ":edit", ":enew", ":quit",
	":qall", ":exit", ":xit", ":recover" and closing the Vim window.
	Setting this option also implies that Vim behaves like 'autowrite' has
	been set.

							*'background'* *'bg'*
'background' 'bg'	string	(default "dark" or "light", see below)
			global
	When set to "dark", Vim will try to use colors that look good on a
	dark background.  When set to "light", Vim will try to use colors that
	look good on a light background.  Any other value is illegal.
	Vim tries to set the default value according to the terminal used.
	This will not always be correct.
	Setting this option does not change the background color, it tells Vim
	what the background color looks like.  For changing the background
	color, see |:hi-normal|.

	When 'background' is set Vim will adjust the default color groups for
	the new value.  But the colors used for syntax highlighting will not
	change.					*g:colors_name*
	When a color scheme is loaded (the "g:colors_name" variable is set)
	setting 'background' will cause the color scheme to be reloaded.  If
	the color scheme adjusts to the value of 'background' this will work.
	However, if the color scheme sets 'background' itself the effect may
	be undone.  First delete the "g:colors_name" variable when needed.

	When setting 'background' to the default value with: >
		:set background&
<	Vim will guess the value.  In the GUI this should work correctly,
	in other cases Vim might not be able to guess the right value.

	When starting the GUI, the default value for 'background' will be
	"light".  When the value is not set in the gvimrc, and Vim detects
	that the background is actually quite dark, 'background' is set to
	"dark".  But this happens only AFTER the gvimrc file has been read
	(because the window needs to be opened to find the actual background
	color).  To get around this, force the GUI window to be opened by
	putting a ":gui" command in the gvimrc file, before where the value
	of 'background' is used (e.g., before ":syntax on").

	For Windows the default is "dark". "dark" should be used if $COLORFGBG
	suggests a dark	background (not yet implemented). Otherwise the default
	is "light".

	Normally this option would be set in the vimrc file.  Possibly
	depending on the terminal name.  Example: >
		:if $TERM == "xterm"
		:  set background=dark
		:endif
<	When this option is set, the default settings for the highlight groups
	will change.  To use other settings, place ":highlight" commands AFTER
	the setting of the 'background' option.
	This option is also used in the "$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim" file
	to select the colors for syntax highlighting.  After changing this
	option, you must load syntax.vim again to see the result.  This can be
	done with ":syntax on".

							*'backspace'* *'bs'*
'backspace' 'bs'	string	(default "indent,eol,start")
			global
	Influences the working of <BS>, <Del>, CTRL-W and CTRL-U in Insert
	mode.  This is a list of items, separated by commas.  Each item allows
	a way to backspace over something:
	value	effect	~
	indent	allow backspacing over autoindent
	eol	allow backspacing over line breaks (join lines)
	start	allow backspacing over the start of insert; CTRL-W and CTRL-U
		stop once at the start of insert.

	When the value is empty, Vi compatible backspacing is used.

	For backwards compatibility with version 5.4 and earlier:
	value	effect	~
	  0	same as ":set backspace=" (Vi compatible)
	  1	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol"
	  2	same as ":set backspace=indent,eol,start"

				*'backup'* *'bk'* *'nobackup'* *'nobk'*
'backup' 'bk'		boolean	(default off)
			global
	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  Leave it around after the
	file has been successfully written.  If you do not want to keep the
	backup file, but you do want a backup while the file is being
	written, reset this option and set the 'writebackup' option (this is
	the default).  If you do not want a backup file at all reset both
	options (use this if your file system is almost full).  See the
	|backup-table| for more explanations.
	When the 'backupskip' pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.
	When 'patchmode' is set, the backup may be renamed to become the
	oldest version of a file.

						*'backupcopy'* *'bkc'*
'backupcopy' 'bkc'	string	(Vi default for Unix: "yes", otherwise: "auto")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	When writing a file and a backup is made, this option tells how it's
	done.  This is a comma separated list of words.

	The main values are:
	"yes"	make a copy of the file and overwrite the original one
	"no"	rename the file and write a new one
	"auto"	one of the previous, what works best

	Extra values that can be combined with the ones above are:
	"breaksymlink"	always break symlinks when writing
	"breakhardlink"	always break hardlinks when writing

	Making a copy and overwriting the original file:
	- Takes extra time to copy the file.
	+ When the file has special attributes, is a (hard/symbolic) link or
	  has a resource fork, all this is preserved.
	- When the file is a link the backup will have the name of the link,
	  not of the real file.

	Renaming the file and writing a new one:
	+ It's fast.
	- Sometimes not all attributes of the file can be copied to the new
	  file.
	- When the file is a link the new file will not be a link.

	The "auto" value is the middle way: When Vim sees that renaming file
	is possible without side effects (the attributes can be passed on and
	the file is not a link) that is used.  When problems are expected, a
	copy will be made.

	The "breaksymlink" and "breakhardlink" values can be used in
	combination with any of "yes", "no" and "auto".  When included, they
	force Vim to always break either symbolic or hard links by doing
	exactly what the "no" option does, renaming the original file to
	become the backup and writing a new file in its place.  This can be
	useful for example in source trees where all the files are symbolic or
	hard links and any changes should stay in the local source tree, not
	be propagated back to the original source.
							*crontab*
	One situation where "no" and "auto" will cause problems: A program
	that opens a file, invokes Vim to edit that file, and then tests if
	the open file was changed (through the file descriptor) will check the
	backup file instead of the newly created file.  "crontab -e" is an
	example.

	When a copy is made, the original file is truncated and then filled
	with the new text.  This means that protection bits, owner and
	symbolic links of the original file are unmodified.  The backup file
	however, is a new file, owned by the user who edited the file.  The
	group of the backup is set to the group of the original file.  If this
	fails, the protection bits for the group are made the same as for
	others.

	When the file is renamed this is the other way around: The backup has
	the same attributes of the original file, and the newly written file
	is owned by the current user.  When the file was a (hard/symbolic)
	link, the new file will not!  That's why the "auto" value doesn't
	rename when the file is a link.  The owner and group of the newly
	written file will be set to the same ones as the original file, but
	the system may refuse to do this.  In that case the "auto" value will
	again not rename the file.

						*'backupdir'* *'bdir'*
'backupdir' 'bdir'	string	(default ".,$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/backup")
			global
	List of directories for the backup file, separated with commas.
	- The backup file will be created in the first directory in the list
	  where this is possible.  The directory must exist, Vim will not
	  create it for you.
	- Empty means that no backup file will be created ('patchmode' is
	  impossible!).  Writing may fail because of this.
	- A directory "." means to put the backup file in the same directory
	  as the edited file.
	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for Windows) means to
	  put the backup file relative to where the edited file is.  The
	  leading "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
	  ("." inside a directory name has no special meaning).
	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
	  name, precede it with a backslash.
	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
	- A directory name may end in an '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
	    :set bdir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
<	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
	  of the option is removed.
	See also 'backup' and 'writebackup' options.
	If you want to hide your backup files on Unix, consider this value: >
		:set backupdir=./.backup,~/.backup,.,/tmp
<	You must create a ".backup" directory in each directory and in your
	home directory for this to work properly.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'backupext'* *'bex'* *E589*
'backupext' 'bex'	string	(default "~")
			global
	String which is appended to a file name to make the name of the
	backup file.  The default is quite unusual, because this avoids
	accidentally overwriting existing files with a backup file.  You might
	prefer using ".bak", but make sure that you don't have files with
	".bak" that you want to keep.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

	If you like to keep a lot of backups, you could use a BufWritePre
	autocommand to change 'backupext' just before writing the file to
	include a timestamp. >
		:au BufWritePre * let &bex = '-' . strftime("%Y%b%d%X") . '~'
<	Use 'backupdir' to put the backup in a different directory.

						*'backupskip'* *'bsk'*
'backupskip' 'bsk'	string	(default: "/tmp/*,$TMPDIR/*,$TMP/*,$TEMP/*")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+wildignore|
			feature}
	A list of file patterns.  When one of the patterns matches with the
	name of the file which is written, no backup file is created.  Both
	the specified file name and the full path name of the file are used.
	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-patterns|.
	Watch out for special characters, see |option-backslash|.
	When $TMPDIR, $TMP or $TEMP is not defined, it is not used for the
	default value.  "/tmp/*" is only used for Unix.

	WARNING: Not having a backup file means that when Vim fails to write
	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only disable
	backups if you don't care about losing the file.

	Note that environment variables are not expanded.  If you want to use
	$HOME you must expand it explicitly, e.g.: >
		:let backupskip = escape(expand('$HOME'), '\') . '/tmp/*'

<	Note that the default also makes sure that "crontab -e" works (when a
	backup would be made by renaming the original file crontab won't see
	the newly created file).  Also see 'backupcopy' and |crontab|.

						*'balloondelay'* *'bdlay'*
'balloondelay' 'bdlay'	Removed. {Nvim}

			*'ballooneval'* *'beval'* *'noballooneval'* *'nobeval'*
'ballooneval' 'beval'	Removed. {Nvim}

						*'balloonexpr'* *'bexpr'*
'balloonexpr' 'bexpr'	Removed. {Nvim}

						*'belloff'* *'bo'*
'belloff' 'bo'		string	(default "")
			global
	Specifies for which events the bell will not be rung. It is a comma
	separated list of items. For each item that is present, the bell
	will be silenced. This is most useful to specify specific events in
	insert mode to be silenced.

	item	    meaning when present	~
	all	    All events.
	backspace   When hitting <BS> or <Del> and deleting results in an
		    error.
	cursor	    Fail to move around using the cursor keys or
		    <PageUp>/<PageDown> in |Insert-mode|.
	complete    Error occurred when using |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K| or
		    |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|.
	copy	    Cannot copy char from insert mode using |i_CTRL-Y| or
		    |i_CTRL-E|.
	ctrlg	    Unknown Char after <C-G> in Insert mode.
	error	    Other Error occurred (e.g. try to join last line)
		    (mostly used in |Normal-mode| or |Cmdline-mode|).
	esc	    hitting <Esc> in |Normal-mode|.
	ex	    In |Visual-mode|, hitting |Q| results in an error.
	hangul	    Error occurred when using hangul input.
	insertmode  Pressing <Esc> in 'insertmode'.
	lang	    Calling the beep module for Lua/Mzscheme/TCL.
	mess	    No output available for |g<|.
	showmatch   Error occurred for 'showmatch' function.
	operator    Empty region error |cpo-E|.
	register    Unknown register after <C-R> in |Insert-mode|.
	shell	    Bell from shell output |:!|.
	spell	    Error happened on spell suggest.
	wildmode    More matches in |cmdline-completion| available
		    (depends on the 'wildmode' setting).

	This is most useful, to fine tune when in insert mode the bell should
	be rung. For normal mode and ex commands, the bell is often rung to
	indicate that an error occurred. It can be silenced by adding the
	"error" keyword.

				     *'binary'* *'bin'* *'nobinary'* *'nobin'*
'binary' 'bin'		boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	This option should be set before editing a binary file.  You can also
	use the |-b| Vim argument.  When this option is switched on a few
	options will be changed (also when it already was on):
		'textwidth'  will be set to 0
		'wrapmargin' will be set to 0
		'modeline'   will be off
		'expandtab'  will be off
	Also, 'fileformat' and 'fileformats' options will not be used, the
	file is read and written like 'fileformat' was "unix" (a single <NL>
	separates lines).
	The 'fileencoding' and 'fileencodings' options will not be used, the
	file is read without conversion.
	NOTE: When you start editing a(nother) file while the 'bin' option is
	on, settings from autocommands may change the settings again (e.g.,
	'textwidth'), causing trouble when editing.  You might want to set
	'bin' again when the file has been loaded.
	The previous values of these options are remembered and restored when
	'bin' is switched from on to off.  Each buffer has its own set of
	saved option values.
	To edit a file with 'binary' set you can use the |++bin| argument.
	This avoids you have to do ":set bin", which would have effect for all
	files you edit.
	When writing a file the <EOL> for the last line is only written if
	there was one in the original file (normally Vim appends an <EOL> to
	the last line if there is none; this would make the file longer).  See
	the 'endofline' option.

							*'bomb'* *'nobomb'*
'bomb'			boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	When writing a file and the following conditions are met, a BOM (Byte
	Order Mark) is prepended to the file:
	- this option is on
	- the 'binary' option is off
	- 'fileencoding' is "utf-8", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" or one of the little/big
	  endian variants.
	Some applications use the BOM to recognize the encoding of the file.
	Often used for UCS-2 files on MS-Windows.  For other applications it
	causes trouble, for example: "cat file1 file2" makes the BOM of file2
	appear halfway through the resulting file.  Gcc doesn't accept a BOM.
	When Vim reads a file and 'fileencodings' starts with "ucs-bom", a
	check for the presence of the BOM is done and 'bomb' set accordingly.
	Unless 'binary' is set, it is removed from the first line, so that you
	don't see it when editing.  When you don't change the options, the BOM
	will be restored when writing the file.

						*'breakat'* *'brk'*
'breakat' 'brk'		string	(default " ^I!@*-+;:,./?")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	This option lets you choose which characters might cause a line
	break if 'linebreak' is on.  Only works for ASCII characters.

						*'breakindent'* *'bri'*
'breakindent' 'bri'	boolean (default off)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	Every wrapped line will continue visually indented (same amount of
	space as the beginning of that line), thus preserving horizontal blocks
	of text.

						*'breakindentopt'* *'briopt'*
'breakindentopt' 'briopt' string (default empty)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	Settings for 'breakindent'. It can consist of the following optional
	items and must be separated by a comma:
		min:{n}	    Minimum text width that will be kept after
			    applying 'breakindent', even if the resulting
			    text should normally be narrower. This prevents
			    text indented almost to the right window border
			    occupying lot of vertical space when broken.
		shift:{n}   After applying 'breakindent', the wrapped line's
			    beginning will be shifted by the given number of
			    characters.  It permits dynamic French paragraph
			    indentation (negative) or emphasizing the line
			    continuation (positive).
		sbr	    Display the 'showbreak' value before applying the 
			    additional indent.
	The default value for min is 20 and shift is 0.

						*'browsedir'* *'bsdir'*
'browsedir' 'bsdir'	string	(default: "last")
			global
			{only for Mac and Win32 GUI}
	Which directory to use for the file browser:
	   last		Use same directory as with last file browser, where a
			file was opened or saved.
	   buffer	Use the directory of the related buffer.
	   current	Use the current directory.
	   {path}	Use the specified directory

						*'bufhidden'* *'bh'*
'bufhidden' 'bh'	string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	This option specifies what happens when a buffer is no longer
	displayed in a window:
	  <empty>	follow the global 'hidden' option
	  hide		hide the buffer (don't unload it), also when 'hidden'
			is not set
	  unload	unload the buffer, also when 'hidden' is set or using
			|:hide|
	  delete	delete the buffer from the buffer list, also when
			'hidden' is set or using |:hide|, like using
			|:bdelete|
	  wipe		wipe out the buffer from the buffer list, also when
			'hidden' is set or using |:hide|, like using
			|:bwipeout|

	CAREFUL: when "unload", "delete" or "wipe" is used changes in a buffer
	are lost without a warning.  Also, these values may break autocommands
	that switch between buffers temporarily.
	This option is used together with 'buftype' and 'swapfile' to specify
	special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

			*'buflisted'* *'bl'* *'nobuflisted'* *'nobl'* *E85*
'buflisted' 'bl'	boolean (default: on)
			local to buffer
	When this option is set, the buffer shows up in the buffer list.  If
	it is reset it is not used for ":bnext", "ls", the Buffers menu, etc.
	This option is reset by Vim for buffers that are only used to remember
	a file name or marks.  Vim sets it when starting to edit a buffer.
	But not when moving to a buffer with ":buffer".

						*'buftype'* *'bt'* *E382*
'buftype' 'bt'		string (default: "")
			local to buffer
	The value of this option specifies the type of a buffer:
	  <empty>	normal buffer
	  acwrite	buffer will always be written with |BufWriteCmd|s
	  help		help buffer (do not set this manually)
	  nofile	buffer is not related to a file, will not be written
	  nowrite	buffer will not be written
	  quickfix	list of errors |:cwindow| or locations |:lwindow|
	  terminal	|terminal-emulator| buffer

	This option is used together with 'bufhidden' and 'swapfile' to
	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

	Be careful with changing this option, it can have many side effects!

	A "quickfix" buffer is only used for the error list and the location
	list.  This value is set by the |:cwindow| and |:lwindow| commands and
	you are not supposed to change it.

	"nofile" and "nowrite" buffers are similar:
	both:		The buffer is not to be written to disk, ":w" doesn't
			work (":w filename" does work though).
	both:		The buffer is never considered to be |'modified'|.
			There is no warning when the changes will be lost, for
			example when you quit Vim.
	both:		A swap file is only created when using too much memory
			(when 'swapfile' has been reset there is never a swap
			file).
	nofile only:	The buffer name is fixed, it is not handled like a
			file name.  It is not modified in response to a |:cd|
			command.
	both:		When using ":e bufname" and already editing "bufname"
			the buffer is made empty and autocommands are
			triggered as usual for |:edit|.
							*E676*
	"acwrite" implies that the buffer name is not related to a file, like
	"nofile", but it will be written.  Thus, in contrast to "nofile" and
	"nowrite", ":w" does work and a modified buffer can't be abandoned
	without saving.  For writing there must be matching |BufWriteCmd|,
	|FileWriteCmd| or |FileAppendCmd| autocommands.

						*'casemap'* *'cmp'*
'casemap' 'cmp'		string	(default: "internal,keepascii")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	Specifies details about changing the case of letters.  It may contain
	these words, separated by a comma:
	internal	Use internal case mapping functions, the current
			locale does not change the case mapping. When
			"internal" is omitted, the towupper() and towlower()
			system library functions are used when available.
	keepascii	For the ASCII characters (0x00 to 0x7f) use the US
			case mapping, the current locale is not effective.
			This probably only matters for Turkish.

						*'cdpath'* *'cd'* *E344* *E346*
'cdpath' 'cd'		string	(default: equivalent to $CDPATH or ",,")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+file_in_path| feature}
	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
	|:cd| and |:lcd| commands, provided that the directory being searched
	for has a relative path, not an absolute part starting with "/", "./"
	or "../", the 'cdpath' option is not used then.
	The 'cdpath' option's value has the same form and semantics as
	|'path'|.  Also see |file-searching|.
	The default value is taken from $CDPATH, with a "," prepended to look
	in the current directory first.
	If the default value taken from $CDPATH is not what you want, include
	a modified version of the following command in your vimrc file to
	override it: >
	  :let &cdpath = ',' . substitute(substitute($CDPATH, '[, ]', '\\\0', 'g'), ':', ',', 'g')
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
	(parts of 'cdpath' can be passed to the shell to expand file names).

						*'cedit'*
'cedit'			string	(Vim default: CTRL-F, Vi default: "")
			global
	The key used in Command-line Mode to open the command-line window.
	Only non-printable keys are allowed.
	The key can be specified as a single character, but it is difficult to
	type.  The preferred way is to use the <> notation.  Examples: >
		:set cedit=<C-Y>
		:set cedit=<Esc>
<	|Nvi| also has this option, but it only uses the first character.
	See |cmdwin|.

				*'charconvert'* *'ccv'* *E202* *E214* *E513*
'charconvert' 'ccv'	string (default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			and |+eval| features}
	An expression that is used for character encoding conversion.  It is
	evaluated when a file that is to be read or has been written has a
	different encoding from what is desired.
	'charconvert' is not used when the internal iconv() function is
	supported and is able to do the conversion.  Using iconv() is
	preferred, because it is much faster.
	'charconvert' is not used when reading stdin |--|, because there is no
	file to convert from.  You will have to save the text in a file first.
	The expression must return zero or an empty string for success,
	non-zero for failure.
	See |encoding-names| for possible encoding names.
	Additionally, names given in 'fileencodings' and 'fileencoding' are
	used.
	Conversion between "latin1", "unicode", "ucs-2", "ucs-4" and "utf-8"
	is done internally by Vim, 'charconvert' is not used for this.
	Also used for Unicode conversion.
	Example: >
		set charconvert=CharConvert()
		fun CharConvert()
		  system("recode "
			\ . v:charconvert_from . ".." . v:charconvert_to
			\ . " <" . v:fname_in . " >" v:fname_out)
		  return v:shell_error
		endfun
<	The related Vim variables are:
		v:charconvert_from	name of the current encoding
		v:charconvert_to	name of the desired encoding
		v:fname_in		name of the input file
		v:fname_out		name of the output file
	Note that v:fname_in and v:fname_out will never be the same.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

				   *'cindent'* *'cin'* *'nocindent'* *'nocin'*
'cindent' 'cin'		boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	Enables automatic C program indenting.  See 'cinkeys' to set the keys
	that trigger reindenting in insert mode and 'cinoptions' to set your
	preferred indent style.
	If 'indentexpr' is not empty, it overrules 'cindent'.
	If 'lisp' is not on and both 'indentexpr' and 'equalprg' are empty,
	the "=" operator indents using this algorithm rather than calling an
	external program.
	See |C-indenting|.
	When you don't like the way 'cindent' works, try the 'smartindent'
	option or 'indentexpr'.
	This option is not used when 'paste' is set.

							*'cinkeys'* *'cink'*
'cinkeys' 'cink'	string	(default "0{,0},0),:,0#,!^F,o,O,e")
			local to buffer
	A list of keys that, when typed in Insert mode, cause reindenting of
	the current line.  Only used if 'cindent' is on and 'indentexpr' is
	empty.
	For the format of this option see |cinkeys-format|.
	See |C-indenting|.

						*'cinoptions'* *'cino'*
'cinoptions' 'cino'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
	The 'cinoptions' affect the way 'cindent' reindents lines in a C
	program.  See |cinoptions-values| for the values of this option, and
	|C-indenting| for info on C indenting in general.


						*'cinwords'* *'cinw'*
'cinwords' 'cinw'	string	(default "if,else,while,do,for,switch")
			local to buffer
	These keywords start an extra indent in the next line when
	'smartindent' or 'cindent' is set.  For 'cindent' this is only done at
	an appropriate place (inside {}).
	Note that 'ignorecase' isn't used for 'cinwords'.  If case doesn't
	matter, include the keyword both the uppercase and lowercase:
	"if,If,IF".

						*'clipboard'* *'cb'*
'clipboard' 'cb'	string	(default "")
			global
	This option is a list of comma separated names.
	These names are recognized:

						*clipboard-unnamed*
	unnamed		When included, Vim will use the clipboard register '*'
			for all yank, delete, change and put operations which
			would normally go to the unnamed register.  When a
			register is explicitly specified, it will always be
			used regardless of whether "unnamed" is in 'clipboard'
			or not.  The clipboard register can always be
			explicitly accessed using the "* notation.  Also see
			|clipboard|.

						*clipboard-unnamedplus*
	unnamedplus	A variant of the "unnamed" flag which uses the
			clipboard register '+' (|quoteplus|) instead of
			register '*' for all yank, delete, change and put
			operations which would normally go to the unnamed
			register.  When "unnamed" is also included to the
			option, yank and delete operations (but not put)
			will additionally copy the text into register
			'*'. See |clipboard|.

						*clipboard-autoselect*
	autoselect	Works like the 'a' flag in 'guioptions': If present,
			then whenever Visual mode is started, or the Visual
			area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of the
			windowing system's global selection or put the
			selected text on the clipboard used by the selection
			register "*.  See |guioptions_a| and |quotestar| for
			details.  When the GUI is active, the 'a' flag in
			'guioptions' is used, when the GUI is not active, this
			"autoselect" flag is used.
			Also applies to the modeless selection.

						*clipboard-autoselectplus*
	autoselectplus  Like "autoselect" but using the + register instead of
			the * register.  Compare to the 'P' flag in
			'guioptions'.

						*clipboard-autoselectml*
	autoselectml	Like "autoselect", but for the modeless selection
			only.  Compare to the 'A' flag in 'guioptions'.

						*'cmdheight'* *'ch'*
'cmdheight' 'ch'	number	(default 1)
			global
	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line.  Helps avoiding
	|hit-enter| prompts.
	The value of this option is stored with the tab page, so that each tab
	page can have a different value.

						*'cmdwinheight'* *'cwh'*
'cmdwinheight' 'cwh'	number	(default 7)
			global
	Number of screen lines to use for the command-line window. |cmdwin|

						*'colorcolumn'* *'cc'*
'colorcolumn' 'cc'	string	(default "")
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	'colorcolumn' is a comma separated list of screen columns that are
	highlighted with ColorColumn |hl-ColorColumn|.  Useful to align
	text.  Will make screen redrawing slower.
	The screen column can be an absolute number, or a number preceded with
	'+' or '-', which is added to or subtracted from 'textwidth'. >

		:set cc=+1  " highlight column after 'textwidth'
		:set cc=+1,+2,+3  " highlight three columns after 'textwidth'
		:hi ColorColumn ctermbg=lightgrey guibg=lightgrey
<
	When 'textwidth' is zero then the items with '-' and '+' are not used.
	A maximum of 256 columns are highlighted.

						*'columns'* *'co'* *E594*
'columns' 'co'		number	(default 80 or terminal width)
			global
	Number of columns of the screen.  Normally this is set by the terminal
	initialization and does not have to be set by hand.
	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |ginit.vim| file.
	When you set this option and Vim is unable to change the physical
	number of columns of the display, the display may be messed up.  For
	the GUI it is always possible and Vim limits the number of columns to
	what fits on the screen.  You can use this command to get the widest
	window possible: >
		:set columns=9999
<	Minimum value is 12, maximum value is 10000.

					*'comments'* *'com'* *E524* *E525*
'comments' 'com'	string	(default
				"s1:/*,mb:*,ex:*/,://,b:#,:%,:XCOMM,n:>,fb:-")
			local to buffer
	A comma separated list of strings that can start a comment line.  See
	|format-comments|.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes to
	insert a space.

					*'commentstring'* *'cms'* *E537*
'commentstring' 'cms'	string	(default "/*%s*/")
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	A template for a comment.  The "%s" in the value is replaced with the
	comment text.  Currently only used to add markers for folding, see
	|fold-marker|.

						*'complete'* *'cpt'* *E535*
'complete' 'cpt'	string	(default: ".,w,b,u,t")
			local to buffer
	This option specifies how keyword completion |ins-completion| works
	when CTRL-P or CTRL-N are used.  It is also used for whole-line
	completion |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L|.  It indicates the type of completion
	and the places to scan.  It is a comma separated list of flags:
	.	scan the current buffer ('wrapscan' is ignored)
	w	scan buffers from other windows
	b	scan other loaded buffers that are in the buffer list
	u	scan the unloaded buffers that are in the buffer list
	U	scan the buffers that are not in the buffer list
	k	scan the files given with the 'dictionary' option
	kspell  use the currently active spell checking |spell|
	k{dict}	scan the file {dict}.  Several "k" flags can be given,
		patterns are valid too.  For example: >
			:set cpt=k/usr/dict/*,k~/spanish
<	s	scan the files given with the 'thesaurus' option
	s{tsr}	scan the file {tsr}.  Several "s" flags can be given, patterns
		are valid too.
	i	scan current and included files
	d	scan current and included files for defined name or macro
		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-D|
	]	tag completion
	t	same as "]"

	Unloaded buffers are not loaded, thus their autocmds |:autocmd| are
	not executed, this may lead to unexpected completions from some files
	(gzipped files for example).  Unloaded buffers are not scanned for
	whole-line completion.

	As you can see, CTRL-N and CTRL-P can be used to do any 'iskeyword'-
	based expansion (e.g., dictionary |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|, included patterns
	|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I|, tags |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-]| and normal expansions).

						*'completefunc'* *'cfu'*
'completefunc' 'cfu'	string	(default: empty)
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			or |+insert_expand| features}
	This option specifies a function to be used for Insert mode completion
	with CTRL-X CTRL-U. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|
	See |complete-functions| for an explanation of how the function is
	invoked and what it should return.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'completeopt'* *'cot'*
'completeopt' 'cot'	string	(default: "menu,preview")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+insert_expand| feature}
	A comma separated list of options for Insert mode completion
	|ins-completion|.  The supported values are:

	   menu	    Use a popup menu to show the possible completions.  The
		    menu is only shown when there is more than one match and
		    sufficient colors are available.  |ins-completion-menu|

	   menuone  Use the popup menu also when there is only one match.
		    Useful when there is additional information about the
		    match, e.g., what file it comes from.

	   longest  Only insert the longest common text of the matches.  If
		    the menu is displayed you can use CTRL-L to add more
		    characters.  Whether case is ignored depends on the kind
		    of completion.  For buffer text the 'ignorecase' option is
		    used.

	   preview  Show extra information about the currently selected
		    completion in the preview window.  Only works in
		    combination with "menu" or "menuone".

	  noinsert  Do not insert any text for a match until the user selects
		    a match from the menu. Only works in combination with
		    "menu" or "menuone". No effect if "longest" is present.

	  noselect  Do not select a match in the menu, force the user to
		    select one from the menu. Only works in combination with
		    "menu" or "menuone".


						*'concealcursor'* *'cocu'*
'concealcursor' 'cocu'	string (default: "")
			local to window
	Sets the modes in which text in the cursor line can also be concealed.
	When the current mode is listed then concealing happens just like in
	other lines.
	  n		Normal mode
	  v		Visual mode
	  i		Insert mode
	  c		Command line editing, for 'incsearch'

	'v' applies to all lines in the Visual area, not only the cursor.
	A useful value is "nc".  This is used in help files.  So long as you
	are moving around text is concealed, but when starting to insert text
	or selecting a Visual area the concealed text is displayed, so that
	you can see what you are doing.
	Keep in mind that the cursor position is not always where it's
	displayed.  E.g., when moving vertically it may change column.


'conceallevel' 'cole'		*'conceallevel'* *'cole'*
			number (default 0)
			local to window
	Determine how text with the "conceal" syntax attribute |:syn-conceal|
	is shown:

	Value		Effect ~
	0		Text is shown normally
	1		Each block of concealed text is replaced with one
			character.  If the syntax item does not have a custom
			replacement character defined (see |:syn-cchar|) the
			character defined in 'listchars' is used.
			It is highlighted with the "Conceal" highlight group.
	2		Concealed text is completely hidden unless it has a
			custom replacement character defined (see
			|:syn-cchar|).
	3		Concealed text is completely hidden.

	Note: in the cursor line concealed text is not hidden, so that you can
	edit and copy the text.  This can be changed with the 'concealcursor'
	option.

				*'confirm'* *'cf'* *'noconfirm'* *'nocf'*
'confirm' 'cf'		boolean (default off)
			global
	When 'confirm' is on, certain operations that would normally
	fail because of unsaved changes to a buffer, e.g. ":q" and ":e",
	instead raise a |dialog| asking if you wish to save the current
	file(s).  You can still use a ! to unconditionally |abandon| a buffer.
	If 'confirm' is off you can still activate confirmation for one
	command only (this is most useful in mappings) with the |:confirm|
	command.
	Also see the |confirm()| function and the 'v' flag in 'guioptions'.

			*'copyindent'* *'ci'* *'nocopyindent'* *'noci'*
'copyindent' 'ci'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	Copy the structure of the existing lines indent when autoindenting a
	new line.  Normally the new indent is reconstructed by a series of
	tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |'expandtab'| is enabled,
	in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option makes the
	new line copy whatever characters were used for indenting on the
	existing line.  'expandtab' has no effect on these characters, a Tab
	remains a Tab.  If the new indent is greater than on the existing
	line, the remaining space is filled in the normal manner.
	See 'preserveindent'.

						*'cpoptions'* *'cpo'* *cpo*
'cpoptions' 'cpo'	string	(Vim default: "aABceFs",
				 Vi default: all flags)
			global
	A sequence of single character flags.  When a character is present
	this indicates Vi-compatible behavior.  This is used for things where
	not being Vi-compatible is mostly or sometimes preferred.
	'cpoptions' stands for "compatible-options".
	Commas can be added for readability.
	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.

	    contains	behavior	~
								*cpo-a*
		a	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
			argument will set the alternate file name for the
			current window.
								*cpo-A*
		A	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
			argument will set the alternate file name for the
			current window.
								*cpo-b*
		b	"\|" in a ":map" command is recognized as the end of
			the map command.  The '\' is included in the mapping,
			the text after the '|' is interpreted as the next
			command.  Use a CTRL-V instead of a backslash to
			include the '|' in the mapping.  Applies to all
			mapping, abbreviation, menu and autocmd commands.
			See also |map_bar|.
								*cpo-B*
		B	A backslash has no special meaning in mappings,
			abbreviations and the "to" part of the menu commands.
			Remove this flag to be able to use a backslash like a
			CTRL-V.  For example, the command ":map X \<Esc>"
			results in X being mapped to:
				'B' included:	"\^["	 (^[ is a real <Esc>)
				'B' excluded:	"<Esc>"  (5 characters)
				('<' excluded in both cases)
								*cpo-c*
		c	Searching continues at the end of any match at the
			cursor position, but not further than the start of the
			next line.  When not present searching continues
			one character from the cursor position.  With 'c'
			"abababababab" only gets three matches when repeating
			"/abab", without 'c' there are five matches.
								*cpo-C*
		C	Do not concatenate sourced lines that start with a
			backslash.  See |line-continuation|.
								*cpo-d*
		d	Using "./" in the 'tags' option doesn't mean to use
			the tags file relative to the current file, but the
			tags file in the current directory.
								*cpo-D*
		D	Can't use CTRL-K to enter a digraph after Normal mode
			commands with a character argument, like |r|, |f| and
			|t|.
								*cpo-e*
		e	When executing a register with ":@r", always add a
			<CR> to the last line, also when the register is not
			linewise.  If this flag is not present, the register
			is not linewise and the last line does not end in a
			<CR>, then the last line is put on the command-line
			and can be edited before hitting <CR>.
								*cpo-E*
		E	It is an error when using "y", "d", "c", "g~", "gu" or
			"gU" on an Empty region.  The operators only work when
			at least one character is to be operate on.  Example:
			This makes "y0" fail in the first column.
								*cpo-f*
		f	When included, a ":read" command with a file name
			argument will set the file name for the current buffer,
			if the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet.
								*cpo-F*
		F	When included, a ":write" command with a file name
			argument will set the file name for the current
			buffer, if the current buffer doesn't have a file name
			yet.  Also see |cpo-P|.
								*cpo-i*
		i	When included, interrupting the reading of a file will
			leave it modified.
								*cpo-I*
		I	When moving the cursor up or down just after inserting
			indent for 'autoindent', do not delete the indent.
								*cpo-J*
		J	A |sentence| has to be followed by two spaces after
			the '.', '!' or '?'.  A <Tab> is not recognized as
			white space.
								*cpo-k*
		k	Disable the recognition of raw key codes in
			mappings, abbreviations, and the "to" part of menu
			commands.  For example, if <Key> sends ^[OA (where ^[
			is <Esc>), the command ":map X ^[OA" results in X
			being mapped to:
				'k' included:	"^[OA"	 (3 characters)
				'k' excluded:	"<Key>"  (one key code)
			Also see the '<' flag below.
								*cpo-K*
		K	Don't wait for a key code to complete when it is
			halfway through a mapping.  This breaks mapping
			<F1><F1> when only part of the second <F1> has been
			read.  It enables cancelling the mapping by typing
			<F1><Esc>.
								*cpo-l*
		l	Backslash in a [] range in a search pattern is taken
			literally, only "\]", "\^", "\-" and "\\" are special.
			See |/[]|
			   'l' included: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space>, '\' and 't'
			   'l' excluded: "/[ \t]"  finds <Space> and <Tab>
								*cpo-L*
		L	When the 'list' option is set, 'wrapmargin',
			'textwidth', 'softtabstop' and Virtual Replace mode
			(see |gR|) count a <Tab> as two characters, instead of
			the normal behavior of a <Tab>.
								*cpo-m*
		m	When included, a showmatch will always wait half a
			second.  When not included, a showmatch will wait half
			a second or until a character is typed.  |'showmatch'|
								*cpo-M*
		M	When excluded, "%" matching will take backslashes into
			account.  Thus in "( \( )" and "\( ( \)" the outer
			parenthesis match.  When included "%" ignores
			backslashes, which is Vi compatible.
								*cpo-n*
		n	When included, the column used for 'number' and
			'relativenumber' will also be used for text of wrapped
			lines.
								*cpo-o*
		o	Line offset to search command is not remembered for
			next search.
								*cpo-O*
		O	Don't complain if a file is being overwritten, even
			when it didn't exist when editing it.  This is a
			protection against a file unexpectedly created by
			someone else.  Vi didn't complain about this.
								*cpo-p*
		p	Vi compatible Lisp indenting.  When not present, a
			slightly better algorithm is used.
								*cpo-P*
		P	When included, a ":write" command that appends to a
			file will set the file name for the current buffer, if
			the current buffer doesn't have a file name yet and
			the 'F' flag is also included |cpo-F|.
								*cpo-q*
		q	When joining multiple lines leave the cursor at the
			position where it would be when joining two lines.
								*cpo-r*
		r	Redo ("." command) uses "/" to repeat a search
			command, instead of the actually used search string.
								*cpo-R*
		R	Remove marks from filtered lines.  Without this flag
			marks are kept like |:keepmarks| was used.
								*cpo-s*
		s	Set buffer options when entering the buffer for the
			first time.  This is like it is in Vim version 3.0.
			And it is the default.  If not present the options are
			set when the buffer is created.
								*cpo-S*
		S	Set buffer options always when entering a buffer
			(except 'readonly', 'fileformat', 'filetype' and
			'syntax').  This is the (most) Vi compatible setting.
			The options are set to the values in the current
			buffer.  When you change an option and go to another
			buffer, the value is copied.  Effectively makes the
			buffer options global to all buffers.

			's'    'S'     copy buffer options
			no     no      when buffer created
			yes    no      when buffer first entered (default)
			 X     yes     each time when buffer entered (vi comp.)
								*cpo-t*
		t	Search pattern for the tag command is remembered for
			"n" command.  Otherwise Vim only puts the pattern in
			the history for search pattern, but doesn't change the
			last used search pattern.
								*cpo-u*
		u	Undo is Vi compatible.  See |undo-two-ways|.
								*cpo-v*
		v	Backspaced characters remain visible on the screen in
			Insert mode.  Without this flag the characters are
			erased from the screen right away.  With this flag the
			screen newly typed text overwrites backspaced
			characters.
								*cpo-W*
		W	Don't overwrite a readonly file.  When omitted, ":w!"
			overwrites a readonly file, if possible.
								*cpo-x*
		x	<Esc> on the command-line executes the command-line.
			The default in Vim is to abandon the command-line,
			because <Esc> normally aborts a command.  |c_<Esc>|
								*cpo-X*
		X	When using a count with "R" the replaced text is
			deleted only once.  Also when repeating "R" with "."
			and a count.
								*cpo-y*
		y	A yank command can be redone with ".".
								*cpo-Z*
		Z	When using "w!" while the 'readonly' option is set,
			don't reset 'readonly'.
								*cpo-!*
		!	When redoing a filter command, use the last used
			external command, whatever it was.  Otherwise the last
			used -filter- command is used.
								*cpo-$*
		$	When making a change to one line, don't redisplay the
			line, but put a '$' at the end of the changed text.
			The changed text will be overwritten when you type the
			new text.  The line is redisplayed if you type any
			command that moves the cursor from the insertion
			point.
								*cpo-%*
		%	Vi-compatible matching is done for the "%" command.
			Does not recognize "#if", "#endif", etc.
			Does not recognize "/*" and "*/".
			Parens inside single and double quotes are also
			counted, causing a string that contains a paren to
			disturb the matching.  For example, in a line like
			"if (strcmp("foo(", s))" the first paren does not
			match the last one.  When this flag is not included,
			parens inside single and double quotes are treated
			specially.  When matching a paren outside of quotes,
			everything inside quotes is ignored.  When matching a
			paren inside quotes, it will find the matching one (if
			there is one).  This works very well for C programs.
			This flag is also used for other features, such as
			C-indenting.
								*cpo-+*
		+	When included, a ":write file" command will reset the
			'modified' flag of the buffer, even though the buffer
			itself may still be different from its file.
								*cpo-<*
		<	Disable the recognition of special key codes in |<>|
			form in mappings, abbreviations, and the "to" part of
			menu commands.  For example, the command
			":map X <Tab>" results in X being mapped to:
				'<' included:	"<Tab>"  (5 characters)
				'<' excluded:	"^I"	 (^I is a real <Tab>)
			Also see the 'k' flag above.
								*cpo->*
		>	When appending to a register, put a line break before
			the appended text.
								*cpo-;*
		;	When using |,| or |;| to repeat the last |t| search
			and the cursor is right in front of the searched
			character, the cursor won't move. When not included,
			the cursor would skip over it and jump to the
			following occurrence.

						*'cscopepathcomp'* *'cspc'*
'cscopepathcomp' 'cspc'	number	(default 0)
			global
	Determines how many components of the path to show in a list of tags.
	See |cscopepathcomp|.

						*'cscopeprg'* *'csprg'*
'cscopeprg' 'csprg'	string	(default "cscope")
			global
	Specifies the command to execute cscope.  See |cscopeprg|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'cscopequickfix'* *'csqf'*
'cscopequickfix' 'csqf' string	(default "")
			global
	Specifies whether to use quickfix window to show cscope results.
	See |cscopequickfix|.

		*'cscoperelative'* *'csre'* *'nocscoperelative'* *'nocsre'*
'cscoperelative' 'csre' boolean (default off)
			global
	In the absence of a prefix (-P) for cscope. setting this option enables
	to use the basename of cscope.out path as the prefix.
	See |cscoperelative|.

				*'cscopetag'* *'cst'* *'nocscopetag'* *'nocst'*
'cscopetag' 'cst'	boolean (default off)
			global
	Use cscope for tag commands.  See |cscope-options|.

						*'cscopetagorder'* *'csto'*
'cscopetagorder' 'csto'	number	(default 0)
			global
	Determines the order in which ":cstag" performs a search.  See
	|cscopetagorder|.

					*'cscopeverbose'* *'csverb'*
					*'nocscopeverbose'* *'nocsverb'*
'cscopeverbose' 'csverb' boolean (default off)
			global
	Give messages when adding a cscope database.  See |cscopeverbose|.

			*'cursorbind'* *'crb'* *'nocursorbind'* *'nocrb'*
'cursorbind' 'crb'	boolean  (default off)
			local to window
	When this option is set, as the cursor in the current
	window moves other cursorbound windows (windows that also have
	this option set) move their cursors to the corresponding line and
	column.  This option is useful for viewing the
	differences between two versions of a file (see 'diff'); in diff mode,
	inserted and deleted lines (though not characters within a line) are
	taken into account.


			*'cursorcolumn'* *'cuc'* *'nocursorcolumn'* *'nocuc'*
'cursorcolumn' 'cuc'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Highlight the screen column of the cursor with CursorColumn
	|hl-CursorColumn|.  Useful to align text.  Will make screen redrawing
	slower.
	If you only want the highlighting in the current window you can use
	these autocommands: >
		au WinLeave * set nocursorline nocursorcolumn
		au WinEnter * set cursorline cursorcolumn
<

			*'cursorline'* *'cul'* *'nocursorline'* *'nocul'*
'cursorline' 'cul'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Highlight the screen line of the cursor with CursorLine
	|hl-CursorLine|.  Useful to easily spot the cursor.  Will make screen
	redrawing slower.
	When Visual mode is active the highlighting isn't used to make it
	easier to see the selected text.


						*'debug'*
'debug'			string	(default "")
			global
	These values can be used:
	msg	Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given
		anyway.
	throw	Error messages that would otherwise be omitted will be given
		anyway and also throw an exception and set |v:errmsg|.
	beep	A message will be given when otherwise only a beep would be
		produced.
	The values can be combined, separated by a comma.
	"msg" and "throw" are useful for debugging 'foldexpr', 'formatexpr' or
	'indentexpr'.

						*'define'* *'def'*
'define' 'def'		string	(default "^\s*#\s*define")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	Pattern to be used to find a macro definition.  It is a search
	pattern, just like for the "/" command.  This option is used for the
	commands like "[i" and "[d" |include-search|.  The 'isident' option is
	used to recognize the defined name after the match:
		{match with 'define'}{non-ID chars}{defined name}{non-ID char}
	See |option-backslash| about inserting backslashes to include a space
	or backslash.
	The default value is for C programs.  For C++ this value would be
	useful, to include const type declarations: >
		^\(#\s*define\|[a-z]*\s*const\s*[a-z]*\)
<	When using the ":set" command, you need to double the backslashes!

			*'delcombine'* *'deco'* *'nodelcombine'* *'nodeco'*
'delcombine' 'deco'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	If editing Unicode and this option is set, backspace and Normal mode
	"x" delete each combining character on its own.  When it is off (the
	default) the character along with its combining characters are
	deleted.
	Note: When 'delcombine' is set "xx" may work different from "2x"!

	This is useful for Arabic, Hebrew and many other languages where one
	may have combining characters overtop of base characters, and want
	to remove only the combining ones.

						*'dictionary'* *'dict'*
'dictionary' 'dict'	string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
	for keyword completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|.  Each file should
	contain a list of words.  This can be one word per line, or several
	words per line, separated by non-keyword characters (white space is
	preferred).  Maximum line length is 510 bytes.
	When this option is empty, or an entry "spell" is present, spell
	checking is enabled the currently active spelling is used. |spell|
	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.
	This has nothing to do with the |Dictionary| variable type.
	Where to find a list of words?
	- On FreeBSD, there is the file "/usr/share/dict/words".
	- In the Simtel archive, look in the "msdos/linguist" directory.
	- In "miscfiles" of the GNU collection.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	Backticks cannot be used in this option for security reasons.

							*'diff'* *'nodiff'*
'diff'			boolean	(default off)
			local to window
	Join the current window in the group of windows that shows differences
	between files.  See |diff-mode|.

						*'dex'* *'diffexpr'*
'diffexpr' 'dex'	string	(default "")
			global
	Expression which is evaluated to obtain an ed-style diff file from two
	versions of a file.  See |diff-diffexpr|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'dip'* *'diffopt'*
'diffopt' 'dip'		string	(default "filler")
			global
	Option settings for diff mode.  It can consist of the following items.
	All are optional.  Items must be separated by a comma.

		filler		Show filler lines, to keep the text
				synchronized with a window that has inserted
				lines at the same position.  Mostly useful
				when windows are side-by-side and 'scrollbind'
				is set.

		context:{n}	Use a context of {n} lines between a change
				and a fold that contains unchanged lines.
				When omitted a context of six lines is used.
				See |fold-diff|.

		icase		Ignore changes in case of text.  "a" and "A"
				are considered the same.  Adds the "-i" flag
				to the "diff" command if 'diffexpr' is empty.

		iwhite		Ignore changes in amount of white space.  Adds
				the "-b" flag to the "diff" command if
				'diffexpr' is empty.  Check the documentation
				of the "diff" command for what this does
				exactly.  It should ignore adding trailing
				white space, but not leading white space.

		horizontal	Start diff mode with horizontal splits (unless
				explicitly specified otherwise).

		vertical	Start diff mode with vertical splits (unless
				explicitly specified otherwise).

		foldcolumn:{n}	Set the 'foldcolumn' option to {n} when
				starting diff mode.  Without this 2 is used.

	Examples: >

		:set diffopt=filler,context:4
		:set diffopt=
		:set diffopt=filler,foldcolumn:3
<
				     *'digraph'* *'dg'* *'nodigraph'* *'nodg'*
'digraph' 'dg'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+digraphs|
			feature}
	Enable the entering of digraphs in Insert mode with {char1} <BS>
	{char2}.  See |digraphs|.

						*'directory'* *'dir'*
'directory' 'dir'	string	(default "$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/swap//")
			global
	List of directory names for the swap file, separated with commas.
	- The swap file will be created in the first directory where this is
	  possible.  If it is not possible in any directory, but last 
	  directory listed in the option does not exist, it is created.
	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
	  impossible!).
	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for Windows) means to
	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//"
	  or "\\", the swap file name will be built from the complete path to
	  the file with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs.
	  This will ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
	  On Win32, when a separating comma is following, you must use "//",
	  since "\\" will include the comma in the file name.
	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
	  name, precede it with a backslash.
	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
	- A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
<	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
	  of the option is removed.
	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
	choice than "/tmp".  But it can contain a lot of files, your swap
	files get lost in the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your
	home directory is tried first.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

					*'display'* *'dy'*
'display' 'dy'		string	(default "lastline", Vi default: "")
			global
	Change the way text is displayed.  This is comma separated list of
	flags:
	lastline	When included, as much as possible of the last line
			in a window will be displayed.  "@@@" is put in the
			last columns of the last screen line to indicate the
			rest of the line is not displayed.
	truncate	Like "lastline", but "@@@" is displayed in the first
			column of the last screen line.  Overrules "lastline".
	uhex		Show unprintable characters hexadecimal as <xx>
			instead of using ^C and ~C.

	When neither "lastline" or "truncate" is included, a last line that
	doesn't fit is replaced with "@" lines.

						*'eadirection'* *'ead'*
'eadirection' 'ead'	string	(default "both")
			global
	Tells when the 'equalalways' option applies:
		ver	vertically, width of windows is not affected
		hor	horizontally, height of windows is not affected
		both	width and height of windows is affected

						*'emoji'* *'emo'*
'emoji' 'emo'	boolean (default: on)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	When on all Unicode emoji characters are considered to be full width.


					*'encoding'* *'enc'* *E543*
'encoding' 'enc'	Removed. |vim-differences| {Nvim}
	Nvim always uses UTF-8 internally. RPC communication
	(remote plugins/GUIs) must use UTF-8 strings.

	The character encoding of files can be different than UTF-8.
	This is specified with 'fileencoding'.  The conversion is done with
	iconv() or as specified with 'charconvert'.

			*'endofline'* *'eol'* *'noendofline'* *'noeol'*
'endofline' 'eol'	boolean	(default on)
			local to buffer
	When writing a file and this option is off and the 'binary' option
	is on, or 'fixeol' option is off, no <EOL> will be written for the
	last line in the file.  This option is automatically set or reset when
	starting to edit a new file, depending on whether file has an <EOL>
	for the last line in the file.  Normally you don't have to set or
	reset this option.
	When 'binary' is off and 'fixeol' is on the value is not used when
	writing the file.  When 'binary' is on or 'fixeol' is off it is used
	to remember the presence of a <EOL> for the last line in the file, so
	that when you write the file the situation from the original file can
	be kept.  But you can change it if you want to.

			     *'equalalways'* *'ea'* *'noequalalways'* *'noea'*
'equalalways' 'ea'	boolean	(default on)
			global
	When on, all the windows are automatically made the same size after
	splitting or closing a window.  This also happens the moment the
	option is switched on.  When off, splitting a window will reduce the
	size of the current window and leave the other windows the same.  When
	closing a window the extra lines are given to the window next to it
	(depending on 'splitbelow' and 'splitright').
	When mixing vertically and horizontally split windows, a minimal size
	is computed and some windows may be larger if there is room.  The
	'eadirection' option tells in which direction the size is affected.
	Changing the height and width of a window can be avoided by setting
	'winfixheight' and 'winfixwidth', respectively.
	If a window size is specified when creating a new window sizes are
	currently not equalized (it's complicated, but may be implemented in
	the future).

						*'equalprg'* *'ep'*
'equalprg' 'ep'		string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	External program to use for "=" command.  When this option is empty
	the internal formatting functions are used; either 'lisp', 'cindent'
	or 'indentexpr'.  When Vim was compiled without internal formatting,
	the "indent" program is used.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'errorbells'* *'eb'* *'noerrorbells'* *'noeb'*
'errorbells' 'eb'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Ring the bell (beep or screen flash) for error messages.  This only
	makes a difference for error messages, the bell will be used always
	for a lot of errors without a message (e.g., hitting <Esc> in Normal
	mode).  See 'visualbell' on how to make the bell behave like a beep,
	screen flash or do nothing. See 'belloff' to finetune when to ring the
	bell.

						*'errorfile'* *'ef'*
'errorfile' 'ef'	string	(default: "errors.err")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Name of the errorfile for the QuickFix mode (see |:cf|).
	When the "-q" command-line argument is used, 'errorfile' is set to the
	following argument.  See |-q|.
	NOT used for the ":make" command.  See 'makeef' for that.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'errorformat'* *'efm'*
'errorformat' 'efm'	string	(default is very long)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Scanf-like description of the format for the lines in the error file
	(see |errorformat|).

				     *'esckeys'* *'ek'* *'noesckeys'* *'noek'*
'esckeys' 'ek'		boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
	Function keys that start with an <Esc> are recognized in Insert
	mode.  When this option is off, the cursor and function keys cannot be
	used in Insert mode if they start with an <Esc>.  The advantage of
	this is that the single <Esc> is recognized immediately, instead of
	after one second.  Instead of resetting this option, you might want to
	try changing the values for 'timeoutlen' and 'ttimeoutlen'.  Note that
	when 'esckeys' is off, you can still map anything, but the cursor keys
	won't work by default.

						*'eventignore'* *'ei'*
'eventignore' 'ei'	string	(default "")
			global
	A list of autocommand event names, which are to be ignored.
	When set to "all" or when "all" is one of the items, all autocommand
	events are ignored, autocommands will not be executed.
	Otherwise this is a comma separated list of event names.  Example: >
	    :set ei=WinEnter,WinLeave
<
				 *'expandtab'* *'et'* *'noexpandtab'* *'noet'*
'expandtab' 'et'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	In Insert mode: Use the appropriate number of spaces to insert a
	<Tab>.  Spaces are used in indents with the '>' and '<' commands and
	when 'autoindent' is on.  To insert a real tab when 'expandtab' is
	on, use CTRL-V<Tab>.  See also |:retab| and |ins-expandtab|.
	This option is reset when the 'paste' option is set and restored when
	the 'paste' option is reset.

					*'exrc'* *'ex'* *'noexrc'* *'noex'*
'exrc' 'ex'		boolean (default off)
			global
	Enables the reading of .nvimrc and .exrc in the current directory.
	If you switch this option on you should also consider setting the
	'secure' option (see |initialization|).  Using this option comes
	with a potential security risk, use with care!
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
	Also see |init.vim| and |gui-init|.

				*'fileencoding'* *'fenc'* *E213*
'fileencoding' 'fenc'	string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	Sets the character encoding for the file of this buffer.

	When 'fileencoding' is different from "utf-8", conversion will be
	done when writing the file.  For reading see below.
	When 'fileencoding' is empty, the file will be saved with utf-8
	encoding.  (no conversion when reading or writing a file).
		WARNING: Conversion to a non-Unicode encoding can cause loss of
		information! 

	See |encoding-names| for the possible values.  Additionally, values may be
	specified that can be handled by the converter, see
	|mbyte-conversion|.

	When reading a file 'fileencoding' will be set from 'fileencodings'.
	To read a file in a certain encoding it won't work by setting
	'fileencoding', use the |++enc| argument.  One exception: when
	'fileencodings' is empty the value of 'fileencoding' is used.
	For a new file the global value of 'fileencoding' is used.

	Prepending "8bit-" and "2byte-" has no meaning here, they are ignored.
	When the option is set, the value is converted to lowercase.  Thus
	you can set it with uppercase values too.  '_' characters are
	replaced with '-'.  If a name is recognized from the list at
	|encoding-names|, it is replaced by the standard name.  For example
	"ISO8859-2" becomes "iso-8859-2".

	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the 'modified'
	option is set, because the file would be different when written.

	Keep in mind that changing 'fenc' from a modeline happens
	AFTER the text has been read, thus it applies to when the file will be
	written.  If you do set 'fenc' in a modeline, you might want to set
	'nomodified' to avoid not being able to ":q".

	This option can not be changed when 'modifiable' is off.

					*'fileencodings'* *'fencs'*
'fileencodings' 'fencs'	string (default: "ucs-bom,utf-8,default,latin1")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	This is a list of character encodings considered when starting to edit
	an existing file.  When a file is read, Vim tries to use the first
	mentioned character encoding.  If an error is detected, the next one
	in the list is tried.  When an encoding is found that works,
	'fileencoding' is set to it.  If all fail, 'fileencoding' is set to
	an empty string, which means that UTF-8 is used.
		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information! You can use
		the |++bad| argument to specify what is done with characters
		that can't be converted.
	For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
	will work and the first entry of 'fileencodings' will be used (except
	"ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
	another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
	preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
		au BufReadPost * if search('\S', 'w') == 0 |
			\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
<	This sets 'fileencoding' to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
	non-blank characters.
	When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of 'fileencodings' is
	not used.
	Note that 'fileencodings' is not used for a new file, the global value
	of 'fileencoding' is used instead.  You can set it with: >
		:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
<	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
	an empty file.
	The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
	(Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
	by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
	An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
	because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
	accepted.
	The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
	environment.  It is useful when your environment uses a non-latin1
	encoding, such as Russian.
	When a file contains an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence it won't be
	recognized as "utf-8".  You can use the |8g8| command to find the
	illegal byte sequence.
	WRONG VALUES:			WHAT'S WRONG:
		latin1,utf-8		"latin1" will always be used
		utf-8,ucs-bom,latin1	BOM won't be recognized in an utf-8
					file
		cp1250,latin1		"cp1250" will always be used
	If 'fileencodings' is empty, 'fileencoding' is not modified.
	See 'fileencoding' for the possible values.
	Setting this option does not have an effect until the next time a file
	is read.

					*'fileformat'* *'ff'*
'fileformat' 'ff'	string (Windows default: "dos",
				Unix default: "unix",
				Macintosh default: "mac")
			local to buffer
	This gives the <EOL> of the current buffer, which is used for
	reading/writing the buffer from/to a file:
	    dos	    <CR> <NL>
	    unix    <NL>
	    mac	    <CR>
	When "dos" is used, CTRL-Z at the end of a file is ignored.
	See |file-formats| and |file-read|.
	For the character encoding of the file see 'fileencoding'.
	When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformat' is ignored, file I/O
	works like it was set to "unix".
	This option is set automatically when starting to edit a file and
	'fileformats' is not empty and 'binary' is off.
	When this option is set, after starting to edit a file, the 'modified'
	option is set, because the file would be different when written.
	This option can not be changed when 'modifiable' is off.

					*'fileformats'* *'ffs'*
'fileformats' 'ffs'	string (default:
				Vim+Vi	Win32: "dos,unix",
				Vim	Unix: "unix,dos",
				Vim	Mac: "mac,unix,dos",
				Vi	others: "")
			global
	This gives the end-of-line (<EOL>) formats that will be tried when
	starting to edit a new buffer and when reading a file into an existing
	buffer:
	- When empty, the format defined with 'fileformat' will be used
	  always.  It is not set automatically.
	- When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
	  is opened.  'fileformat' is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
	  'fileformats' name will be used when a file is read into an existing
	  buffer, no matter what 'fileformat' for that buffer is set to.
	- When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
	  <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
	  edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
	  1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and 'fileformats' includes "dos",
	     'fileformat' is set to "dos".
	  2. If a <NL> is found and 'fileformats' includes "unix", 'fileformat'
	     is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
	     preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
	  3. If 'fileformat' has not yet been set, and if a <CR> is found, and
	     if 'fileformats' includes "mac", 'fileformat' is set to "mac".
	     This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
	      "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
	      "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.
	     Except: if "unix" was chosen, but there is a <CR> before
	     the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
	     the first few lines, "mac" is used.
	  4. If 'fileformat' is still not set, the first name from
	     'fileformats' is used.
	  When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
	  this happens like 'fileformat' has been set appropriately for that
	  file only, the option is not changed.
	When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformats' is not used.

	When Vim starts up with an empty buffer the first item is used.  You
	can overrule this by setting 'fileformat' in your .vimrc.

	For systems with a Dos-like <EOL> (<CR><NL>), when reading files that
	are ":source"ed and for vimrc files, automatic <EOL> detection may be
	done:
	- When 'fileformats' is empty, there is no automatic detection.  Dos
	  format will be used.
	- When 'fileformats' is set to one or more names, automatic detection
	  is done.  This is based on the first <NL> in the file: If there is a
	  <CR> in front of it, Dos format is used, otherwise Unix format is
	  used.
	Also see |file-formats|.

		*'fileignorecase'* *'fic'* *'nofileignorecase'* *'nofic'*
'fileignorecase' 'fic'	boolean	(default on for systems where case in file
				 names is normally ignored)
			global
	When set case is ignored when using file names and directories.
	See 'wildignorecase' for only ignoring case when doing completion.

					*'filetype'* *'ft'*
'filetype' 'ft'		string (default: "")
			local to buffer
	When this option is set, the FileType autocommand event is triggered.
	All autocommands that match with the value of this option will be
	executed.  Thus the value of 'filetype' is used in place of the file
	name.
	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current file type.
	This option is normally set when the file type is detected.  To enable
	this use the ":filetype on" command. |:filetype|
	Setting this option to a different value is most useful in a modeline,
	for a file for which the file type is not automatically recognized.
	Example, for in an IDL file:
		/* vim: set filetype=idl : */ ~
	|FileType| |filetypes|
	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
	names.  Example:
		/* vim: set filetype=c.doxygen : */ ~
	This will use the "c" filetype first, then the "doxygen" filetype.
	This works both for filetype plugins and for syntax files.  More than
	one dot may appear.
	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the 's' or
	'S' flag in 'cpoptions'.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

						*'fillchars'* *'fcs'*
'fillchars' 'fcs'	string	(default "vert:|,fold:-")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			and |+folding| features}
	Characters to fill the statuslines and vertical separators.
	It is a comma separated list of items:

	  item		default		Used for ~
	  stl:c		' ' or '^'	statusline of the current window
	  stlnc:c	' ' or '='	statusline of the non-current windows
	  vert:c	'|'		vertical separators |:vsplit|
	  fold:c	'-'		filling 'foldtext'
	  diff:c	'-'		deleted lines of the 'diff' option

	Any one that is omitted will fall back to the default.  For "stl" and
	"stlnc" the space will be used when there is highlighting, '^' or '='
	otherwise.

	Example: >
	    :set fillchars=stl:^,stlnc:=,vert:\|,fold:-,diff:-
<	This is similar to the default, except that these characters will also
	be used when there is highlighting.

	for "stl" and "stlnc" only single-byte values are supported.

	The highlighting used for these items:
	  item		highlight group ~
	  stl:c		StatusLine		|hl-StatusLine|
	  stlnc:c	StatusLineNC		|hl-StatusLineNC|
	  vert:c	VertSplit		|hl-VertSplit|
	  fold:c	Folded			|hl-Folded|
	  diff:c	DiffDelete		|hl-DiffDelete|

		*'fixendofline'* *'fixeol'* *'nofixendofline'* *'nofixeol'*
'fixendofline' 'fixeol'	boolean	(default on)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	When writing a file and this option is on, <EOL> at the end of file
	will be restored if missing. Turn this option off if you want to
	preserve the situation from the original file.
	When the 'binary' option is set the value of this option doesn't
	matter.
	See the 'endofline' option.

					*'fkmap'* *'fk'* *'nofkmap'* *'nofk'*
'fkmap' 'fk'		boolean (default off)			*E198*
			global
	When on, the keyboard is mapped for the Farsi character set.
	Normally you would set 'allowrevins' and use CTRL-_ in insert mode to
	toggle this option |i_CTRL-_|.  See |farsi.txt|.

						*'foldclose'* *'fcl'*
'foldclose' 'fcl'	string (default "")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	When set to "all", a fold is closed when the cursor isn't in it and
	its level is higher than 'foldlevel'.  Useful if you want folds to
	automatically close when moving out of them.

						*'foldcolumn'* *'fdc'*
'foldcolumn' 'fdc'	number (default 0)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	When non-zero, a column with the specified width is shown at the side
	of the window which indicates open and closed folds.  The maximum
	value is 12.
	See |folding|.

			*'foldenable'* *'fen'* *'nofoldenable'* *'nofen'*
'foldenable' 'fen'	boolean (default on)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	When off, all folds are open.  This option can be used to quickly
	switch between showing all text unfolded and viewing the text with
	folds (including manually opened or closed folds).  It can be toggled
	with the |zi| command.  The 'foldcolumn' will remain blank when
	'foldenable' is off.
	This option is set by commands that create a new fold or close a fold.
	See |folding|.

						*'foldexpr'* *'fde'*
'foldexpr' 'fde'	string (default: "0")
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			or |+eval| features}
	The expression used for when 'foldmethod' is "expr".  It is evaluated
	for each line to obtain its fold level.  See |fold-expr|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.
	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the 'diff' option is
	on.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'foldexpr' |textlock|.

						*'foldignore'* *'fdi'*
'foldignore' 'fdi'	string (default: "#")
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Used only when 'foldmethod' is "indent".  Lines starting with
	characters in 'foldignore' will get their fold level from surrounding
	lines.  White space is skipped before checking for this character.
	The default "#" works well for C programs.  See |fold-indent|.

						*'foldlevel'* *'fdl'*
'foldlevel' 'fdl'	number (default: 0)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets the fold level: Folds with a higher level will be closed.
	Setting this option to zero will close all folds.  Higher numbers will
	close fewer folds.
	This option is set by commands like |zm|, |zM| and |zR|.
	See |fold-foldlevel|.

						*'foldlevelstart'* *'fdls'*
'foldlevelstart' 'fdls'	number (default: -1)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets 'foldlevel' when starting to edit another buffer in a window.
	Useful to always start editing with all folds closed (value zero),
	some folds closed (one) or no folds closed (99).
	This is done before reading any modeline, thus a setting in a modeline
	overrules this option.  Starting to edit a file for |diff-mode| also
	ignores this option and closes all folds.
	It is also done before BufReadPre autocommands, to allow an autocmd to
	overrule the 'foldlevel' value for specific files.
	When the value is negative, it is not used.

						*'foldmarker'* *'fmr'* *E536*
'foldmarker' 'fmr'	string (default: "{{{,}}}")
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	The start and end marker used when 'foldmethod' is "marker".  There
	must be one comma, which separates the start and end marker.  The
	marker is a literal string (a regular expression would be too slow).
	See |fold-marker|.

						*'foldmethod'* *'fdm'*
'foldmethod' 'fdm'	string (default: "manual")
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	The kind of folding used for the current window.  Possible values:
	|fold-manual|	manual	    Folds are created manually.
	|fold-indent|	indent	    Lines with equal indent form a fold.
	|fold-expr|	expr	    'foldexpr' gives the fold level of a line.
	|fold-marker|	marker	    Markers are used to specify folds.
	|fold-syntax|	syntax	    Syntax highlighting items specify folds.
	|fold-diff|	diff	    Fold text that is not changed.

						*'foldminlines'* *'fml'*
'foldminlines' 'fml'	number (default: 1)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets the number of screen lines above which a fold can be displayed
	closed.  Also for manually closed folds.  With the default value of
	one a fold can only be closed if it takes up two or more screen lines.
	Set to zero to be able to close folds of just one screen line.
	Note that this only has an effect on what is displayed.  After using
	"zc" to close a fold, which is displayed open because it's smaller
	than 'foldminlines', a following "zc" may close a containing fold.

						*'foldnestmax'* *'fdn'*
'foldnestmax' 'fdn'	number (default: 20)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Sets the maximum nesting of folds for the "indent" and "syntax"
	methods.  This avoids that too many folds will be created.  Using more
	than 20 doesn't work, because the internal limit is 20.

						*'foldopen'* *'fdo'*
'foldopen' 'fdo'	string (default: "block,hor,mark,percent,quickfix,
							     search,tag,undo")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	Specifies for which type of commands folds will be opened, if the
	command moves the cursor into a closed fold.  It is a comma separated
	list of items.
	NOTE: When the command is part of a mapping this option is not used.
	Add the |zv| command to the mapping to get the same effect.
	(rationale: the mapping may want to control opening folds itself)

		item		commands ~
		all		any
		block		"(", "{", "[[", "[{", etc.
		hor		horizontal movements: "l", "w", "fx", etc.
		insert		any command in Insert mode
		jump		far jumps: "G", "gg", etc.
		mark		jumping to a mark: "'m", CTRL-O, etc.
		percent		"%"
		quickfix	":cn", ":crew", ":make", etc.
		search		search for a pattern: "/", "n", "*", "gd", etc.
				(not for a search pattern in a ":" command)
				Also for |[s| and |]s|.
		tag		jumping to a tag: ":ta", CTRL-T, etc.
		undo		undo or redo: "u" and CTRL-R
	When a movement command is used for an operator (e.g., "dl" or "y%")
	this option is not used.  This means the operator will include the
	whole closed fold.
	Note that vertical movements are not here, because it would make it
	very difficult to move onto a closed fold.
	In insert mode the folds containing the cursor will always be open
	when text is inserted.
	To close folds you can re-apply 'foldlevel' with the |zx| command or
	set the 'foldclose' option to "all".

						*'foldtext'* *'fdt'*
'foldtext' 'fdt'	string (default: "foldtext()")
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+folding|
			feature}
	An expression which is used to specify the text displayed for a closed
	fold.  See |fold-foldtext|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'foldtext' |textlock|.

					*'formatoptions'* *'fo'*
'formatoptions' 'fo'	string (default: "tcqj", Vi default: "vt")
			local to buffer
	This is a sequence of letters which describes how automatic
	formatting is to be done.  See |fo-table|.  When the 'paste' option is
	on, no formatting is done (like 'formatoptions' is empty).  Commas can
	be inserted for readability.
	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.

					*'formatlistpat'* *'flp'*
'formatlistpat' 'flp'	string (default: "^\s*\d\+[\]:.)}\t ]\s*")
			local to buffer
	A pattern that is used to recognize a list header.  This is used for
	the "n" flag in 'formatoptions'.
	The pattern must match exactly the text that will be the indent for
	the line below it.  You can use |/\ze| to mark the end of the match
	while still checking more characters.  There must be a character
	following the pattern, when it matches the whole line it is handled
	like there is no match.
	The default recognizes a number, followed by an optional punctuation
	character and white space.

						*'formatprg'* *'fp'*
'formatprg' 'fp'	string (default "")
			global
	The name of an external program that will be used to format the lines
	selected with the |gq| operator.  The program must take the input on
	stdin and produce the output on stdout.  The Unix program "fmt" is
	such a program.
	If the 'formatexpr' option is not empty it will be used instead.
	Otherwise, if 'formatprg' option is an empty string, the internal
	format function will be used |C-indenting|.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'formatexpr'* *'fex'*
'formatexpr' 'fex'	string (default "")
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			feature}
	Expression which is evaluated to format a range of lines for the |gq|
	operator or automatic formatting (see 'formatoptions').  When this
	option is empty 'formatprg' is used.

	The |v:lnum|  variable holds the first line to be formatted.
	The |v:count| variable holds the number of lines to be formatted.
	The |v:char|  variable holds the character that is going to be
		      inserted if the expression is being evaluated due to
		      automatic formatting.  This can be empty.  Don't insert
		      it yet!

	Example: >
		:set formatexpr=mylang#Format()
<	This will invoke the mylang#Format() function in the
	autoload/mylang.vim file in 'runtimepath'. |autoload|

	The expression is also evaluated when 'textwidth' is set and adding
	text beyond that limit.  This happens under the same conditions as
	when internal formatting is used.  Make sure the cursor is kept in the
	same spot relative to the text then!  The |mode()| function will
	return "i" or "R" in this situation.
	
	When the expression evaluates to non-zero Vim will fall back to using
	the internal format mechanism.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.  That stops the option from working,
	since changing the buffer text is not allowed.

						*'fsync'* *'fs'*
'fsync' 'fs'		boolean	(default on)
			global
	When on, the library function fsync() will be called after writing a
	file.  This will flush a file to disk, ensuring that it is safely
	written even on filesystems which do metadata-only journaling.  This
	will force the harddrive to spin up on Linux systems running in laptop
	mode, so it may be undesirable in some situations.  Be warned that
	turning this off increases the chances of data loss after a crash.

				   *'gdefault'* *'gd'* *'nogdefault'* *'nogd'*
'gdefault' 'gd'		boolean	(default off)
			global
	When on, the ":substitute" flag 'g' is default on.  This means that
	all matches in a line are substituted instead of one.  When a 'g' flag
	is given to a ":substitute" command, this will toggle the substitution
	of all or one match.  See |complex-change|.

		command		'gdefault' on	'gdefault' off	~
		:s///		  subst. all	  subst. one
		:s///g		  subst. one	  subst. all
		:s///gg		  subst. all	  subst. one

						*'grepformat'* *'gfm'*
'grepformat' 'gfm'	string	(default "%f:%l:%m,%f:%l%m,%f  %l%m")
			global
	Format to recognize for the ":grep" command output.
	This is a scanf-like string that uses the same format as the
	'errorformat' option: see |errorformat|.

						*'grepprg'* *'gp'*
'grepprg' 'gp'		string	(default "grep -n ",
					Unix: "grep -n $* /dev/null",
					Win32: "findstr /n" or "grep -n")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	Program to use for the |:grep| command.  This option may contain '%'
	and '#' characters, which are expanded like when used in a command-
	line.  The placeholder "$*" is allowed to specify where the arguments
	will be included.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See
	|option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	When your "grep" accepts the "-H" argument, use this to make ":grep"
	also work well with a single file: >
		:set grepprg=grep\ -nH
<	Special value: When 'grepprg' is set to "internal" the |:grep| command
	works like |:vimgrep|, |:lgrep| like |:lvimgrep|, |:grepadd| like
	|:vimgrepadd| and |:lgrepadd| like |:lvimgrepadd|.
	See also the section |:make_makeprg|, since most of the comments there
	apply equally to 'grepprg'.
	For Win32, the default is "findstr /n" if "findstr.exe" can be found,
	otherwise it's "grep -n".
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'guicursor'* *'gcr'* *E545* *E546* *E548* *E549*
'guicursor' 'gcr'	string	(default "n-v-c:block-Cursor/lCursor,
					ve:ver35-Cursor,
					o:hor50-Cursor,
					i-ci:ver25-Cursor/lCursor,
					r-cr:hor20-Cursor/lCursor,
					sm:block-Cursor
					-blinkwait175-blinkoff150-blinkon175",
				for Windows console:
					"n-v-c:block,o:hor50,i-ci:hor15,
					r-cr:hor30,sm:block")
			global
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled, and
			for Windows console}
	This option tells Vim what the cursor should look like in different
	modes.  It fully works in the GUI.  In a Windows console, only
	the height of the cursor can be changed.  This can be done by
	specifying a block cursor, or a percentage for a vertical or
	horizontal cursor.
	For a console the 't_SI' and 't_EI' escape sequences are used.

	The option is a comma separated list of parts.  Each part consist of a
	mode-list and an argument-list:
		mode-list:argument-list,mode-list:argument-list,..
	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		ve	Visual mode with 'selection' "exclusive" (same as 'v',
			if not specified)
		o	Operator-pending mode
		i	Insert mode
		r	Replace mode
		c	Command-line Normal (append) mode
		ci	Command-line Insert mode
		cr	Command-line Replace mode
		sm	showmatch in Insert mode
		a	all modes
	The argument-list is a dash separated list of these arguments:
		hor{N}	horizontal bar, {N} percent of the character height
		ver{N}	vertical bar, {N} percent of the character width
		block	block cursor, fills the whole character
			[only one of the above three should be present]
		blinkwait{N}				*cursor-blinking*
		blinkon{N}
		blinkoff{N}
			blink times for cursor: blinkwait is the delay before
			the cursor starts blinking, blinkon is the time that
			the cursor is shown and blinkoff is the time that the
			cursor is not shown.  The times are in msec.  When one
			of the numbers is zero, there is no blinking.  The
			default is: "blinkwait700-blinkon400-blinkoff250".
			These numbers are used for a missing entry.  This
			means that blinking is enabled by default.  To switch
			blinking off you can use "blinkon0".  The cursor only
			blinks when Vim is waiting for input, not while
			executing a command.
			To make the cursor blink in an xterm, see
			|xterm-blink|.
		{group-name}
			a highlight group name, that sets the color and font
			for the cursor
		{group-name}/{group-name}
			Two highlight group names, the first is used when
			no language mappings are used, the other when they
			are. |language-mapping|

	Examples of parts:
	   n-c-v:block-nCursor	in Normal, Command-line and Visual mode, use a
				block cursor with colors from the "nCursor"
				highlight group
	   i-ci:ver30-iCursor-blinkwait300-blinkon200-blinkoff150
				In Insert and Command-line Insert mode, use a
				30% vertical bar cursor with colors from the
				"iCursor" highlight group.  Blink a bit
				faster.

	The 'a' mode is different.  It will set the given argument-list for
	all modes.  It does not reset anything to defaults.  This can be used
	to do a common setting for all modes.  For example, to switch off
	blinking: "a:blinkon0"

	Examples of cursor highlighting: >
	    :highlight Cursor gui=reverse guifg=NONE guibg=NONE
	    :highlight Cursor gui=NONE guifg=bg guibg=fg
<
					*'guifont'* *'gfn'*
						   *E235* *E596*
'guifont' 'gfn'		string	(default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	This is a list of fonts which will be used for the GUI version of Vim.
	In its simplest form the value is just one font name.  When
	the font cannot be found you will get an error message.  To try other
	font names a list can be specified, font names separated with commas.
	The first valid font is used.

	On systems where 'guifontset' is supported (X11) and 'guifontset' is
	not empty, then 'guifont' is not used.

	Spaces after a comma are ignored.  To include a comma in a font name
	precede it with a backslash.  Setting an option requires an extra
	backslash before a space and a backslash.  See also
	|option-backslash|.  For example: >
	    :set guifont=Screen15,\ 7x13,font\\,with\\,commas
<	will make Vim try to use the font "Screen15" first, and if it fails it
	will try to use "7x13" and then "font,with,commas" instead.

	If none of the fonts can be loaded, Vim will keep the current setting.
	If an empty font list is given, Vim will try using other resource
	settings (for X, it will use the Vim.font resource), and finally it
	will try some builtin default which should always be there ("7x13" in
	the case of X).  The font names given should be "normal" fonts.  Vim
	will try to find the related bold and italic fonts.

	For Win32 and Mac OS: >
	    :set guifont=*
<	will bring up a font requester, where you can pick the font you want.

	The font name depends on the GUI used.  See |setting-guifont| for a
	way to set 'guifont' for various systems.

	For Mac OSX you can use something like this: >
	    :set guifont=Monaco:h10
<								*E236*
	Note that the fonts must be mono-spaced (all characters have the same
	width).

	To preview a font on X11, you might be able to use the "xfontsel"
	program.  The "xlsfonts" program gives a list of all available fonts.

	For the Win32 GUI					*E244* *E245*
	- takes these options in the font name:
		hXX - height is XX (points, can be floating-point)
		wXX - width is XX (points, can be floating-point)
		b   - bold
		i   - italic
		u   - underline
		s   - strikeout
		cXX - character set XX.  Valid charsets are: ANSI, ARABIC,
		      BALTIC, CHINESEBIG5, DEFAULT, EASTEUROPE, GB2312, GREEK,
		      HANGEUL, HEBREW, JOHAB, MAC, OEM, RUSSIAN, SHIFTJIS,
		      SYMBOL, THAI, TURKISH, VIETNAMESE ANSI and BALTIC.
		      Normally you would use "cDEFAULT".

	  Use a ':' to separate the options.
	- A '_' can be used in the place of a space, so you don't need to use
	  backslashes to escape the spaces.
	- Examples: >
	    :set guifont=courier_new:h12:w5:b:cRUSSIAN
	    :set guifont=Andale_Mono:h7.5:w4.5
<

					*'guifontset'* *'gfs'*
					*E250* *E252* *E234* *E597* *E598*
'guifontset' 'gfs'	string	(default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled and
			with the |+xfontset| feature}
	When not empty, specifies two (or more) fonts to be used.  The first
	one for normal English, the second one for your special language.  See
	|xfontset|.
	Setting this option also means that all font names will be handled as
	a fontset name.  Also the ones used for the "font" argument of the
	|:highlight| command.
	The fonts must match with the current locale.  If fonts for the
	character sets that the current locale uses are not included, setting
	'guifontset' will fail.
	Note the difference between 'guifont' and 'guifontset': In 'guifont'
	the comma-separated names are alternative names, one of which will be
	used.  In 'guifontset' the whole string is one fontset name,
	including the commas.  It is not possible to specify alternative
	fontset names.
	This example works on many X11 systems: >
		:set guifontset=-*-*-medium-r-normal--16-*-*-*-c-*-*-*
<
				*'guifontwide'* *'gfw'* *E231* *E533* *E534*
'guifontwide' 'gfw'	string	(default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	When not empty, specifies a comma-separated list of fonts to be used
	for double-width characters.  The first font that can be loaded is
	used.
	Note: The size of these fonts must be exactly twice as wide as the one
	specified with 'guifont' and the same height.

	'guifontwide' is only used when 'guifontset' is empty or invalid.
	When 'guifont' is set and a valid font is found in it and
	'guifontwide' is empty Vim will attempt to find a matching
	double-width font and set 'guifontwide' to it.

	Windows +multibyte only:		*guifontwide_win_mbyte*

	If set and valid, 'guifontwide' is used for IME instead of 'guifont'.

						*'guiheadroom'* *'ghr'*
'guiheadroom' 'ghr'	number	(default 50)
			global
			{only for X11 GUI}
	The number of pixels subtracted from the screen height when fitting
	the GUI window on the screen.  Set this before the GUI is started,
	e.g., in your |gvimrc| file.  When zero, the whole screen height will
	be used by the window.  When positive, the specified number of pixel
	lines will be left for window decorations and other items on the
	screen.  Set it to a negative value to allow windows taller than the
	screen.

						*'guioptions'* *'go'*
'guioptions' 'go'	string	(default "egmrLT"   (MS-Windows))
			global
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled}
	This option only has an effect in the GUI version of Vim.  It is a
	sequence of letters which describes what components and options of the
	GUI should be used.
	To avoid problems with flags that are added in the future, use the
	"+=" and "-=" feature of ":set" |add-option-flags|.

	Valid letters are as follows:
							*guioptions_a* *'go-a'*
	  'a'	Autoselect:  If present, then whenever VISUAL mode is started,
		or the Visual area extended, Vim tries to become the owner of
		the windowing system's global selection.  This means that the
		Visually highlighted text is available for pasting into other
		applications as well as into Vim itself.  When the Visual mode
		ends, possibly due to an operation on the text, or when an
		application wants to paste the selection, the highlighted text
		is automatically yanked into the "* selection register.
		Thus the selection is still available for pasting into other
		applications after the VISUAL mode has ended.
		    If not present, then Vim won't become the owner of the
		windowing system's global selection unless explicitly told to
		by a yank or delete operation for the "* register.
		The same applies to the modeless selection.
								*'go-P'*
	  'P'	Like autoselect but using the "+ register instead of the "*
		register.
								*'go-A'*
	  'A'	Autoselect for the modeless selection.  Like 'a', but only
		applies to the modeless selection.

		    'guioptions'   autoselect Visual  autoselect modeless ~
			 ""		 -			 -
			 "a"		yes			yes
			 "A"		 -			yes
			 "aA"		yes			yes

								*'go-c'*
	  'c'	Use console dialogs instead of popup dialogs for simple
		choices.
								*'go-e'*
	  'e'	Add tab pages when indicated with 'showtabline'.
		'guitablabel' can be used to change the text in the labels.
		When 'e' is missing a non-GUI tab pages line may be used.
		The GUI tabs are only supported on some systems, currently
		Mac OS/X and MS-Windows.
								*'go-i'*
	  'i'	Use a Vim icon.
								*'go-m'*
	  'm'	Menu bar is present.
								*'go-M'*
	  'M'	The system menu "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim" is not sourced.  Note
		that this flag must be added in the vimrc file, before
		switching on syntax or filetype recognition (when the |gvimrc|
		file is sourced the system menu has already been loaded; the
		":syntax on" and ":filetype on" commands load the menu too).
								*'go-g'*
	  'g'	Grey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.  If
		'g' is not included inactive menu items are not shown at all.
								*'go-T'*
	  'T'	Include Toolbar.  Currently only in Win32 GUI.
								*'go-r'*
	  'r'	Right-hand scrollbar is always present.
								*'go-R'*
	  'R'	Right-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
		split window.
								*'go-l'*
	  'l'	Left-hand scrollbar is always present.
								*'go-L'*
	  'L'	Left-hand scrollbar is present when there is a vertically
		split window.
								*'go-b'*
	  'b'	Bottom (horizontal) scrollbar is present.  Its size depends on
		the longest visible line, or on the cursor line if the 'h'
		flag is included. |gui-horiz-scroll|
								*'go-h'*
	  'h'	Limit horizontal scrollbar size to the length of the cursor
		line.  Reduces computations. |gui-horiz-scroll|

	And yes, you may even have scrollbars on the left AND the right if
	you really want to :-).  See |gui-scrollbars| for more information.

								*'go-v'*
	  'v'	Use a vertical button layout for dialogs.  When not included,
		a horizontal layout is preferred, but when it doesn't fit a
		vertical layout is used anyway.
								*'go-p'*
	  'p'	Use Pointer callbacks for X11 GUI.  This is required for some
		window managers.  If the cursor is not blinking or hollow at
		the right moment, try adding this flag.  This must be done
		before starting the GUI.  Set it in your |gvimrc|.  Adding or
		removing it after the GUI has started has no effect.


						*'guitablabel'* *'gtl'*
'guitablabel' 'gtl'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled and
			with the |+windows| feature}
	When nonempty describes the text to use in a label of the GUI tab
	pages line.  When empty and when the result is empty Vim will use a
	default label.  See |setting-guitablabel| for more info.

	The format of this option is like that of 'statusline'.
	'guitabtooltip' is used for the tooltip, see below.

	Only used when the GUI tab pages line is displayed.  'e' must be
	present in 'guioptions'.  For the non-GUI tab pages line 'tabline' is
	used.

						*'guitabtooltip'* *'gtt'*
'guitabtooltip' 'gtt'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{only available when compiled with GUI enabled and
			with the |+windows| feature}
	When nonempty describes the text to use in a tooltip for the GUI tab
	pages line.  When empty Vim will use a default tooltip.
	This option is otherwise just like 'guitablabel' above.
	You can include a line break.  Simplest method is to use |:let|: >
		:let &guitabtooltip = "line one\nline two"
<

						*'helpfile'* *'hf'*
'helpfile' 'hf'		string	(default (MSDOS)  "$VIMRUNTIME\doc\help.txt"
					 (others) "$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt")
			global
	Name of the main help file.  All distributed help files should be
	placed together in one directory.  Additionally, all "doc" directories
	in 'runtimepath' will be used.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  For example:
	"$VIMRUNTIME/doc/help.txt".  If $VIMRUNTIME is not set, $VIM is also
	tried.  Also see |$VIMRUNTIME| and |option-backslash| about including
	spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'helpheight'* *'hh'*
'helpheight' 'hh'	number	(default 20)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Minimal initial height of the help window when it is opened with the
	":help" command.  The initial height of the help window is half of the
	current window, or (when the 'ea' option is on) the same as other
	windows.  When the height is less than 'helpheight', the height is
	set to 'helpheight'.  Set to zero to disable.

						*'helplang'* *'hlg'*
'helplang' 'hlg'	string	(default: messages language or empty)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_lang|
			feature}
	Comma separated list of languages.  Vim will use the first language
	for which the desired help can be found.  The English help will always
	be used as a last resort.  You can add "en" to prefer English over
	another language, but that will only find tags that exist in that
	language and not in the English help.
	Example: >
		:set helplang=de,it
<	This will first search German, then Italian and finally English help
	files.
	When using |CTRL-]| and ":help!" in a non-English help file Vim will
	try to find the tag in the current language before using this option.
	See |help-translated|.

				     *'hidden'* *'hid'* *'nohidden'* *'nohid'*
'hidden' 'hid'		boolean	(default off)
			global
	When off a buffer is unloaded when it is |abandon|ed.  When on a
	buffer becomes hidden when it is |abandon|ed.  If the buffer is still
	displayed in another window, it does not become hidden, of course.
	The commands that move through the buffer list sometimes make a buffer
	hidden although the 'hidden' option is off: When the buffer is
	modified, 'autowrite' is off or writing is not possible, and the '!'
	flag was used.  See also |windows.txt|.
	To only make one buffer hidden use the 'bufhidden' option.
	This option is set for one command with ":hide {command}" |:hide|.
	WARNING: It's easy to forget that you have changes in hidden buffers.
	Think twice when using ":q!" or ":qa!".

						*'highlight'* *'hl'*
'highlight' 'hl'	string	(default (as a single string):
				     "8:SpecialKey,~:EndOfBuffer,z:TermCursor,
				     Z:TermCursorNC,@:NonText,d:Directory,
				     e:ErrorMsg,i:IncSearch,l:Search,
				     m:MoreMsg,M:ModeMsg,n:LineNr,
				     N:CursorLineNr,r:Question,s:StatusLine,
				     S:StatusLineNC,c:VertSplit,t:Title,
				     v:Visual,w:WarningMsg,W:WildMenu,
				     f:Folded,F:FoldColumn,A:DiffAdd,
				     C:DiffChange,D:DiffDelete,T:DiffText,
				     >:SignColumn,B:SpellBad,P:SpellCap,
				     R:SpellRare,L:SpellLocal,-:Conceal,
				     +:Pmenu,=:PmenuSel,x:PmenuSbar,
				     X:PmenuThumb")
			global
	This option can be used to set highlighting mode for various
	occasions.  It is a comma separated list of character pairs.  The
	first character in a pair gives the occasion, the second the mode to
	use for that occasion.  The occasions are:
	|hl-SpecialKey|	 8  Meta and special keys listed with ":map"
	|hl-EndOfBuffer|      ~ lines after the last line in the buffer
	|hl-TermCursor|	 z  Cursor in a focused terminal
	|hl-TermCursorNC| Z Cursor in an unfocused terminal
	|hl-NonText|	 @  '@' at the end of the window and
			    characters from 'showbreak'
	|hl-Directory|	 d  directories in CTRL-D listing and other special
			    things in listings
	|hl-ErrorMsg|	 e  error messages
	|hl-IncSearch|	 i  'incsearch' highlighting
	|hl-Search|	 l  last search pattern highlighting (see 'hlsearch')
	|hl-MoreMsg|	 m  |more-prompt|
	|hl-ModeMsg|	 M  Mode (e.g., "-- INSERT --")
	|hl-LineNr|	 n  line number for ":number" and ":#" commands, and
			    when 'number' or 'relativenumber' option is set.
	|hl-CursorLineNr| N like n for when 'cursorline' or 'relativenumber' is
			    set.
	|hl-Question|	 r  |hit-enter| prompt and yes/no questions
	|hl-StatusLine|	 s  status line of current window |status-line|
	|hl-StatusLineNC| S  status lines of not-current windows
	|hl-Title|	 t  Titles for output from ":set all", ":autocmd" etc.
	|hl-VertSplit|	 c  column used to separate vertically split windows
	|hl-Visual|	 v  Visual mode
	|hl-WarningMsg|	 w  warning messages
	|hl-WildMenu|	 W  wildcard matches displayed for 'wildmenu'
	|hl-Folded|	 f  line used for closed folds
	|hl-FoldColumn|	 F  'foldcolumn'
	|hl-DiffAdd|	 A  added line in diff mode
	|hl-DiffChange|	 C  changed line in diff mode
	|hl-DiffDelete|	 D  deleted line in diff mode
	|hl-DiffText|	 T  inserted text in diff mode
	|hl-SignColumn|	 >  column used for |signs|
	|hl-SpellBad|	 B  misspelled word |spell|
	|hl-SpellCap|	 P  word that should start with capital |spell|
	|hl-SpellRare|	 R  rare word |spell|
	|hl-SpellLocal|	 L  word from other region |spell|
	|hl-Conceal|	 -  the placeholders used for concealed characters
			    (see 'conceallevel')
	|hl-Pmenu|       +  popup menu normal line
	|hl-PmenuSel|    =  popup menu normal line
	|hl-PmenuSbar|   x  popup menu scrollbar
	|hl-PmenuThumb|  X  popup menu scrollbar thumb

	The display modes are:
		r	reverse		(termcap entry "mr" and "me")
		i	italic		(termcap entry "ZH" and "ZR")
		b	bold		(termcap entry "md" and "me")
		s	standout	(termcap entry "so" and "se")
		u	underline	(termcap entry "us" and "ue")
		c	undercurl	(termcap entry "Cs" and "Ce")
		n	no highlighting
		-	no highlighting
		:	use a highlight group
	The default is used for occasions that are not included.
	When using the ':' display mode, this must be followed by the name of
	a highlight group.  A highlight group can be used to define any type
	of highlighting, including using color.  See |:highlight| on how to
	define one.  The default uses a different group for each occasion.
	See |highlight-default| for the default highlight groups.

				 *'hlsearch'* *'hls'* *'nohlsearch'* *'nohls'*
'hlsearch' 'hls'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+extra_search| feature}
	When there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its matches.
	The type of highlighting used can be set with the 'l' occasion in the
	'highlight' option.  This uses the "Search" highlight group by
	default.  Note that only the matching text is highlighted, any offsets
	are not applied.
	See also: 'incsearch' and |:match|.
	When you get bored looking at the highlighted matches, you can turn it
	off with |:nohlsearch|.  This does not change the option value, as
	soon as you use a search command, the highlighting comes back.
	'redrawtime' specifies the maximum time spent on finding matches.
	When the search pattern can match an end-of-line, Vim will try to
	highlight all of the matched text.  However, this depends on where the
	search starts.  This will be the first line in the window or the first
	line below a closed fold.  A match in a previous line which is not
	drawn may not continue in a newly drawn line.
	You can specify whether the highlight status is restored on startup
	with the 'h' flag in 'shada' |shada-h|.

						*'history'* *'hi'*
'history' 'hi'		number	(Vim default: 10000, Vi default: 0)
			global
	A history of ":" commands, and a history of previous search patterns
	is remembered.  This option decides how many entries may be stored in
	each of these histories (see |cmdline-editing|).
	The maximum value is 10000.

					 *'hkmap'* *'hk'* *'nohkmap'* *'nohk'*
'hkmap' 'hk'		boolean (default off)
			global
	When on, the keyboard is mapped for the Hebrew character set.
	Normally you would set 'allowrevins' and use CTRL-_ in insert mode to
	toggle this option.  See |rileft.txt|.

				 *'hkmapp'* *'hkp'* *'nohkmapp'* *'nohkp'*
'hkmapp' 'hkp'		boolean (default off)
			global
	When on, phonetic keyboard mapping is used.  'hkmap' must also be on.
	This is useful if you have a non-Hebrew keyboard.
	See |rileft.txt|.

						*'icon'* *'noicon'*
'icon'			boolean	(default off, on when title can be restored)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When on, the icon text of the window will be set to the value of
	'iconstring' (if it is not empty), or to the name of the file
	currently being edited.  Only the last part of the name is used.
	Overridden by the 'iconstring' option.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icons.

						*'iconstring'*
'iconstring'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When this option is not empty, it will be used for the icon text of
	the window.  This happens only when the 'icon' option is on.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window icon text
	When this option contains printf-style '%' items, they will be
	expanded according to the rules used for 'statusline'.  See
	'titlestring' for example settings.
	{not available when compiled without the |+statusline| feature}

			*'ignorecase'* *'ic'* *'noignorecase'* *'noic'*
'ignorecase' 'ic'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Ignore case in search patterns.  Also used when searching in the tags
	file.
	Also see 'smartcase' and 'tagcase'.
	Can be overruled by using "\c" or "\C" in the pattern, see
	|/ignorecase|.

				*'imcmdline'* *'imc'* *'noimcmdline'* *'noimc'*
'imcmdline' 'imc'	boolean (default off)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+xim|,
			|+multi_byte_ime| or |global-ime| features}
	When set the Input Method is always on when starting to edit a command
	line, unless entering a search pattern (see 'imsearch' for that).
	Setting this option is useful when your input method allows entering
	English characters directly, e.g., when it's used to type accented
	characters with dead keys.

				*'imdisable'* *'imd'* *'noimdisable'* *'noimd'*
'imdisable' 'imd'	boolean (default off, on for some systems (SGI))
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+xim|,
			|+multi_byte_ime| or |global-ime| features}
	When set the Input Method is never used.  This is useful to disable
	the IM when it doesn't work properly.
	Currently this option is on by default for SGI/IRIX machines.  This
	may change in later releases.

						*'iminsert'* *'imi'*
'iminsert' 'imi'	number (default 0, 2 when an input method is supported)
			local to buffer
	Specifies whether :lmap or an Input Method (IM) is to be used in
	Insert mode.  Valid values:
		0	:lmap is off and IM is off
		1	:lmap is ON and IM is off
		2	:lmap is off and IM is ON
	2 is available only when compiled with the |+multi_byte_ime|, |+xim|
	or |global-ime|.
	To always reset the option to zero when leaving Insert mode with <Esc>
	this can be used: >
		:inoremap <ESC> <ESC>:set iminsert=0<CR>
<	This makes :lmap and IM turn off automatically when leaving Insert
	mode.
	Note that this option changes when using CTRL-^ in Insert mode
	|i_CTRL-^|.
	The value is set to 1 when setting 'keymap' to a valid keymap name.
	It is also used for the argument of commands like "r" and "f".

						*'imsearch'* *'ims'*
'imsearch' 'ims'	number (default 0, 2 when an input method is supported)
			local to buffer
	Specifies whether :lmap or an Input Method (IM) is to be used when
	entering a search pattern.  Valid values:
		-1	the value of 'iminsert' is used, makes it look like
			'iminsert' is also used when typing a search pattern
		0	:lmap is off and IM is off
		1	:lmap is ON and IM is off
		2	:lmap is off and IM is ON
	Note that this option changes when using CTRL-^ in Command-line mode
	|c_CTRL-^|.
	The value is set to 1 when it is not -1 and setting the 'keymap'
	option to a valid keymap name.

						*'inccommand'* *'icm'*
'inccommand' 'icm'	string	(default "")
			global
			
	"nosplit": Shows the effects of a command incrementally, as you type.
	"split"	 : Also shows partial off-screen results in a preview window.

	Works for |:substitute|, |:smagic|, |:snomagic|. |hl-Substitute|

	If the preview is too slow (exceeds 'redrawtime') then 'inccommand' is
	automatically disabled until |Command-line-mode| is done.

						*'include'* *'inc'*
'include' 'inc'		string	(default "^\s*#\s*include")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+find_in_path| feature}
	Pattern to be used to find an include command.  It is a search
	pattern, just like for the "/" command (See |pattern|).  The default
	value is for C programs.  This option is used for the commands "[i",
	"]I", "[d", etc.
	Normally the 'isfname' option is used to recognize the file name that
	comes after the matched pattern.  But if "\zs" appears in the pattern
	then the text matched from "\zs" to the end, or until "\ze" if it
	appears, is used as the file name.  Use this to include characters
	that are not in 'isfname', such as a space.  You can then use
	'includeexpr' to process the matched text.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

						*'includeexpr'* *'inex'*
'includeexpr' 'inex'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+find_in_path| or |+eval| features}
	Expression to be used to transform the string found with the 'include'
	option to a file name.  Mostly useful to change "." to "/" for Java: >
		:set includeexpr=substitute(v:fname,'\\.','/','g')
<	The "v:fname" variable will be set to the file name that was detected.

	Also used for the |gf| command if an unmodified file name can't be
	found.  Allows doing "gf" on the name after an 'include' statement.
	Also used for |<cfile>|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'includeexpr' |textlock|.

				 *'incsearch'* *'is'* *'noincsearch'* *'nois'*
'incsearch' 'is'	boolean	(default on)
			global
	While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed
	so far, matches.  The matched string is highlighted.  If the pattern
	is invalid or not found, nothing is shown.  The screen will be updated
	often, this is only useful on fast terminals.
	Note that the match will be shown, but the cursor will return to its
	original position when no match is found and when pressing <Esc>.  You
	still need to finish the search command with <Enter> to move the
	cursor to the match.
	Vim only searches for about half a second.  With a complicated
	pattern and/or a lot of text the match may not be found.  This is to
	avoid that Vim hangs while you are typing the pattern.
	The highlighting can be set with the 'i' flag in 'highlight'.
	See also: 'hlsearch'.
	CTRL-L can be used to add one character from after the current match
	to the command line.  If 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' are set and the
	command line has no uppercase characters, the added character is
	converted to lowercase.
	CTRL-R CTRL-W can be used to add the word at the end of the current
	match, excluding the characters that were already typed.

						*'indentexpr'* *'inde'*
'indentexpr' 'inde'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
	Expression which is evaluated to obtain the proper indent for a line.
	It is used when a new line is created, for the |=| operator and
	in Insert mode as specified with the 'indentkeys' option.
	When this option is not empty, it overrules the 'cindent' and
	'smartindent' indenting.  When 'lisp' is set, this option is
	overridden by the Lisp indentation algorithm.
	When 'paste' is set this option is not used for indenting.
	The expression is evaluated with |v:lnum| set to the line number for
	which the indent is to be computed.  The cursor is also in this line
	when the expression is evaluated (but it may be moved around).
	The expression must return the number of spaces worth of indent.  It
	can return "-1" to keep the current indent (this means 'autoindent' is
	used for the indent).
	Functions useful for computing the indent are |indent()|, |cindent()|
	and |lispindent()|.
	The evaluation of the expression must not have side effects!  It must
	not change the text, jump to another window, etc.  Afterwards the
	cursor position is always restored, thus the cursor may be moved.
	Normally this option would be set to call a function: >
		:set indentexpr=GetMyIndent()
<	Error messages will be suppressed, unless the 'debug' option contains
	"msg".
	See |indent-expression|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'indentexpr' |textlock|.


						*'indentkeys'* *'indk'*
'indentkeys' 'indk'	string	(default "0{,0},:,0#,!^F,o,O,e")
			local to buffer
	A list of keys that, when typed in Insert mode, cause reindenting of
	the current line.  Only happens if 'indentexpr' isn't empty.
	The format is identical to 'cinkeys', see |indentkeys-format|.
	See |C-indenting| and |indent-expression|.

			*'infercase'* *'inf'* *'noinfercase'* *'noinf'*
'infercase' 'inf'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	When doing keyword completion in insert mode |ins-completion|, and
	'ignorecase' is also on, the case of the match is adjusted depending
	on the typed text.  If the typed text contains a lowercase letter
	where the match has an upper case letter, the completed part is made
	lowercase.  If the typed text has no lowercase letters and the match
	has a lowercase letter where the typed text has an uppercase letter,
	and there is a letter before it, the completed part is made uppercase.
	With 'noinfercase' the match is used as-is.

			*'insertmode'* *'im'* *'noinsertmode'* *'noim'*
'insertmode' 'im'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Makes Vim work in a way that Insert mode is the default mode.  Useful
	if you want to use Vim as a modeless editor.
	These Insert mode commands will be useful:
	- Use the cursor keys to move around.
	- Use CTRL-O to execute one Normal mode command |i_CTRL-O|).  When
	  this is a mapping, it is executed as if 'insertmode' was off.
	  Normal mode remains active until the mapping is finished.
	- Use CTRL-L to execute a number of Normal mode commands, then use
	  <Esc> to get back to Insert mode.  Note that CTRL-L moves the cursor
	  left, like <Esc> does when 'insertmode' isn't set.  |i_CTRL-L|

	These items change when 'insertmode' is set:
	- when starting to edit of a file, Vim goes to Insert mode.
	- <Esc> in Insert mode is a no-op and beeps.
	- <Esc> in Normal mode makes Vim go to Insert mode.
	- CTRL-L in Insert mode is a command, it is not inserted.
	- CTRL-Z in Insert mode suspends Vim, see |CTRL-Z|.	*i_CTRL-Z*
	However, when <Esc> is used inside a mapping, it behaves like
	'insertmode' was not set.  This was done to be able to use the same
	mappings with 'insertmode' set or not set.
	When executing commands with |:normal| 'insertmode' is not used.

						*'isfname'* *'isf'*
'isfname' 'isf'		string	(default for Windows:
			     "@,48-57,/,\,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,{,},[,],:,@-@,!,~,="
			    otherwise: "@,48-57,/,.,-,_,+,,,#,$,%,~,=")
			global
	The characters specified by this option are included in file names and
	path names.  Filenames are used for commands like "gf", "[i" and in
	the tags file.  It is also used for "\f" in a |pattern|.
	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.
	For UTF-8 the characters 0xa0 to 0xff are included as well.
	Think twice before adding white space to this option.  Although a
	space may appear inside a file name, the effect will be that Vim
	doesn't know where a file name starts or ends when doing completion.
	It most likely works better without a space in 'isfname'.

	Note that on systems using a backslash as path separator, Vim tries to
	do its best to make it work as you would expect.  That is a bit
	tricky, since Vi originally used the backslash to escape special
	characters.  Vim will not remove a backslash in front of a normal file
	name character on these systems, but it will on Unix and alikes.  The
	'&' and '^' are not included by default, because these are special for
	cmd.exe.

	The format of this option is a list of parts, separated with commas.
	Each part can be a single character number or a range.  A range is two
	character numbers with '-' in between.  A character number can be a
	decimal number between 0 and 255 or the ASCII character itself (does
	not work for digits).  Example:
		"_,-,128-140,#-43"	(include '_' and '-' and the range
					128 to 140 and '#' to 43)
	If a part starts with '^', the following character number or range
	will be excluded from the option.  The option is interpreted from left
	to right.  Put the excluded character after the range where it is
	included.  To include '^' itself use it as the last character of the
	option or the end of a range.  Example:
		"^a-z,#,^"	(exclude 'a' to 'z', include '#' and '^')
	If the character is '@', all characters where isalpha() returns TRUE
	are included.  Normally these are the characters a to z and A to Z,
	plus accented characters.  To include '@' itself use "@-@".  Examples:
		"@,^a-z"	All alphabetic characters, excluding lower
				case ASCII letters.
		"a-z,A-Z,@-@"	All letters plus the '@' character.
	A comma can be included by using it where a character number is
	expected.  Example:
		"48-57,,,_"	Digits, comma and underscore.
	A comma can be excluded by prepending a '^'.  Example:
		" -~,^,,9"	All characters from space to '~', excluding
				comma, plus <Tab>.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.

						*'isident'* *'isi'*
'isident' 'isi'		string	(default for Windows:
					   "@,48-57,_,128-167,224-235"
				otherwise: "@,48-57,_,192-255")
			global
	The characters given by this option are included in identifiers.
	Identifiers are used in recognizing environment variables and after a
	match of the 'define' option.  It is also used for "\i" in a
	|pattern|.  See 'isfname' for a description of the format of this
	option.
	Careful: If you change this option, it might break expanding
	environment variables.  E.g., when '/' is included and Vim tries to
	expand "$HOME/.local/share/nvim/shada/main.shada".  Maybe you should 
	change 'iskeyword' instead.

						*'iskeyword'* *'isk'*
'iskeyword' 'isk'	string (default: @,48-57,_,192-255
				Vi default: @,48-57,_)
			local to buffer
	Keywords are used in searching and recognizing with many commands:
	"w", "*", "[i", etc.  It is also used for "\k" in a |pattern|.  See
	'isfname' for a description of the format of this option.  For C
	programs you could use "a-z,A-Z,48-57,_,.,-,>".
	For a help file it is set to all non-blank printable characters except
	'*', '"' and '|' (so that CTRL-] on a command finds the help for that
	command).
	When the 'lisp' option is on the '-' character is always included.
	This option also influences syntax highlighting, unless the syntax
	uses |:syn-iskeyword|.

						*'isprint'* *'isp'*
'isprint' 'isp'	string	(default: "@,161-255")
			global
	The characters given by this option are displayed directly on the
	screen.  It is also used for "\p" in a |pattern|.  The characters from
	space (ASCII 32) to '~' (ASCII 126) are always displayed directly,
	even when they are not included in 'isprint' or excluded.  See
	'isfname' for a description of the format of this option.

	Non-printable characters are displayed with two characters:
		  0 -  31	"^@" - "^_"
		 32 - 126	always single characters
		   127		"^?"
		128 - 159	"~@" - "~_"
		160 - 254	"| " - "|~"
		   255		"~?"
	Illegal bytes from 128 to 255 (invalid UTF-8) are
	displayed as <xx>, with the hexadecimal value of the byte.
	When 'display' contains "uhex" all unprintable characters are
	displayed as <xx>.
	The SpecialKey highlighting will be used for unprintable characters.
	|hl-SpecialKey|

	Multi-byte characters 256 and above are always included, only the
	characters up to 255 are specified with this option.  When a character
	is printable but it is not available in the current font, a
	replacement character will be shown.
	Unprintable and zero-width Unicode characters are displayed as <xxxx>.
	There is no option to specify these characters.

			*'joinspaces'* *'js'* *'nojoinspaces'* *'nojs'*
'joinspaces' 'js'	boolean	(default on)
			global
	Insert two spaces after a '.', '?' and '!' with a join command.
	Otherwise only one space is inserted.

					*'keymap'* *'kmp'* *E544*
'keymap' 'kmp'		string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{only available when compiled with the |+keymap|
			feature}
	Name of a keyboard mapping.  See |mbyte-keymap|.
	Setting this option to a valid keymap name has the side effect of
	setting 'iminsert' to one, so that the keymap becomes effective.
	'imsearch' is also set to one, unless it was -1
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

					*'keymodel'* *'km'*
'keymodel' 'km'		string	(default "")
			global
	List of comma separated words, which enable special things that keys
	can do.  These values can be used:
	   startsel	Using a shifted special key starts selection (either
			Select mode or Visual mode, depending on "key" being
			present in 'selectmode').
	   stopsel	Using a not-shifted special key stops selection.
	Special keys in this context are the cursor keys, <End>, <Home>,
	<PageUp> and <PageDown>.
	The 'keymodel' option is set by the |:behave| command.

					*'keywordprg'* *'kp'*
'keywordprg' 'kp'	string	(default ":Man", Windows: ":help")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	Program to use for the |K| command.  Environment variables are
	expanded |:set_env|.  ":help" may be used to access the Vim internal
	help.  (Note that previously setting the global option to the empty
	value did this, which is now deprecated.)
	When the first character is ":", the command is invoked as a Vim
	command prefixed with [count]. {Nvim}
	When "man" or "man -s" is used, Vim will automatically translate
	a [count] for the "K" command to a section number.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	Example: >
		:set keywordprg=man\ -s
		:set keywordprg=:Man
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

					*'langmap'* *'lmap'* *E357* *E358*
'langmap' 'lmap'	string	(default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+langmap|
			feature}
	This option allows switching your keyboard into a special language
	mode.  When you are typing text in Insert mode the characters are
	inserted directly.  When in Normal mode the 'langmap' option takes
	care of translating these special characters to the original meaning
	of the key.  This means you don't have to change the keyboard mode to
	be able to execute Normal mode commands.
	This is the opposite of the 'keymap' option, where characters are
	mapped in Insert mode.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

	Example (for Greek, in UTF-8):				*greek*  >
	    :set langmap=A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,QQ,R,S,T,U,V,WW,X,Y,Z,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,qq,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z
<	Example (exchanges meaning of z and y for commands): >
	    :set langmap=zy,yz,ZY,YZ
<
	The 'langmap' option is a list of parts, separated with commas.  Each
	part can be in one of two forms:
	1.  A list of pairs.  Each pair is a "from" character immediately
	    followed by the "to" character.  Examples: "aA", "aAbBcC".
	2.  A list of "from" characters, a semi-colon and a list of "to"
	    characters.  Example: "abc;ABC"
	Example: "aA,fgh;FGH,cCdDeE"
	Special characters need to be preceded with a backslash.  These are
	";", ',' and backslash itself.

	This will allow you to activate vim actions without having to switch
	back and forth between the languages.  Your language characters will
	be understood as normal vim English characters (according to the
	langmap mappings) in the following cases:
	 o Normal/Visual mode (commands, buffer/register names, user mappings)
	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Register names after CTRL-R
	 o Insert/Replace Mode: Mappings
	Characters entered in Command-line mode will NOT be affected by
	this option.   Note that this option can be changed at any time
	allowing to switch between mappings for different languages/encodings.
	Use a mapping to avoid having to type it each time!

					*'langmenu'* *'lm'*
'langmenu' 'lm'		string	(default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+menu| and
			|+multi_lang| features}
	Language to use for menu translation.  Tells which file is loaded
	from the "lang" directory in 'runtimepath': >
		"lang/menu_" . &langmenu . ".vim"
<	(without the spaces).  For example, to always use the Dutch menus, no
	matter what $LANG is set to: >
		:set langmenu=nl_NL.ISO_8859-1
<	When 'langmenu' is empty, |v:lang| is used.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.
	If your $LANG is set to a non-English language but you do want to use
	the English menus: >
		:set langmenu=none
<	This option must be set before loading menus, switching on filetype
	detection or syntax highlighting.  Once the menus are defined setting
	this option has no effect.  But you could do this: >
		:source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
		:set langmenu=de_DE.ISO_8859-1
		:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
<	Warning: This deletes all menus that you defined yourself!

					*'langnoremap'* *'lnr'*
'langnoremap' 'lnr'	boolean (default on)
			global
	When on, setting 'langmap' does not apply to characters resulting from
	a mapping.  If setting 'langmap' disables some of your mappings, make
	sure this option is set.

					*'laststatus'* *'ls'*
'laststatus' 'ls'	number	(default 2)
			global
	The value of this option influences when the last window will have a
	status line:
		0: never
		1: only if there are at least two windows
		2: always
	The screen looks nicer with a status line if you have several
	windows, but it takes another screen line. |status-line|

			*'lazyredraw'* *'lz'* *'nolazyredraw'* *'nolz'*
'lazyredraw' 'lz'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	When this option is set, the screen will not be redrawn while
	executing macros, registers and other commands that have not been
	typed.  Also, updating the window title is postponed.  To force an
	update use |:redraw|.

			*'linebreak'* *'lbr'* *'nolinebreak'* *'nolbr'*
'linebreak' 'lbr'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	If on, Vim will wrap long lines at a character in 'breakat' rather
	than at the last character that fits on the screen.  Unlike
	'wrapmargin' and 'textwidth', this does not insert <EOL>s in the file,
	it only affects the way the file is displayed, not its contents.
	If 'breakindent' is set, line is visually indented. Then, the value
	of 'showbreak' is used to put in front of wrapped lines. This option
	is not used when the 'wrap' option is off.
	Note that <Tab> characters after an <EOL> are mostly not displayed
	with the right amount of white space.

						*'lines'* *E593*
'lines'			number	(default 24 or terminal height)
			global
	Number of lines of the Vim window.
	Normally you don't need to set this.  It is done automatically by the
	terminal initialization code.
	When Vim is running in the GUI or in a resizable window, setting this
	option will cause the window size to be changed.  When you only want
	to use the size for the GUI, put the command in your |gvimrc| file.
	Vim limits the number of lines to what fits on the screen.  You can
	use this command to get the tallest window possible: >
		:set lines=999
<	Minimum value is 2, maximum value is 1000.
	If you get less lines than expected, check the 'guiheadroom' option.
	When you set this option and Vim is unable to change the physical
	number of lines of the display, the display may be messed up.

						*'linespace'* *'lsp'*
'linespace' 'lsp'	number	(default 0, 1 for Win32 GUI)
			global
			{only in the GUI}
	Number of pixel lines inserted between characters.  Useful if the font
	uses the full character cell height, making lines touch each other.
	When non-zero there is room for underlining.
	With some fonts there can be too much room between lines (to have
	space for ascents and descents).  Then it makes sense to set
	'linespace' to a negative value.  This may cause display problems
	though!

						*'lisp'* *'nolisp'*
'lisp'			boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+lispindent|
			feature}
	Lisp mode: When <Enter> is typed in insert mode set the indent for
	the next line to Lisp standards (well, sort of).  Also happens with
	"cc" or "S".  'autoindent' must also be on for this to work.  The 'p'
	flag in 'cpoptions' changes the method of indenting: Vi compatible or
	better.  Also see 'lispwords'.
	The '-' character is included in keyword characters.  Redefines the
	"=" operator to use this same indentation algorithm rather than
	calling an external program if 'equalprg' is empty.
	This option is not used when 'paste' is set.

						*'lispwords'* *'lw'*
'lispwords' 'lw'	string	(default is very long)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not available when compiled without the |+lispindent|
			feature}
	Comma separated list of words that influence the Lisp indenting.
	|'lisp'|

						*'list'* *'nolist'*
'list'			boolean	(default off)
			local to window
	List mode: Show tabs as CTRL-I is displayed, display $ after end of
	line.  Useful to see the difference between tabs and spaces and for
	trailing blanks.  Further changed by the 'listchars' option.

	The cursor is displayed at the start of the space a Tab character
	occupies, not at the end as usual in Normal mode.  To get this cursor
	position while displaying Tabs with spaces, use: >
		:set list lcs=tab:\ \ 
<
	Note that list mode will also affect formatting (set with 'textwidth'
	or 'wrapmargin') when 'cpoptions' includes 'L'.  See 'listchars' for
	changing the way tabs are displayed.

						*'listchars'* *'lcs'*
'listchars' 'lcs'	string	(default: "tab:> ,trail:-,nbsp:+"
				 Vi default: "eol:$")
			global
	Strings to use in 'list' mode and for the |:list| command.  It is a
	comma separated list of string settings.

							*lcs-eol*
	  eol:c		Character to show at the end of each line.  When
			omitted, there is no extra character at the end of the
			line.
							*lcs-tab*
	  tab:xy	Two characters to be used to show a tab.  The first
			char is used once.  The second char is repeated to
			fill the space that the tab normally occupies.
			"tab:>-" will show a tab that takes four spaces as
			">---".  When omitted, a tab is show as ^I.
							*lcs-space*
	  space:c	Character to show for a space.  When omitted, spaces
			are left blank.
							*lcs-trail*
	  trail:c	Character to show for trailing spaces.  When omitted,
			trailing spaces are blank.  Overrides the "space"
			setting for trailing spaces.
							*lcs-extends*
	  extends:c	Character to show in the last column, when 'wrap' is
			off and the line continues beyond the right of the
			screen.
							*lcs-precedes*
	  precedes:c	Character to show in the first column, when 'wrap'
			is off and there is text preceding the character
			visible in the first column.
							*lcs-conceal*
	  conceal:c	Character to show in place of concealed text, when
			'conceallevel' is set to 1.  A space when omitted.
							*lcs-nbsp*
	  nbsp:c	Character to show for a non-breakable space character
			(0xA0 (160 decimal) and U+202F).  Left blank when
			omitted.

	The characters ':' and ',' should not be used.  UTF-8 characters can
	be used.  All characters must be single width.

	Examples: >
	    :set lcs=tab:>-,trail:-
	    :set lcs=tab:>-,eol:<,nbsp:%
	    :set lcs=extends:>,precedes:<
<	The "NonText" highlighting will be used for "eol", "extends" and
	"precedes".  "SpecialKey" for "nbsp", "space", "tab" and "trail".
	|hl-NonText| |hl-SpecialKey|

			*'lpl'* *'nolpl'* *'loadplugins'* *'noloadplugins'*
'loadplugins' 'lpl'	boolean	(default on)
			global
	When on the plugin scripts are loaded when starting up |load-plugins|.
	This option can be reset in your |vimrc| file to disable the loading
	of plugins.
	Note that using the "-u NONE" and "--noplugin" command line arguments
	reset this option. |-u| |--noplugin|

						*'magic'* *'nomagic'*
'magic'			boolean	(default on)
			global
	Changes the special characters that can be used in search patterns.
	See |pattern|.
	NOTE: To avoid portability problems with using patterns, always keep
	this option at the default "on".  Only switch it off when working with
	old Vi scripts.  In any other situation write patterns that work when
	'magic' is on.  Include "\M" when you want to |/\M|.

						*'makeef'* *'mef'*
'makeef' 'mef'		string	(default: "")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	Name of the errorfile for the |:make| command (see |:make_makeprg|)
	and the |:grep| command.
	When it is empty, an internally generated temp file will be used.
	When "##" is included, it is replaced by a number to make the name
	unique.  This makes sure that the ":make" command doesn't overwrite an
	existing file.
	NOT used for the ":cf" command.  See 'errorfile' for that.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'makeprg'* *'mp'*
'makeprg' 'mp'		string	(default "make")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	Program to use for the ":make" command.  See |:make_makeprg|.
	This option may contain '%' and '#' characters (see  |:_%| and |:_#|),
	which are expanded to the current and alternate file name.  Use |::S|
	to escape file names in case they contain special characters.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.
	Note that a '|' must be escaped twice: once for ":set" and once for
	the interpretation of a command.  When you use a filter called
	"myfilter" do it like this: >
	    :set makeprg=gmake\ \\\|\ myfilter
<	The placeholder "$*" can be given (even multiple times) to specify
	where the arguments will be included, for example: >
	    :set makeprg=latex\ \\\\nonstopmode\ \\\\input\\{$*}
<	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'matchpairs'* *'mps'*
'matchpairs' 'mps'	string	(default "(:),{:},[:]")
			local to buffer
	Characters that form pairs.  The |%| command jumps from one to the
	other.
	Only character pairs are allowed that are different, thus you cannot
	jump between two double quotes.
	The characters must be separated by a colon.
	The pairs must be separated by a comma.  Example for including '<' and
	'>' (HTML): >
		:set mps+=<:>

<	A more exotic example, to jump between the '=' and ';' in an
	assignment, useful for languages like C and Java: >
		:au FileType c,cpp,java set mps+==:;

<	For a more advanced way of using "%", see the matchit.vim plugin in
	the $VIMRUNTIME/macros directory. |add-local-help|

						*'matchtime'* *'mat'*
'matchtime' 'mat'	number	(default 5)
			global
	Tenths of a second to show the matching paren, when 'showmatch' is
	set.  Note that this is not in milliseconds, like other options that
	set a time.  This is to be compatible with Nvi.

						*'maxcombine'* *'mco'*
'maxcombine' 'mco'	number (default 2)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+multi_byte|
			feature}
	The maximum number of combining characters supported for displaying.
	The default is OK for most languages.  Hebrew may require 4.
	Maximum value is 6.
	Even when this option is set to 2 you can still edit text with more
	combining characters, you just can't see them.  Use |g8| or |ga|.
	See |mbyte-combining|.

						*'maxfuncdepth'* *'mfd'*
'maxfuncdepth' 'mfd'	number	(default 100)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			feature}
	Maximum depth of function calls for user functions.  This normally
	catches endless recursion.  When using a recursive function with
	more depth, set 'maxfuncdepth' to a bigger number.  But this will use
	more memory, there is the danger of failing when memory is exhausted.
	See also |:function|.

						*'maxmapdepth'* *'mmd'* *E223*
'maxmapdepth' 'mmd'	number	(default 1000)
			global
	Maximum number of times a mapping is done without resulting in a
	character to be used.  This normally catches endless mappings, like
	":map x y" with ":map y x".  It still does not catch ":map g wg",
	because the 'w' is used before the next mapping is done.  See also
	|key-mapping|.

						*'maxmem'* *'mm'*
'maxmem' 'mm'		number	(default between 256 to 5120 (system
				 dependent) or half the amount of memory
				 available)
			global
	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for one buffer.  When this
	limit is reached allocating extra memory for a buffer will cause
	other memory to be freed.  The maximum usable value is about 2000000.
	Use this to work without a limit.  Also see 'maxmemtot'.

						*'maxmempattern'* *'mmp'*
'maxmempattern' 'mmp'	number	(default 1000)
			global
	Maximum amount of memory (in Kbyte) to use for pattern matching.
	The maximum value is about 2000000.  Use this to work without a limit.
							*E363*
	When Vim runs into the limit it gives an error message and mostly
	behaves like CTRL-C was typed.
	Running into the limit often means that the pattern is very
	inefficient or too complex.  This may already happen with the pattern
	"\(.\)*" on a very long line.  ".*" works much better.
	Vim may run out of memory before hitting the 'maxmempattern' limit.

						*'maxmemtot'* *'mmt'*
'maxmemtot' 'mmt'	number	(default between 2048 and 10240 (system
				 dependent) or half the amount of memory
				 available)
			global
	Maximum amount of memory in Kbyte to use for all buffers together.
	The maximum usable value is about 2000000 (2 Gbyte).  Use this to work
	without a limit.
	On 64 bit machines higher values might work.  But hey, do you really
	need more than 2 Gbyte for text editing?  Keep in mind that text is
	stored in the swap file, one can edit files > 2 Gbyte anyway.  We do
	need the memory to store undo info.
	Also see 'maxmem'.

						*'menuitems'* *'mis'*
'menuitems' 'mis'	number	(default 25)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+menu|
			feature}
	Maximum number of items to use in a menu.  Used for menus that are
	generated from a list of items, e.g., the Buffers menu.  Changing this
	option has no direct effect, the menu must be refreshed first.

						*'mkspellmem'* *'msm'*
'mkspellmem' 'msm'	string	(default "460000,2000,500")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Parameters for |:mkspell|.  This tunes when to start compressing the
	word tree.  Compression can be slow when there are many words, but
	it's needed to avoid running out of memory.  The amount of memory used
	per word depends very much on how similar the words are, that's why
	this tuning is complicated.

	There are three numbers, separated by commas:
		{start},{inc},{added}

	For most languages the uncompressed word tree fits in memory.  {start}
	gives the amount of memory in Kbyte that can be used before any
	compression is done.  It should be a bit smaller than the amount of
	memory that is available to Vim.

	When going over the {start} limit the {inc} number specifies the
	amount of memory in Kbyte that can be allocated before another
	compression is done.  A low number means compression is done after
	less words are added, which is slow.  A high number means more memory
	will be allocated.

	After doing compression, {added} times 1024 words can be added before
	the {inc} limit is ignored and compression is done when any extra
	amount of memory is needed.  A low number means there is a smaller
	chance of hitting the {inc} limit, less memory is used but it's
	slower.

	The languages for which these numbers are important are Italian and
	Hungarian.  The default works for when you have about 512 Mbyte.  If
	you have 1 Gbyte you could use: >
		:set mkspellmem=900000,3000,800
<	If you have less than 512 Mbyte |:mkspell| may fail for some
	languages, no matter what you set 'mkspellmem' to.

				   *'modeline'* *'ml'* *'nomodeline'* *'noml'*
'modeline' 'ml'		boolean	(Vim default: on (off for root),
				 Vi default: off)
			local to buffer
						*'modelines'* *'mls'*
'modelines' 'mls'	number	(default 5)
			global
	If 'modeline' is on 'modelines' gives the number of lines that is
	checked for set commands.  If 'modeline' is off or 'modelines' is zero
	no lines are checked.  See |modeline|.

				*'modifiable'* *'ma'* *'nomodifiable'* *'noma'* *E21*
'modifiable' 'ma'	boolean	(default on)
			local to buffer
	When off the buffer contents cannot be changed.  The 'fileformat' and
	'fileencoding' options also can't be changed.
	Can be reset with the |-M| command line argument.

				*'modified'* *'mod'* *'nomodified'* *'nomod'*
'modified' 'mod'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	When on, the buffer is considered to be modified.  This option is set
	when:
	1. A change was made to the text since it was last written.  Using the
	   |undo| command to go back to the original text will reset the
	   option.  But undoing changes that were made before writing the
	   buffer will set the option again, since the text is different from
	   when it was written.
	2. 'fileformat' or 'fileencoding' is different from its original
	   value.  The original value is set when the buffer is read or
	   written.  A ":set nomodified" command also resets the original
	   values to the current values and the 'modified' option will be
	   reset.
	   Similarly for 'eol' and 'bomb'.
	This option is not set when a change is made to the buffer as the
	result of a BufNewFile, BufRead/BufReadPost, BufWritePost,
	FileAppendPost or VimLeave autocommand event.  See |gzip-example| for
	an explanation.
	When 'buftype' is "nowrite" or "nofile" this option may be set, but
	will be ignored.

						*'more'* *'nomore'*
'more'			boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
	When on, listings pause when the whole screen is filled.  You will get
	the |more-prompt|.  When this option is off there are no pauses, the
	listing continues until finished.

						*'mouse'* *E538*
'mouse'			string	(default "a")
			global

	Enable the use of the mouse.  Only works for certain terminals.
	For using the mouse in the GUI, see |gui-mouse|.  The mouse can be
	enabled for different modes:
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		i	Insert mode
		c	Command-line mode
		h	all previous modes when editing a help file
		a	all previous modes
		r	for |hit-enter| and |more-prompt| prompt
	Normally you would enable the mouse in all four modes with: >
		:set mouse=a
<	When the mouse is not enabled, the GUI will still use the mouse for
	modeless selection.  This doesn't move the text cursor.

	See |mouse-using|.  Also see |'clipboard'|.

	Note: When enabling the mouse in a terminal, copy/paste will use the
	"* register if there is access to an X-server.  The xterm handling of
	the mouse buttons can still be used by keeping the shift key pressed.
	Also see the 'clipboard' option.

			*'mousefocus'* *'mousef'* *'nomousefocus'* *'nomousef'*
'mousefocus' 'mousef'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{only works in the GUI}
	The window that the mouse pointer is on is automatically activated.
	When changing the window layout or window focus in another way, the
	mouse pointer is moved to the window with keyboard focus.  Off is the
	default because it makes using the pull down menus a little goofy, as
	a pointer transit may activate a window unintentionally.

			*'mousehide'* *'mh'* *'nomousehide'* *'nomh'*
'mousehide' 'mh'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{only works in the GUI}
	When on, the mouse pointer is hidden when characters are typed.
	The mouse pointer is restored when the mouse is moved.

						*'mousemodel'* *'mousem'*
'mousemodel' 'mousem'	string	(default "extend", "popup" for Windows)
			global
	Sets the model to use for the mouse.  The name mostly specifies what
	the right mouse button is used for:
	   extend	Right mouse button extends a selection.  This works
			like in an xterm.
	   popup	Right mouse button pops up a menu.  The shifted left
			mouse button extends a selection.  This works like
			with Microsoft Windows.
	   popup_setpos Like "popup", but the cursor will be moved to the
			position where the mouse was clicked, and thus the
			selected operation will act upon the clicked object.
			If clicking inside a selection, that selection will
			be acted upon, i.e. no cursor move.  This implies of
			course, that right clicking outside a selection will
			end Visual mode.
	Overview of what button does what for each model:
	mouse		    extend		popup(_setpos) ~
	left click	    place cursor	place cursor
	left drag	    start selection	start selection
	shift-left	    search word		extend selection
	right click	    extend selection	popup menu (place cursor)
	right drag	    extend selection	-
	middle click	    paste		paste

	In the "popup" model the right mouse button produces a pop-up menu.
	You need to define this first, see |popup-menu|.

	Note that you can further refine the meaning of buttons with mappings.
	See |gui-mouse-mapping|.  But mappings are NOT used for modeless
	selection (because that's handled in the GUI code directly).

	The 'mousemodel' option is set by the |:behave| command.

					*'mouseshape'* *'mouses'* *E547*
'mouseshape' 'mouses'	string	(default "i:beam,r:beam,s:updown,sd:cross,
					m:no,ml:up-arrow,v:rightup-arrow")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+mouseshape|
			feature}
	This option tells Vim what the mouse pointer should look like in
	different modes.  The option is a comma separated list of parts, much
	like used for 'guicursor'.  Each part consist of a mode/location-list
	and an argument-list:
		mode-list:shape,mode-list:shape,..
	The mode-list is a dash separated list of these modes/locations:
			In a normal window: ~
		n	Normal mode
		v	Visual mode
		ve	Visual mode with 'selection' "exclusive" (same as 'v',
			if not specified)
		o	Operator-pending mode
		i	Insert mode
		r	Replace mode

			Others: ~
		c	appending to the command-line
		ci	inserting in the command-line
		cr	replacing in the command-line
		m	at the 'Hit ENTER' or 'More' prompts
		ml	idem, but cursor in the last line
		e	any mode, pointer below last window
		s	any mode, pointer on a status line
		sd	any mode, while dragging a status line
		vs	any mode, pointer on a vertical separator line
		vd	any mode, while dragging a vertical separator line
		a	everywhere

	The shape is one of the following:
	avail	name		looks like ~
	w x	arrow		Normal mouse pointer
	w x	blank		no pointer at all (use with care!)
	w x	beam		I-beam
	w x	updown		up-down sizing arrows
	w x	leftright	left-right sizing arrows
	w x	busy		The system's usual busy pointer
	w x	no		The system's usual 'no input' pointer
	  x	udsizing	indicates up-down resizing
	  x	lrsizing	indicates left-right resizing
	  x	crosshair	like a big thin +
	  x	hand1		black hand
	  x	hand2		white hand
	  x	pencil		what you write with
	  x	question	big ?
	  x	rightup-arrow	arrow pointing right-up
	w x	up-arrow	arrow pointing up
	  x	<number>	any X11 pointer number (see X11/cursorfont.h)

	The "avail" column contains a 'w' if the shape is available for Win32,
	x for X11.
	Any modes not specified or shapes not available use the normal mouse
	pointer.

	Example: >
		:set mouseshape=s:udsizing,m:no
<	will make the mouse turn to a sizing arrow over the status lines and
	indicate no input when the hit-enter prompt is displayed (since
	clicking the mouse has no effect in this state.)

						*'mousetime'* *'mouset'*
'mousetime' 'mouset'	number	(default 500)
			global
	Defines the maximum time in msec between two mouse clicks for the
	second click to be recognized as a multi click.

							*'nrformats'* *'nf'*
'nrformats' 'nf'	string	(default "bin,hex")
			local to buffer
	This defines what bases Vim will consider for numbers when using the
	CTRL-A and CTRL-X commands for adding to and subtracting from a number
	respectively; see |CTRL-A| for more info on these commands.
	alpha	If included, single alphabetical characters will be
		incremented or decremented.  This is useful for a list with a
		letter index a), b), etc.		*octal-nrformats*
	octal	If included, numbers that start with a zero will be considered
		to be octal.  Example: Using CTRL-A on "007" results in "010".
	hex	If included, numbers starting with "0x" or "0X" will be
		considered to be hexadecimal.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
		"0x100" results in "0x0ff".
	bin	If included, numbers starting with "0b" or "0B" will be
		considered to be binary.  Example: Using CTRL-X on
		"0b1000" subtracts one, resulting in "0b0111".
	Numbers which simply begin with a digit in the range 1-9 are always
	considered decimal.  This also happens for numbers that are not
	recognized as octal or hex.

				*'number'* *'nu'* *'nonumber'* *'nonu'*
'number' 'nu'		boolean	(default off)
			local to window
	Print the line number in front of each line.  When the 'n' option is
	excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped line will not use the column of
	line numbers.
	The 'numberwidth' option can be used to set the room used for the line
	number.
	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, '-'
	characters are put before the number.
	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
	the number.
						*number_relativenumber*
	The 'relativenumber' option changes the displayed number to be
	relative to the cursor.  Together with 'number' there are these
	four combinations (cursor in line 3):

		'nonu'          'nu'            'nonu'          'nu'
		'nornu'         'nornu'         'rnu'           'rnu'

	    |apple          |  1 apple      |  2 apple      |  2 apple
	    |pear           |  2 pear       |  1 pear       |  1 pear
	    |nobody         |  3 nobody     |  0 nobody     |3   nobody
	    |there          |  4 there      |  1 there      |  1 there

						*'numberwidth'* *'nuw'*
'numberwidth' 'nuw'	number	(Vim default: 4  Vi default: 8)
			local to window
			{only available when compiled with the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	Minimal number of columns to use for the line number.  Only relevant
	when the 'number' or 'relativenumber' option is set or printing lines
	with a line number. Since one space is always between the number and
	the text, there is one less character for the number itself.
	The value is the minimum width.  A bigger width is used when needed to
	fit the highest line number in the buffer respectively the number of
	rows in the window, depending on whether 'number' or 'relativenumber'
	is set. Thus with the Vim default of 4 there is room for a line number
	up to 999. When the buffer has 1000 lines five columns will be used.
	The minimum value is 1, the maximum value is 10.

						*'omnifunc'* *'ofu'*
'omnifunc' 'ofu'	string	(default: empty)
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			or |+insert_expand| features}
	This option specifies a function to be used for Insert mode omni
	completion with CTRL-X CTRL-O. |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|
	See |complete-functions| for an explanation of how the function is
	invoked and what it should return.
	This option is usually set by a filetype plugin:
	|:filetype-plugin-on|
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.


			    *'opendevice'* *'odev'* *'noopendevice'* *'noodev'*
'opendevice' 'odev'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{only for Windows}
	Enable reading and writing from devices.  This may get Vim stuck on a
	device that can be opened but doesn't actually do the I/O.  Therefore
	it is off by default.
	Note that on Windows editing "aux.h", "lpt1.txt" and the like also
	result in editing a device.


						*'operatorfunc'* *'opfunc'*
'operatorfunc' 'opfunc'	string	(default: empty)
			global
	This option specifies a function to be called by the |g@| operator.
	See |:map-operator| for more info and an example.

	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

				*'packpath'* *'pp'*
'packpath' 'pp'		string	(default: see 'runtimepath')
			{not in Vi}
	Directories used to find packages.  See |packages|.


						*'paragraphs'* *'para'*
'paragraphs' 'para'	string	(default "IPLPPPQPP TPHPLIPpLpItpplpipbp")
			global
	Specifies the nroff macros that separate paragraphs.  These are pairs
	of two letters (see |object-motions|).

						*'paste'* *'nopaste'*
'paste'			boolean	(default off)
			global
	You probably don't have to set this option: |bracketed-paste-mode|.

	Put Vim in Paste mode.  This is useful if you want to cut or copy
	some text from one window and paste it in Vim.  This will avoid
	unexpected effects.
	Setting this option is useful when using Vim in a terminal, where Vim
	cannot distinguish between typed text and pasted text.  In the GUI, Vim
	knows about pasting and will mostly do the right thing without 'paste'
	being set.  The same is true for a terminal where Vim handles the
	mouse clicks itself.
	This option is reset when starting the GUI.  Thus if you set it in
	your vimrc it will work in a terminal, but not in the GUI.  Setting
	'paste' in the GUI has side effects: e.g., the Paste toolbar button
	will no longer work in Insert mode, because it uses a mapping.
	When the 'paste' option is switched on (also when it was already on):
		- mapping in Insert mode and Command-line mode is disabled
		- abbreviations are disabled
		- 'autoindent' is reset
		- 'expandtab' is reset
		- 'formatoptions' is used like it is empty
		- 'revins' is reset
		- 'ruler' is reset
		- 'showmatch' is reset
		- 'smartindent' is reset
		- 'smarttab' is reset
		- 'softtabstop' is set to 0
		- 'textwidth' is set to 0
		- 'wrapmargin' is set to 0
	These options keep their value, but their effect is disabled:
		- 'cindent'
		- 'indentexpr'
		- 'lisp'
	NOTE: When you start editing another file while the 'paste' option is
	on, settings from the modelines or autocommands may change the
	settings again, causing trouble when pasting text.  You might want to
	set the 'paste' option again.
	When the 'paste' option is reset the mentioned options are restored to
	the value before the moment 'paste' was switched from off to on.
	Resetting 'paste' before ever setting it does not have any effect.
	Since mapping doesn't work while 'paste' is active, you need to use
	the 'pastetoggle' option to toggle the 'paste' option with some key.

						*'pastetoggle'* *'pt'*
'pastetoggle' 'pt'	string	(default "")
			global
	When non-empty, specifies the key sequence that toggles the 'paste'
	option.  This is like specifying a mapping: >
	    :map {keys} :set invpaste<CR>
<	Where {keys} is the value of 'pastetoggle'.
	The difference is that it will work even when 'paste' is set.
	'pastetoggle' works in Insert mode and Normal mode, but not in
	Command-line mode.
	Mappings are checked first, thus overrule 'pastetoggle'.  However,
	when 'paste' is on mappings are ignored in Insert mode, thus you can do
	this: >
	    :map <F10> :set paste<CR>
	    :map <F11> :set nopaste<CR>
	    :imap <F10> <C-O>:set paste<CR>
	    :imap <F11> <nop>
	    :set pastetoggle=<F11>
<	This will make <F10> start paste mode and <F11> stop paste mode.
	Note that typing <F10> in paste mode inserts "<F10>", since in paste
	mode everything is inserted literally, except the 'pastetoggle' key
	sequence.
	When the value has several bytes 'ttimeoutlen' applies.

						*'pex'* *'patchexpr'*
'patchexpr' 'pex'	string	(default "")
			global
	Expression which is evaluated to apply a patch to a file and generate
	the resulting new version of the file.  See |diff-patchexpr|.

					*'patchmode'* *'pm'* *E205* *E206*
'patchmode' 'pm'	string	(default "")
			global
	When non-empty the oldest version of a file is kept.  This can be used
	to keep the original version of a file if you are changing files in a
	source distribution.  Only the first time that a file is written a
	copy of the original file will be kept.  The name of the copy is the
	name of the original file with the string in the 'patchmode' option
	appended.  This option should start with a dot.  Use a string like
	".org".  'backupdir' must not be empty for this to work (Detail: The
	backup file is renamed to the patchmode file after the new file has
	been successfully written, that's why it must be possible to write a
	backup file).  If there was no file to be backed up, an empty file is
	created.
	When the 'backupskip' pattern matches, a patchmode file is not made.
	Using 'patchmode' for compressed files appends the extension at the
	end (e.g., "file.gz.orig"), thus the resulting name isn't always
	recognized as a compressed file.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

				*'path'* *'pa'* *E343* *E345* *E347* *E854*
'path' 'pa'		string	(default on Unix: ".,/usr/include,,"
				   other systems: ".,,")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
	|gf|, [f, ]f, ^Wf, |:find|, |:sfind|, |:tabfind| and other commands,
	provided that the file being searched for has a relative path (not
	starting with "/", "./" or "../").  The directories in the 'path'
	option may be relative or absolute.
	- Use commas to separate directory names: >
		:set path=.,/usr/local/include,/usr/include
<	- Spaces can also be used to separate directory names (for backwards
	  compatibility with version 3.0).  To have a space in a directory
	  name, precede it with an extra backslash, and escape the space: >
		:set path=.,/dir/with\\\ space
<	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with an extra
	  backslash: >
		:set path=.,/dir/with\\,comma
<	- To search relative to the directory of the current file, use: >
		:set path=.
<	- To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
	  commas: >
		:set path=,,
<	- A directory name may end in a ':' or '/'.
	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	- When using |netrw.vim| URLs can be used.  For example, adding
	  "http://www.vim.org" will make ":find index.html" work.
	- Search upwards and downwards in a directory tree using "*", "**" and
	  ";".  See |file-searching| for info and syntax.
	  {not available when compiled without the |+path_extra| feature}
	- Careful with '\' characters, type two to get one in the option: >
		:set path=.,c:\\include
<	  Or just use '/' instead: >
		:set path=.,c:/include
<	Don't forget "." or files won't even be found in the same directory as
	the file!
	The maximum length is limited.  How much depends on the system, mostly
	it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.
	You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of
	'path', see |:checkpath|.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.  To remove the current directory use: >
		:set path-=
<	To add the current directory use: >
		:set path+=
<	To use an environment variable, you probably need to replace the
	separator.  Here is an example to append $INCL, in which directory
	names are separated with a semi-colon: >
		:let &path = &path . "," . substitute($INCL, ';', ',', 'g')
<	Replace the ';' with a ':' or whatever separator is used.  Note that
	this doesn't work when $INCL contains a comma or white space.

			*'preserveindent'* *'pi'* *'nopreserveindent'* *'nopi'*
'preserveindent' 'pi'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	When changing the indent of the current line, preserve as much of the
	indent structure as possible.  Normally the indent is replaced by a
	series of tabs followed by spaces as required (unless |'expandtab'| is
	enabled, in which case only spaces are used).  Enabling this option
	means the indent will preserve as many existing characters as possible
	for indenting, and only add additional tabs or spaces as required.
	'expandtab' does not apply to the preserved white space, a Tab remains
	a Tab.
	NOTE: When using ">>" multiple times the resulting indent is a mix of
	tabs and spaces.  You might not like this.
	Also see 'copyindent'.
	Use |:retab| to clean up white space.

					*'previewheight'* *'pvh'*
'previewheight' 'pvh'	number (default 12)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows| or
			|+quickfix| features}
	Default height for a preview window.  Used for |:ptag| and associated
	commands.  Used for |CTRL-W_}| when no count is given.

					*'previewwindow'* *'nopreviewwindow'*
					*'pvw'* *'nopvw'* *E590*
'previewwindow' 'pvw'	boolean (default off)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows| or
			|+quickfix| features}
	Identifies the preview window.  Only one window can have this option
	set.  It's normally not set directly, but by using one of the commands
	|:ptag|, |:pedit|, etc.

						*'printdevice'* *'pdev'*
'printdevice' 'pdev'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+printer|
			feature}
	The name of the printer to be used for |:hardcopy|.
	See |pdev-option|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'printencoding'* *'penc'*
'printencoding' 'penc'	String	(default empty, except for some systems)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+printer|
			and |+postscript| features}
	Sets the character encoding used when printing.
	See |penc-option|.

						*'printexpr'* *'pexpr'*
'printexpr' 'pexpr'	String	(default: see below)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+printer|
			and |+postscript| features}
	Expression used to print the PostScript produced with |:hardcopy|.
	See |pexpr-option|.

						*'printfont'* *'pfn'*
'printfont' 'pfn'	string	(default "courier")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+printer|
			feature}
	The name of the font that will be used for |:hardcopy|.
	See |pfn-option|.

						*'printheader'* *'pheader'*
'printheader' 'pheader'  string  (default "%<%f%h%m%=Page %N")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+printer|
			feature}
	The format of the header produced in |:hardcopy| output.
	See |pheader-option|.

						*'printmbcharset'* *'pmbcs'*
'printmbcharset' 'pmbcs'  string (default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+printer|,
			|+postscript| and |+multi_byte| features}
	The CJK character set to be used for CJK output from |:hardcopy|.
	See |pmbcs-option|.

						*'printmbfont'* *'pmbfn'*
'printmbfont' 'pmbfn'	string (default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+printer|,
			|+postscript| and |+multi_byte| features}
	List of font names to be used for CJK output from |:hardcopy|.
	See |pmbfn-option|.

						*'printoptions'* *'popt'*
'printoptions' 'popt' string (default "")
			global
			{only available when compiled with |+printer| feature}
	List of items that control the format of the output of |:hardcopy|.
	See |popt-option|.

						*'prompt'* *'noprompt'*
'prompt'		boolean	(default on)
			global
	When on a ":" prompt is used in Ex mode.

						*'pumheight'* *'ph'*
'pumheight' 'ph'	number	(default 0)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+insert_expand| feature}
	Determines the maximum number of items to show in the popup menu for
	Insert mode completion.  When zero as much space as available is used.
	|ins-completion-menu|.


						*'quoteescape'* *'qe'*
'quoteescape' 'qe'	string	(default "\")
			local to buffer
	The characters that are used to escape quotes in a string.  Used for
	objects like a', a" and a` |a'|.
	When one of the characters in this option is found inside a string,
	the following character will be skipped.  The default value makes the
	text "foo\"bar\\" considered to be one string.

				   *'readonly'* *'ro'* *'noreadonly'* *'noro'*
'readonly' 'ro'		boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
	If on, writes fail unless you use a '!'.  Protects you from
	accidentally overwriting a file.  Default on when Vim is started
	in read-only mode ("vim -R") or when the executable is called "view".
	When using ":w!" the 'readonly' option is reset for the current
	buffer, unless the 'Z' flag is in 'cpoptions'.
	When using the ":view" command the 'readonly' option is
	set for the newly edited buffer.

						*'redrawtime'* *'rdt'*
'redrawtime' 'rdt'	number	(default 2000)
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+reltime|
			feature}
	Time in milliseconds for redrawing the display.  Applies to
	'hlsearch', 'inccommand' and |:match| highlighting.
	When redrawing takes more than this many milliseconds no further
	matches will be highlighted.  This is used to avoid that Vim hangs
	when using a very complicated pattern.

						*'regexpengine'* *'re'*
'regexpengine' 're'	number	(default 0)
			global
	This selects the default regexp engine. |two-engines|
	The possible values are:
		0	automatic selection
		1	old engine
		2	NFA engine
	Note that when using the NFA engine and the pattern contains something
	that is not supported the pattern will not match.  This is only useful
	for debugging the regexp engine.
	Using automatic selection enables Vim to switch the engine, if the
	default engine becomes too costly.  E.g., when the NFA engine uses too
	many states.  This should prevent Vim from hanging on a combination of
	a complex pattern with long text.

		*'relativenumber'* *'rnu'* *'norelativenumber'* *'nornu'*
'relativenumber' 'rnu'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
	Show the line number relative to the line with the cursor in front of
	each line. Relative line numbers help you use the |count| you can
	precede some vertical motion commands (e.g. j k + -) with, without
	having to calculate it yourself. Especially useful in combination with
	other commands (e.g. y d c < > gq gw =).
	When the 'n' option is excluded from 'cpoptions' a wrapped
	line will not use the column of line numbers.
	The 'numberwidth' option can be used to set the room used for the line
	number.
	When a long, wrapped line doesn't start with the first character, '-'
	characters are put before the number.
	See |hl-LineNr|  and |hl-CursorLineNr| for the highlighting used for
	the number.

	The number in front of the cursor line also depends on the value of
	'number', see |number_relativenumber| for all combinations of the two
	options.

						*'remap'* *'noremap'*
'remap'			boolean	(default on)
			global
	Allows for mappings to work recursively.  If you do not want this for
	a single entry, use the :noremap[!] command.
	NOTE: To avoid portability problems with Vim scripts, always keep
	this option at the default "on".  Only switch it off when working with
	old Vi scripts.

						*'report'*
'report'		number	(default 2)
			global
	Threshold for reporting number of lines changed.  When the number of
	changed lines is more than 'report' a message will be given for most
	":" commands.  If you want it always, set 'report' to 0.
	For the ":substitute" command the number of substitutions is used
	instead of the number of lines.

				*'revins'* *'ri'* *'norevins'* *'nori'*
'revins' 'ri'		boolean	(default off)
			global
	Inserting characters in Insert mode will work backwards.  See "typing
	backwards" |ins-reverse|.  This option can be toggled with the CTRL-_
	command in Insert mode, when 'allowrevins' is set.
	This option is reset when 'paste' is set and restored when 'paste' is
	reset.

				 *'rightleft'* *'rl'* *'norightleft'* *'norl'*
'rightleft' 'rl'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
	When on, display orientation becomes right-to-left, i.e., characters
	that are stored in the file appear from the right to the left.
	Using this option, it is possible to edit files for languages that
	are written from the right to the left such as Hebrew and Arabic.
	This option is per window, so it is possible to edit mixed files
	simultaneously, or to view the same file in both ways (this is
	useful whenever you have a mixed text file with both right-to-left
	and left-to-right strings so that both sets are displayed properly
	in different windows).  Also see |rileft.txt|.

			*'rightleftcmd'* *'rlc'*
'rightleftcmd' 'rlc'	string	(default "search")
			local to window
	Each word in this option enables the command line editing to work in
	right-to-left mode for a group of commands:

		search		"/" and "?" commands

	This is useful for languages such as Hebrew, Arabic and Farsi.
	The 'rightleft' option must be set for 'rightleftcmd' to take effect.

					 *'ruler'* *'ru'* *'noruler'* *'noru'*
'ruler' 'ru'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+cmdline_info| feature}
	Show the line and column number of the cursor position, separated by a
	comma.  When there is room, the relative position of the displayed
	text in the file is shown on the far right:
		Top	first line is visible
		Bot	last line is visible
		All	first and last line are visible
		45%	relative position in the file
	If 'rulerformat' is set, it will determine the contents of the ruler.
	Each window has its own ruler.  If a window has a status line, the
	ruler is shown there.  Otherwise it is shown in the last line of the
	screen.  If the statusline is given by 'statusline' (i.e. not empty),
	this option takes precedence over 'ruler' and 'rulerformat'
	If the number of characters displayed is different from the number of
	bytes in the text (e.g., for a TAB or a multi-byte character), both
	the text column (byte number) and the screen column are shown,
	separated with a dash.
	For an empty line "0-1" is shown.
	For an empty buffer the line number will also be zero: "0,0-1".
	This option is reset when 'paste' is set and restored when 'paste' is
	reset.
	If you don't want to see the ruler all the time but want to know where
	you are, use "g CTRL-G" |g_CTRL-G|.

						*'rulerformat'* *'ruf'*
'rulerformat' 'ruf'	string	(default empty)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+statusline|
			feature}
	When this option is not empty, it determines the content of the ruler
	string, as displayed for the 'ruler' option.
	The format of this option is like that of 'statusline'.
	The default ruler width is 17 characters.  To make the ruler 15
	characters wide, put "%15(" at the start and "%)" at the end.
	Example: >
		:set rulerformat=%15(%c%V\ %p%%%)
<
				*'runtimepath'* *'rtp'* *vimfiles*
'runtimepath' 'rtp'	string	(default:
					Unix: "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim,
					       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS[1]/nvim,
					       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS[2]/nvim,
					       
					       $XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site,
					       $XDG_DATA_DIRS[1]/nvim/site,

					       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS[1]/nvim/after,
					       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/after")
			global
	This is a list of directories which will be searched for runtime
	files:
	  filetype.vim	filetypes by file name |new-filetype|
	  scripts.vim	filetypes by file contents |new-filetype-scripts|
	  autoload/	automatically loaded scripts |autoload-functions|
	  colors/	color scheme files |:colorscheme|
	  compiler/	compiler files |:compiler|
	  doc/		documentation |write-local-help|
	  ftplugin/	filetype plugins |write-filetype-plugin|
	  indent/	indent scripts |indent-expression|
	  keymap/	key mapping files |mbyte-keymap|
	  lang/		menu translations |:menutrans|
	  menu.vim	GUI menus |menu.vim|
	  pack/		packages |:packadd|
	  plugin/	plugin scripts |write-plugin|
	  print/	files for printing |postscript-print-encoding|
	  spell/	spell checking files |spell|
	  syntax/	syntax files |mysyntaxfile|
	  tutor/	tutorial files |:Tutor|

	And any other file searched for with the |:runtime| command.

	The defaults for most systems are setup to search these locations:
	1. In your home directory (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to $HOME/.config), 
	   for your personal preferences.
	2. In directories which must contain configuration files according to 
	   XDG ($XDG_CONFIG_DIRS).  This also contains preferences from system 
	   administrator (XDG_CONFIG_DIRS defaults to /etc/xdg).
	3. In data home directory, for plugins installed by user.
	4. In nvim/site subdirectories for each directory in $XDG_DATA_DIRS.  
	   This is for plugins which were installed by system administrator, 
	   but are not part of the Neovim distribution. XDG_DATA_DIRS defaults 
	   to /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/, so system administrators are 
	   expected to install site plugins to /usr/share/nvim/site.
	5. In $VIMRUNTIME, for files distributed with Neovim.
							*after-directory*
	6, 7, 8, 9. In after/ subdirectories of 1, 2, 3 and 4, with reverse 
	   ordering.  This is for preferences to overrule or add to the 
	   distributed defaults or system-wide settings (rarely needed).

	More entries are added when using |packages|.

	Note that, unlike 'path', no wildcards like "**" are allowed.  Normal
	wildcards are allowed, but can significantly slow down searching for
	runtime files.  For speed, use as few items as possible and avoid
	wildcards.
	See |:runtime|.
	Example: >
		:set runtimepath=~/vimruntime,/mygroup/vim,$VIMRUNTIME
<	This will use the directory "~/vimruntime" first (containing your
	personal Vim runtime files), then "/mygroup/vim" (shared between a
	group of people) and finally "$VIMRUNTIME" (the distributed runtime
	files).
	You probably should always include $VIMRUNTIME somewhere, to use the
	distributed runtime files.  You can put a directory before $VIMRUNTIME
	to find files which replace a distributed runtime files.  You can put
	a directory after $VIMRUNTIME to find files which add to distributed
	runtime files.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'scroll'* *'scr'*
'scroll' 'scr'		number	(default: half the window height)
			local to window
	Number of lines to scroll with CTRL-U and CTRL-D commands.  Will be
	set to half the number of lines in the window when the window size
	changes.  If you give a count to the CTRL-U or CTRL-D command it will
	be used as the new value for 'scroll'.  Reset to half the window
	height with ":set scroll=0".

			*'scrollbind'* *'scb'* *'noscrollbind'* *'noscb'*
'scrollbind' 'scb'	boolean  (default off)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+scrollbind|
			feature}
	See also |scroll-binding|.  When this option is set, the current
	window scrolls as other scrollbind windows (windows that also have
	this option set) scroll.  This option is useful for viewing the
	differences between two versions of a file, see 'diff'.
	See |'scrollopt'| for options that determine how this option should be
	interpreted.
	This option is mostly reset when splitting a window to edit another
	file.  This means that ":split | edit file" results in two windows
	with scroll-binding, but ":split file" does not.

						*'scrolljump'* *'sj'*
'scrolljump' 'sj'	number	(default 1)
			global
	Minimal number of lines to scroll when the cursor gets off the
	screen (e.g., with "j").  Not used for scroll commands (e.g., CTRL-E,
	CTRL-D).  Useful if your terminal scrolls very slowly.
	When set to a negative number from -1 to -100 this is used as the
	percentage of the window height.  Thus -50 scrolls half the window
	height.

						*'scrolloff'* *'so'*
'scrolloff' 'so'	number	(default 0)
			global
	Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.
	This will make some context visible around where you are working.  If
	you set it to a very large value (999) the cursor line will always be
	in the middle of the window (except at the start or end of the file or
	when long lines wrap).
	For scrolling horizontally see 'sidescrolloff'.

						*'scrollopt'* *'sbo'*
'scrollopt' 'sbo'	string	(default "ver,jump")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+scrollbind|
			feature}
	This is a comma-separated list of words that specifies how
	'scrollbind' windows should behave.  'sbo' stands for ScrollBind
	Options.
	The following words are available:
	    ver		Bind vertical scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
	    hor		Bind horizontal scrolling for 'scrollbind' windows
	    jump	Applies to the offset between two windows for vertical
			scrolling.  This offset is the difference in the first
			displayed line of the bound windows.  When moving
			around in a window, another 'scrollbind' window may
			reach a position before the start or after the end of
			the buffer.  The offset is not changed though, when
			moving back the 'scrollbind' window will try to scroll
			to the desired position when possible.
			When now making that window the current one, two
			things can be done with the relative offset:
			1. When "jump" is not included, the relative offset is
			   adjusted for the scroll position in the new current
			   window.  When going back to the other window, the
			   new relative offset will be used.
			2. When "jump" is included, the other windows are
			   scrolled to keep the same relative offset.  When
			   going back to the other window, it still uses the
			   same relative offset.
	Also see |scroll-binding|.
	When 'diff' mode is active there always is vertical scroll binding,
	even when "ver" isn't there.

						*'sections'* *'sect'*
'sections' 'sect'	string	(default "SHNHH HUnhsh")
			global
	Specifies the nroff macros that separate sections.  These are pairs of
	two letters (See |object-motions|).  The default makes a section start
	at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".

						*'secure'* *'nosecure'* *E523*
'secure'		boolean	(default off)
			global
	When on, ":autocmd", shell and write commands are not allowed in
	".nvimrc" and ".exrc" in the current directory and map commands are
	displayed.  Switch it off only if you know that you will not run into
	problems, or when the 'exrc' option is off.  On Unix this option is
	only used if the ".nvimrc" or ".exrc" is not owned by you.  This can be
	dangerous if the systems allows users to do a "chown".  You better set
	'secure' at the end of your |init.vim| then.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'selection'* *'sel'*
'selection' 'sel'	string	(default "inclusive")
			global
	This option defines the behavior of the selection.  It is only used
	in Visual and Select mode.
	Possible values:
	   value	past line     inclusive ~
	   old		   no		yes
	   inclusive	   yes		yes
	   exclusive	   yes		no
	"past line" means that the cursor is allowed to be positioned one
	character past the line.
	"inclusive" means that the last character of the selection is included
	in an operation.  For example, when "x" is used to delete the
	selection.
	Note that when "exclusive" is used and selecting from the end
	backwards, you cannot include the last character of a line, when
	starting in Normal mode and 'virtualedit' empty.

	The 'selection' option is set by the |:behave| command.

						*'selectmode'* *'slm'*
'selectmode' 'slm'	string	(default "")
			global
	This is a comma separated list of words, which specifies when to start
	Select mode instead of Visual mode, when a selection is started.
	Possible values:
	   mouse	when using the mouse
	   key		when using shifted special keys
	   cmd		when using "v", "V" or CTRL-V
	See |Select-mode|.
	The 'selectmode' option is set by the |:behave| command.

						*'sessionoptions'* *'ssop'*
'sessionoptions' 'ssop'	string	(default: "blank,buffers,curdir,folds,
					       help,tabpages,winsize"
				 Vi default: "blank,buffers,curdir,folds,
					       help,options,tabpages,winsize")
			global
	Changes the effect of the |:mksession| command.  It is a comma
	separated list of words.  Each word enables saving and restoring
	something:
	   word		save and restore ~
	   blank	empty windows
	   buffers	hidden and unloaded buffers, not just those in windows
	   curdir	the current directory
	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
			fold options
	   globals	global variables that start with an uppercase letter
			and contain at least one lowercase letter.  Only
			String and Number types are stored.
	   help		the help window
	   localoptions	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
			global values for local options)
	   options	all options and mappings (also global values for local
			options)
	   resize	size of the Vim window: 'lines' and 'columns'
	   sesdir	the directory in which the session file is located
			will become the current directory (useful with
			projects accessed over a network from different
			systems)
	   slash	backslashes in file names replaced with forward
			slashes
	   tabpages	all tab pages; without this only the current tab page
			is restored, so that you can make a session for each
			tab page separately
	   unix		with Unix end-of-line format (single <NL>), even when
			on Windows or DOS
	   winpos	position of the whole Vim window
	   winsize	window sizes

	Don't include both "curdir" and "sesdir".
	When neither "curdir" nor "sesdir" is included, file names are stored
	with absolute paths.
	"slash" and "unix" are useful on Windows when sharing session files
	with Unix.  The Unix version of Vim cannot source dos format scripts,
	but the Windows version of Vim can source unix format scripts.

				*'shada'* *'sd'* *E526* *E527* *E528*
'shada' 'sd'		string	(Vim default for
				   Win32:  !,'100,<50,s10,h,rA:,rB:
				   others: !,'100,<50,s10,h
				 Vi default: "")
			global
	When non-empty, the shada file is read upon startup and written
	when exiting Vim (see |shada-file|).  The string should be a comma
	separated list of parameters, each consisting of a single character
	identifying the particular parameter, followed by a number or string
	which specifies the value of that parameter.  If a particular
	character is left out, then the default value is used for that
	parameter.  The following is a list of the identifying characters and
	the effect of their value.
	CHAR	VALUE	~
							*shada-!*
	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
							*shada-quote*
	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
		start of a comment!
							*shada-%*
	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix 
		('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on 
		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
		buffers are stored.
							*shada-'*
	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
		'shada' is non-empty.
		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
							*shada-/*
	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
		'history' is used.
							*shada-:*
	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
							*shada-<*
	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in KiB.
							*shada-@*
	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
							*shada-c*
	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual 
		effect.  Current encoding state is described in 
		|shada-encoding|.
							*shada-f*
	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
							*shada-h*
	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the shada
		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
		has been used since the last search command.
							*shada-n*
	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
		the 'n'.  Must be the last one!  If the "-i" argument was
		given when starting Vim, that file name overrides the one
		given here with 'shada'.  Environment variables are expanded
		when opening the file, not when setting the option.
							*shada-r*
	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
							*shada-s*
	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing 
		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for 
		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three 
		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte 
		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit 
		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because 
		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item 
		contents size) = 10253 bytes.

	Example: >
	    :set shada='50,<1000,s100,:0,n~/nvim/shada
<
	'50		Marks will be remembered for the last 50 files you
			edited.
	<1000		Contents of registers (up to 1000 lines each) will be
			remembered.
	s100		Items with contents occupying more then 100 KiB are 
			skipped.
	:0		Command-line history will not be saved.
	n~/nvim/shada	The name of the file to use is "~/nvim/shada".
	no /		Since '/' is not specified, the default will be used,
			that is, save all of the search history, and also the
			previous search and substitute patterns.
	no %		The buffer list will not be saved nor read back.
	no h		'hlsearch' highlighting will be restored.

	When setting 'shada' from an empty value you can use |:rshada| to
	load the contents of the file, this is not done automatically.

	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shell'* *'sh'* *E91*
'shell' 'sh'		string	(default $SHELL or "sh",
					Windows: "cmd.exe")
			global
	Name of the shell to use for ! and :! commands.  When changing the
	value also check these options: 'shellpipe', 'shellslash'
	'shellredir', 'shellquote', 'shellxquote' and 'shellcmdflag'.
	It is allowed to give an argument to the command, e.g.  "csh -f".
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
	If the name of the shell contains a space, you might need to enclose
	it in quotes.  Example: >
		:set shell=\"c:\program\ files\unix\sh.exe\"\ -f
<	Note the backslash before each quote (to avoid starting a comment) and 
	each space (to avoid ending the option value), so better use |:let-&| 
	like this: >
		:let &shell='"C:\Program Files\unix\sh.exe" -f'
<	Also note that the "-f" is not inside the quotes, because it is not 
	part of the command name.
							*shell-unquoting*
	Rules regarding quotes:
	1. Option is split on space and tab characters that are not inside 
	   quotes: "abc def" runs shell named "abc" with additional argument 
	   "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional 
	   arguments (here and below: additional means additional to 
	   'shellcmdflag').
	2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number: 
	   '"abc"', '"a"bc', 'a"b"c', 'ab"c"' and '"a"b"c"' are all equivalent 
	   to just "abc".
	3. Inside quotes backslash preceding backslash means one backslash.  
	   Backslash preceding quote means one quote. Backslash preceding 
	   anything else means backslash and next character literally: 
	   '"a\\b"' is the same as "a\b", '"a\\"b"' runs shell named literally 
	   'a"b', '"a\b"' is the same as "a\b" again.
	4. Outside of quotes backslash always means itself, it cannot be used 
	   to escape quote: 'a\"b"' is the same as "a\b".
	Note that such processing is done after |:set| did its own round of 
	unescaping, so to keep yourself sane use |:let-&| like shown above.

	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellcmdflag'* *'shcf'*
'shellcmdflag' 'shcf'	string	(default: "-c";
				 Windows, when 'shell' does not
				 contain "sh" somewhere: "/c")
			global
	Flag passed to the shell to execute "!" and ":!" commands; e.g.,
	"bash.exe -c ls" or "cmd.exe /c dir".  For Windows
	systems, the default is set according to the value of 'shell', to
	reduce the need to set this option by the user.
	On Unix it can have more than one flag.  Each white space separated
	part is passed as an argument to the shell command.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
	See |shell-unquoting| which talks about separating this option into 
	multiple arguments.
	Also see |dos-shell| for Windows.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellpipe'* *'sp'*
'shellpipe' 'sp'	string	(default ">", "| tee", "|& tee" or "2>&1| tee")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix|
			feature}
	String to be used to put the output of the ":make" command in the
	error file.  See also |:make_makeprg|.  See |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes.
	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
	of this option).
	For Windows the default is ">".  The output is directly saved in a file
	and not echoed to the screen.
	For Unix the default it "| tee".  The stdout of the compiler is saved
	in a file and echoed to the screen.  If the 'shell' option is "csh" or
	"tcsh" after initializations, the default becomes "|& tee".  If the
	'shell' option is "sh", "ksh", "mksh", "pdksh", "zsh" or "bash" the
	default becomes "2>&1| tee".  This means that stderr is also included.
	Before using the 'shell' option a path is removed, thus "/bin/sh" uses
	"sh".
	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set
	there, the 'shellpipe' option changes automatically, unless it was
	explicitly set before.
	When 'shellpipe' is set to an empty string, no redirection of the
	":make" output will be done.  This is useful if you use a 'makeprg'
	that writes to 'makeef' by itself.  If you want no piping, but do
	want to include the 'makeef', set 'shellpipe' to a single space.
	Don't forget to precede the space with a backslash: ":set sp=\ ".
	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellquote'* *'shq'*
'shellquote' 'shq'	string	(default: ""; Windows, when 'shell'
					contains "sh" somewhere: "\"")
			global
	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
	the "!" and ":!" commands.  The redirection is kept outside of the
	quoting.  See 'shellxquote' to include the redirection.  It's
	probably not useful to set both options.
	This is an empty string by default.  Only known to be useful for
	third-party shells on Windows systems, such as the MKS Korn Shell
	or bash, where it should be "\"".  The default is adjusted according
	the value of 'shell', to reduce the need to set this option by the
	user.  See |dos-shell|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'shellredir'* *'srr'*
'shellredir' 'srr'	string	(default ">", ">&" or ">%s 2>&1")
			global
	String to be used to put the output of a filter command in a temporary
	file.  See also |:!|.  See |option-backslash| about including spaces
	and backslashes.
	The name of the temporary file can be represented by "%s" if necessary
	(the file name is appended automatically if no %s appears in the value
	of this option).
	The default is ">".  For Unix, if the 'shell' option is "csh", "tcsh"
	or "zsh" during initializations, the default becomes ">&".  If the
	'shell' option is "sh", "ksh" or "bash" the default becomes
	">%s 2>&1".  This means that stderr is also included.
	For Win32, the Unix checks are done and additionally "cmd" is checked
	for, which makes the default ">%s 2>&1".  Also, the same names with
	".exe" appended are checked for.
	The initialization of this option is done after reading the vimrc
	and the other initializations, so that when the 'shell' option is set
	there, the 'shellredir' option changes automatically unless it was
	explicitly set before.
	In the future pipes may be used for filtering and this option will
	become obsolete (at least for Unix).
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'shellslash'* *'ssl'* *'noshellslash'* *'nossl'*
'shellslash' 'ssl'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{only for MSDOS and MS-Windows}
	When set, a forward slash is used when expanding file names.  This is
	useful when a Unix-like shell is used instead of command.com or
	cmd.exe.  Backward slashes can still be typed, but they are changed to
	forward slashes by Vim.
	Note that setting or resetting this option has no effect for some
	existing file names, thus this option needs to be set before opening
	any file for best results.  This might change in the future.
	'shellslash' only works when a backslash can be used as a path
	separator.  To test if this is so use: >
		if exists('+shellslash')
<
			*'shelltemp'* *'stmp'* *'noshelltemp'* *'nostmp'*
'shelltemp' 'stmp'	boolean	(Vim default on, Vi default off)
			global
	When on, use temp files for shell commands.  When off use a pipe.
	When using a pipe is not possible temp files are used anyway.
	Currently a pipe is only supported on Unix and MS-Windows 2K and
	later.  You can check it with: >
		:if has("filterpipe")
<	The advantage of using a pipe is that nobody can read the temp file
	and the 'shell' command does not need to support redirection.
	The advantage of using a temp file is that the file type and encoding
	can be detected.
	The |FilterReadPre|, |FilterReadPost| and |FilterWritePre|,
	|FilterWritePost| autocommands event are not triggered when
	'shelltemp' is off.
	The `system()` function does not respect this option and always uses
	temp files.

						*'shellxescape'* *'sxe'*
'shellxescape' 'sxe'	string	(default: "";
				 for Windows: "\"&|<>()@^")
			global
	When 'shellxquote' is set to "(" then the characters listed in this
	option will be escaped with a '^' character.  This makes it possible
	to execute most external commands with cmd.exe.

						*'shellxquote'* *'sxq'*
'shellxquote' 'sxq'	string	(default: "";
					for Win32, when 'shell' is cmd.exe: "("
					for Win32, when 'shell' contains "sh"
					somewhere: "\""
					for Unix, when using system(): "\"")
			global
	Quoting character(s), put around the command passed to the shell, for
	the "!" and ":!" commands.  Includes the redirection.  See
	'shellquote' to exclude the redirection.  It's probably not useful
	to set both options.
	When the value is '(' then ')' is appended. When the value is '"('
	then ')"' is appended.
	When the value is '(' then also see 'shellxescape'.
	This is an empty string by default on most systems, but is known to be
	useful for on Win32 version, either for cmd.exe which automatically
	strips off the first and last quote on a command, or 3rd-party shells
	such as the MKS Korn Shell or bash, where it should be "\"".  The
	default is adjusted according the value of 'shell', to reduce the need
	to set this option by the user.  See |dos-shell|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

			*'shiftround'* *'sr'* *'noshiftround'* *'nosr'*
'shiftround' 'sr'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Round indent to multiple of 'shiftwidth'.  Applies to > and <
	commands.  CTRL-T and CTRL-D in Insert mode always round the indent to
	a multiple of 'shiftwidth' (this is Vi compatible).

						*'shiftwidth'* *'sw'*
'shiftwidth' 'sw'	number	(default 8)
			local to buffer
	Number of spaces to use for each step of (auto)indent.  Used for
	|'cindent'|, |>>|, |<<|, etc.
	When zero the 'ts' value will be used.  Use the |shiftwidth()|
	function to get the effective shiftwidth value.

						*'shortmess'* *'shm'*
'shortmess' 'shm'	string	(Vim default "filnxtToO", Vi default: "")
			global
	This option helps to avoid all the |hit-enter| prompts caused by file
	messages, for example  with CTRL-G, and to avoid some other messages.
	It is a list of flags:
	 flag	meaning when present	~
	  f	use "(3 of 5)" instead of "(file 3 of 5)"
	  i	use "[noeol]" instead of "[Incomplete last line]"
	  l	use "999L, 888C" instead of "999 lines, 888 characters"
	  m	use "[+]" instead of "[Modified]"
	  n	use "[New]" instead of "[New File]"
	  r	use "[RO]" instead of "[readonly]"
	  w	use "[w]" instead of "written" for file write message
		and "[a]" instead of "appended" for ':w >> file' command
	  x	use "[dos]" instead of "[dos format]", "[unix]" instead of
		"[unix format]" and "[mac]" instead of "[mac format]".
	  a	all of the above abbreviations

	  o	overwrite message for writing a file with subsequent message
		for reading a file (useful for ":wn" or when 'autowrite' on)
	  O	message for reading a file overwrites any previous message.
		Also for quickfix message (e.g., ":cn").
	  s	don't give "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at TOP" or "search
		hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" messages
	  t	truncate file message at the start if it is too long to fit
		on the command-line, "<" will appear in the left most column.
		Ignored in Ex mode.
	  T	truncate other messages in the middle if they are too long to
		fit on the command line.  "..." will appear in the middle.
		Ignored in Ex mode.
	  W	don't give "written" or "[w]" when writing a file
	  A	don't give the "ATTENTION" message when an existing swap file
		is found.
	  I	don't give the intro message when starting Vim |:intro|.
	  c	don't give |ins-completion-menu| messages.  For example,
		"-- XXX completion (YYY)", "match 1 of 2", "The only match",
		"Pattern not found", "Back at original", etc.
	  q	use "recording" instead of "recording @a"
	  F	don't give the file info when editing a file, like `:silent`
		was used for the command

	This gives you the opportunity to avoid that a change between buffers
	requires you to hit <Enter>, but still gives as useful a message as
	possible for the space available.  To get the whole message that you
	would have got with 'shm' empty, use ":file!"
	Useful values:
	    shm=	No abbreviation of message.
	    shm=a	Abbreviation, but no loss of information.
	    shm=at	Abbreviation, and truncate message when necessary.

						*'showbreak'* *'sbr'* *E595*
'showbreak' 'sbr'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+linebreak|
			feature}
	String to put at the start of lines that have been wrapped.  Useful
	values are "> " or "+++ ": >
		:set showbreak=>\ 
<	Note the backslash to escape the trailing space.  It's easier like
	this: >
		:let &showbreak = '+++ '
<	Only printable single-cell characters are allowed, excluding <Tab> and
	comma (in a future version the comma might be used to separate the
	part that is shown at the end and at the start of a line).
	The characters are highlighted according to the '@' flag in
	'highlight'.
	Note that tabs after the showbreak will be displayed differently.
	If you want the 'showbreak' to appear in between line numbers, add the
	"n" flag to 'cpoptions'.

				     *'showcmd'* *'sc'* *'noshowcmd'* *'nosc'*
'showcmd' 'sc'		boolean	(Vim default: on (off for Unix),
				 Vi default: off)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+cmdline_info| feature}
	Show (partial) command in the last line of the screen.  Set this
	option off if your terminal is slow.
	In Visual mode the size of the selected area is shown:
	- When selecting characters within a line, the number of characters.
	  If the number of bytes is different it is also displayed: "2-6"
	  means two characters and six bytes.
	- When selecting more than one line, the number of lines.
	- When selecting a block, the size in screen characters:
	  {lines}x{columns}.

			*'showfulltag'* *'sft'* *'noshowfulltag'* *'nosft'*
'showfulltag' 'sft'	boolean (default off)
			global
	When completing a word in insert mode (see |ins-completion|) from the
	tags file, show both the tag name and a tidied-up form of the search
	pattern (if there is one) as possible matches.  Thus, if you have
	matched a C function, you can see a template for what arguments are
	required (coding style permitting).
	Note that this doesn't work well together with having "longest" in
	'completeopt', because the completion from the search pattern may not
	match the typed text.

				 *'showmatch'* *'sm'* *'noshowmatch'* *'nosm'*
'showmatch' 'sm'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	When a bracket is inserted, briefly jump to the matching one.  The
	jump is only done if the match can be seen on the screen.  The time to
	show the match can be set with 'matchtime'.
	A Beep is given if there is no match (no matter if the match can be
	seen or not).
	This option is reset when 'paste' is set and restored when 'paste' is
	reset.
	When the 'm' flag is not included in 'cpoptions', typing a character
	will immediately move the cursor back to where it belongs.
	See the "sm" field in 'guicursor' for setting the cursor shape and
	blinking when showing the match.
	The 'matchpairs' option can be used to specify the characters to show
	matches for.  'rightleft' and 'revins' are used to look for opposite
	matches.
	Also see the matchparen plugin for highlighting the match when moving
	around |pi_paren.txt|.
	Note: Use of the short form is rated PG.

				 *'showmode'* *'smd'* *'noshowmode'* *'nosmd'*
'showmode' 'smd'	boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
	If in Insert, Replace or Visual mode put a message on the last line.
	Use the 'M' flag in 'highlight' to set the type of highlighting for
	this message.
	When |XIM| may be used the message will include "XIM".  But this
	doesn't mean XIM is really active.

						*'showtabline'* *'stal'*
'showtabline' 'stal'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	The value of this option specifies when the line with tab page labels
	will be displayed:
		0: never
		1: only if there are at least two tab pages
		2: always
	This is both for the GUI and non-GUI implementation of the tab pages
	line.
	See |tab-page| for more information about tab pages.

						*'sidescroll'* *'ss'*
'sidescroll' 'ss'	number	(default 0)
			global
	The minimal number of columns to scroll horizontally.  Used only when
	the 'wrap' option is off and the cursor is moved off of the screen.
	When it is zero the cursor will be put in the middle of the screen.
	When using a slow terminal set it to a large number or 0.  When using
	a fast terminal use a small number or 1.  Not used for "zh" and "zl"
	commands.

						*'sidescrolloff'* *'siso'*
'sidescrolloff' 'siso'	number (default 0)
			global
	The minimal number of screen columns to keep to the left and to the
	right of the cursor if 'nowrap' is set.  Setting this option to a
	value greater than 0 while having |'sidescroll'| also at a non-zero
	value makes some context visible in the line you are scrolling in
	horizontally (except at beginning of the line).  Setting this option
	to a large value (like 999) has the effect of keeping the cursor
	horizontally centered in the window, as long as one does not come too
	close to the beginning of the line.

	Example: Try this together with 'sidescroll' and 'listchars' as
		 in the following example to never allow the cursor to move
		 onto the "extends" character:

		 :set nowrap sidescroll=1 listchars=extends:>,precedes:<
		 :set sidescrolloff=1


			*'smartcase'* *'scs'* *'nosmartcase'* *'noscs'*
'smartcase' 'scs'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Override the 'ignorecase' option if the search pattern contains upper
	case characters.  Only used when the search pattern is typed and
	'ignorecase' option is on.  Used for the commands "/", "?", "n", "N",
	":g" and ":s".  Not used for "*", "#", "gd", tag search, etc.  After
	"*" and "#" you can make 'smartcase' used by doing a "/" command,
	recalling the search pattern from history and hitting <Enter>.

			     *'smartindent'* *'si'* *'nosmartindent'* *'nosi'*
'smartindent' 'si'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+smartindent| feature}
	Do smart autoindenting when starting a new line.  Works for C-like
	programs, but can also be used for other languages.  'cindent' does
	something like this, works better in most cases, but is more strict,
	see |C-indenting|.  When 'cindent' is on or 'indentexpr' is set,
	setting 'si' has no effect.  'indentexpr' is a more advanced
	alternative.
	Normally 'autoindent' should also be on when using 'smartindent'.
	An indent is automatically inserted:
	- After a line ending in '{'.
	- After a line starting with a keyword from 'cinwords'.
	- Before a line starting with '}' (only with the "O" command).
	When typing '}' as the first character in a new line, that line is
	given the same indent as the matching '{'.
	When typing '#' as the first character in a new line, the indent for
	that line is removed, the '#' is put in the first column.  The indent
	is restored for the next line.  If you don't want this, use this
	mapping: ":inoremap # X^H#", where ^H is entered with CTRL-V CTRL-H.
	When using the ">>" command, lines starting with '#' are not shifted
	right.
	This option is reset when 'paste' is set and restored when 'paste' is
	reset.

				 *'smarttab'* *'sta'* *'nosmarttab'* *'nosta'*
'smarttab' 'sta'	boolean	(default on)
			global
	When on, a <Tab> in front of a line inserts blanks according to
	'shiftwidth'.  'tabstop' or 'softtabstop' is used in other places.  A
	<BS> will delete a 'shiftwidth' worth of space at the start of the
	line.
	When off, a <Tab> always inserts blanks according to 'tabstop' or
	'softtabstop'.  'shiftwidth' is only used for shifting text left or
	right |shift-left-right|.
	What gets inserted (a <Tab> or spaces) depends on the 'expandtab'
	option.  Also see |ins-expandtab|.  When 'expandtab' is not set, the
	number of spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.
	This option is reset when 'paste' is set and restored when 'paste' is
	reset.

					*'softtabstop'* *'sts'*
'softtabstop' 'sts'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
	Number of spaces that a <Tab> counts for while performing editing
	operations, like inserting a <Tab> or using <BS>.  It "feels" like
	<Tab>s are being inserted, while in fact a mix of spaces and <Tab>s is
	used.  This is useful to keep the 'ts' setting at its standard value
	of 8, while being able to edit like it is set to 'sts'.  However,
	commands like "x" still work on the actual characters.
	When 'sts' is zero, this feature is off.
	When 'sts' is negative, the value of 'shiftwidth' is used.
	'softtabstop' is set to 0 when the 'paste' option is set and restored
	when 'paste' is reset.
	See also |ins-expandtab|.  When 'expandtab' is not set, the number of
	spaces is minimized by using <Tab>s.
	The 'L' flag in 'cpoptions' changes how tabs are used when 'list' is
	set.

						*'spell'* *'nospell'*
'spell'			boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	When on spell checking will be done.  See |spell|.
	The languages are specified with 'spelllang'.

						*'spellcapcheck'* *'spc'*
'spellcapcheck' 'spc'	string	(default "[.?!]\_[\])'" \t]\+")
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Pattern to locate the end of a sentence.  The following word will be
	checked to start with a capital letter.  If not then it is highlighted
	with SpellCap |hl-SpellCap| (unless the word is also badly spelled).
	When this check is not wanted make this option empty.
	Only used when 'spell' is set.
	Be careful with special characters, see |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes.
	To set this option automatically depending on the language, see
	|set-spc-auto|.

						*'spellfile'* *'spf'*
'spellfile' 'spf'	string	(default empty)
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Name of the word list file where words are added for the |zg| and |zw|
	commands.  It must end in ".{encoding}.add".  You need to include the
	path, otherwise the file is placed in the current directory.
								*E765*
	It may also be a comma separated list of names.  A count before the
	|zg| and |zw| commands can be used to access each.  This allows using
	a personal word list file and a project word list file.
	When a word is added while this option is empty Vim will set it for
	you: Using the first directory in 'runtimepath' that is writable.  If
	there is no "spell" directory yet it will be created.  For the file
	name the first language name that appears in 'spelllang' is used,
	ignoring the region.
	The resulting ".spl" file will be used for spell checking, it does not
	have to appear in 'spelllang'.
	Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
	name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
	'spellfile' is set to it, for entries in 'spelllang' only files
	without region name will be found.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'spelllang'* *'spl'*
'spelllang' 'spl'	string	(default "en")
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	A comma separated list of word list names.  When the 'spell' option is
	on spellchecking will be done for these languages.  Example: >
		set spelllang=en_us,nl,medical
<	This means US English, Dutch and medical words are recognized.  Words
	that are not recognized will be highlighted.
	The word list name must not include a comma or dot.  Using a dash is
	recommended to separate the two letter language name from a
	specification.  Thus "en-rare" is used for rare English words.
	A region name must come last and have the form "_xx", where "xx" is
	the two-letter, lower case region name.  You can use more than one
	region by listing them: "en_us,en_ca" supports both US and Canadian
	English, but not words specific for Australia, New Zealand or Great
	Britain. (Note: currently en_au and en_nz dictionaries are older than
	en_ca, en_gb and en_us).
	If the name "cjk" is included East Asian characters are excluded from
	spell checking.  This is useful when editing text that also has Asian
	words.
							*E757*
	As a special case the name of a .spl file can be given as-is.  The
	first "_xx" in the name is removed and used as the region name
	(_xx is an underscore, two letters and followed by a non-letter).
	This is mainly for testing purposes.  You must make sure the correct
	encoding is used, Vim doesn't check it.
	How the related spell files are found is explained here: |spell-load|.

	If the |spellfile.vim| plugin is active and you use a language name
	for which Vim cannot find the .spl file in 'runtimepath' the plugin
	will ask you if you want to download the file.

	After this option has been set successfully, Vim will source the files
	"spell/LANG.vim" in 'runtimepath'.  "LANG" is the value of 'spelllang'
	up to the first comma, dot or underscore.
	Also see |set-spc-auto|.


						*'spellsuggest'* *'sps'*
'spellsuggest' 'sps'	string	(default "best")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Methods used for spelling suggestions.  Both for the |z=| command and
	the |spellsuggest()| function.  This is a comma-separated list of
	items:

	best		Internal method that works best for English.  Finds
			changes like "fast" and uses a bit of sound-a-like
			scoring to improve the ordering.

	double		Internal method that uses two methods and mixes the
			results.  The first method is "fast", the other method
			computes how much the suggestion sounds like the bad
			word.  That only works when the language specifies
			sound folding.  Can be slow and doesn't always give
			better results.

	fast		Internal method that only checks for simple changes:
			character inserts/deletes/swaps.  Works well for
			simple typing mistakes.

	{number}	The maximum number of suggestions listed for |z=|.
			Not used for |spellsuggest()|.  The number of
			suggestions is never more than the value of 'lines'
			minus two.

	file:{filename} Read file {filename}, which must have two columns,
			separated by a slash.  The first column contains the
			bad word, the second column the suggested good word.
			Example:
				theribal/terrible ~
			Use this for common mistakes that do not appear at the
			top of the suggestion list with the internal methods.
			Lines without a slash are ignored, use this for
			comments.
			The word in the second column must be correct,
			otherwise it will not be used.  Add the word to an
			".add" file if it is currently flagged as a spelling
			mistake.
			The file is used for all languages.

	expr:{expr}	Evaluate expression {expr}.  Use a function to avoid
			trouble with spaces.  |v:val| holds the badly spelled
			word.  The expression must evaluate to a List of
			Lists, each with a suggestion and a score.
			Example:
				[['the', 33], ['that', 44]]
			Set 'verbose' and use |z=| to see the scores that the
			internal methods use.  A lower score is better.
			This may invoke |spellsuggest()| if you temporarily
			set 'spellsuggest' to exclude the "expr:" part.
			Errors are silently ignored, unless you set the
			'verbose' option to a non-zero value.

	Only one of "best", "double" or "fast" may be used.  The others may
	appear several times in any order.  Example: >
		:set sps=file:~/.config/nvim/sugg,best,expr:MySuggest()
<
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.


			*'splitbelow'* *'sb'* *'nosplitbelow'* *'nosb'*
'splitbelow' 'sb'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	When on, splitting a window will put the new window below the current
	one. |:split|

			*'splitright'* *'spr'* *'nosplitright'* *'nospr'*
'splitright' 'spr'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	When on, splitting a window will put the new window right of the
	current one. |:vsplit|

			   *'startofline'* *'sol'* *'nostartofline'* *'nosol'*
'startofline' 'sol'	boolean	(default on)
			global
	When "on" the commands listed below move the cursor to the first
	non-blank of the line.  When off the cursor is kept in the same column
	(if possible).  This applies to the commands: CTRL-D, CTRL-U, CTRL-B,
	CTRL-F, "G", "H", "M", "L", gg, and to the commands "d", "<<" and ">>"
	with a linewise operator, with "%" with a count and to buffer changing
	commands (CTRL-^, :bnext, :bNext, etc.).  Also for an Ex command that
	only has a line number, e.g., ":25" or ":+".
	In case of buffer changing commands the cursor is placed at the column
	where it was the last time the buffer was edited.

			   *'statusline'* *'stl'* *E540* *E542*
'statusline' 'stl'	string	(default empty)
			global or local to window |global-local|
			{not available when compiled without the |+statusline|
			feature}
	When nonempty, this option determines the content of the status line.
	Also see |status-line|.

	The option consists of printf style '%' items interspersed with
	normal text.  Each status line item is of the form:
	  %-0{minwid}.{maxwid}{item}
	All fields except the {item} are optional.  A single percent sign can
	be given as "%%".  Up to 80 items can be specified.  *E541*

	When the option starts with "%!" then it is used as an expression,
	evaluated and the result is used as the option value.  Example: >
		:set statusline=%!MyStatusLine()
<	The result can contain %{} items that will be evaluated too.
	Note that the "%!" expression is evaluated in the context of the
	current window and buffer, while %{} items are evaluated in the
	context of the window that the statusline belongs to.

	When there is error while evaluating the option then it will be made
	empty to avoid further errors.  Otherwise screen updating would loop.

	Note that the only effect of 'ruler' when this option is set (and
	'laststatus' is 2) is controlling the output of |CTRL-G|.

	field	    meaning ~
	-	    Left justify the item.  The default is right justified
		    when minwid is larger than the length of the item.
	0	    Leading zeroes in numeric items.  Overridden by '-'.
	minwid	    Minimum width of the item, padding as set by '-' & '0'.
		    Value must be 50 or less.
	maxwid	    Maximum width of the item.  Truncation occurs with a '<'
		    on the left for text items.  Numeric items will be
		    shifted down to maxwid-2 digits followed by '>'number
		    where number is the amount of missing digits, much like
		    an exponential notation.
	item	    A one letter code as described below.

	Following is a description of the possible statusline items.  The
	second character in "item" is the type:
		N for number
		S for string
		F for flags as described below
		- not applicable

	item  meaning ~
	f S   Path to the file in the buffer, as typed or relative to current
	      directory.
	F S   Full path to the file in the buffer.
	t S   File name (tail) of file in the buffer.
	m F   Modified flag, text is "[+]"; "[-]" if 'modifiable' is off.
	M F   Modified flag, text is ",+" or ",-".
	r F   Readonly flag, text is "[RO]".
	R F   Readonly flag, text is ",RO".
	h F   Help buffer flag, text is "[help]".
	H F   Help buffer flag, text is ",HLP".
	w F   Preview window flag, text is "[Preview]".
	W F   Preview window flag, text is ",PRV".
	y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., "[vim]".  See 'filetype'.
	Y F   Type of file in the buffer, e.g., ",VIM".  See 'filetype'.
	q S   "[Quickfix List]", "[Location List]" or empty.
	k S   Value of "b:keymap_name" or 'keymap' when |:lmap| mappings are
	      being used: "<keymap>"
	n N   Buffer number.
	b N   Value of character under cursor.
	B N   As above, in hexadecimal.
	o N   Byte number in file of byte under cursor, first byte is 1.
	      Mnemonic: Offset from start of file (with one added)
	O N   As above, in hexadecimal.
	N N   Printer page number.  (Only works in the 'printheader' option.)
	l N   Line number.
	L N   Number of lines in buffer.
	c N   Column number.
	v N   Virtual column number.
	V N   Virtual column number as -{num}.  Not displayed if equal to 'c'.
	p N   Percentage through file in lines as in |CTRL-G|.
	P S   Percentage through file of displayed window.  This is like the
	      percentage described for 'ruler'.  Always 3 in length, unless
	      translated.
	a S   Argument list status as in default title.  ({current} of {max})
	      Empty if the argument file count is zero or one.
	{ NF  Evaluate expression between '%{' and '}' and substitute result.
	      Note that there is no '%' before the closing '}'.
	( -   Start of item group.  Can be used for setting the width and
	      alignment of a section.  Must be followed by %) somewhere.
	) -   End of item group.  No width fields allowed.
	T N   For 'tabline': start of tab page N label.  Use %T or %X to end 
	      the label.  Clicking this label with left mouse button switches 
	      to the specified tab page.
	X N   For 'tabline': start of close tab N label.  Use %X or %T to end 
	      the label, e.g.: %3Xclose%X.  Use %999X for a "close current 
	      tab" label.    Clicking this label with left mouse button closes 
	      specified tab page.
	@ N   For 'tabline': start of execute function label. Use %X or %T to 
	      end the label, e.g.: %10@SwitchBuffer@foo.c%X.  Clicking this 
	      label runs specified function: in the example when clicking once 
	      using left mouse button on "foo.c" "SwitchBuffer(10, 1, 'l', 
	      '    ')" expression will be run.  Function receives the 
	      following arguments in order:
	      1. minwid field value or zero if no N was specified
	      2. number of mouse clicks to detect multiple clicks
	      3. mouse button used: "l", "r" or "m" for left, right or middle 
	         button respectively; one should not rely on third argument 
	         being only "l", "r" or "m": any other non-empty string value 
	         that contains only ASCII lower case letters may be expected 
	         for other mouse buttons
	      4. modifiers pressed: string which contains "s" if shift 
	         modifier was pressed, "c" for control, "a" for alt and "m" 
	         for meta; currently if modifier is not pressed string 
	         contains space instead, but one should not rely on presence 
	         of spaces or specific order of modifiers: use |stridx()| to 
	         test whether some modifier is present; string is guaranteed 
	         to contain only ASCII letters and spaces, one letter per 
	         modifier; "?" modifier may also be present, but its presence 
	         is a bug that denotes that new mouse button recognition was 
	         added without modifying code that reacts on mouse clicks on 
	         this label.
	      Note: to test whether your version of Neovim contains this 
	            feature use `has('tablineat')`.
	< -   Where to truncate line if too long.  Default is at the start.
	      No width fields allowed.
	= -   Separation point between alignment sections. Each section will
	      be separated by an equal number of spaces.
	      No width fields allowed.
	# -   Set highlight group.  The name must follow and then a # again.
	      Thus use %#HLname# for highlight group HLname.  The same
	      highlighting is used, also for the statusline of non-current
	      windows.
	* -   Set highlight group to User{N}, where {N} is taken from the
	      minwid field, e.g. %1*.  Restore normal highlight with %* or %0*.
	      The difference between User{N} and StatusLine  will be applied
	      to StatusLineNC for the statusline of non-current windows.
	      The number N must be between 1 and 9.  See |hl-User1..9|

	When displaying a flag, Vim removes the leading comma, if any, when
	that flag comes right after plaintext.  This will make a nice display
	when flags are used like in the examples below.

	When all items in a group becomes an empty string (i.e. flags that are
	not set) and a minwid is not set for the group, the whole group will
	become empty.  This will make a group like the following disappear
	completely from the statusline when none of the flags are set. >
		:set statusline=...%(\ [%M%R%H]%)...
<							*g:actual_curbuf*
	Beware that an expression is evaluated each and every time the status
	line is displayed.  The current buffer and current window will be set
	temporarily to that of the window (and buffer) whose statusline is
	currently being drawn.  The expression will evaluate in this context.
	The variable "actual_curbuf" is set to the 'bufnr()' number of the
	real current buffer.

	The 'statusline' option will be evaluated in the |sandbox| if set from
	a modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'statusline' |textlock|.

	If the statusline is not updated when you want it (e.g., after setting
	a variable that's used in an expression), you can force an update by
	setting an option without changing its value.  Example: >
		:let &ro = &ro

<	A result of all digits is regarded a number for display purposes.
	Otherwise the result is taken as flag text and applied to the rules
	described above.

	Watch out for errors in expressions.  They may render Vim unusable!
	If you are stuck, hold down ':' or 'Q' to get a prompt, then quit and
	edit your vimrc or whatever with "vim -u NONE" to get it right.

	Examples:
	Emulate standard status line with 'ruler' set >
	  :set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
<	Similar, but add ASCII value of char under the cursor (like "ga") >
	  :set statusline=%<%f%h%m%r%=%b\ 0x%B\ \ %l,%c%V\ %P
<	Display byte count and byte value, modified flag in red. >
	  :set statusline=%<%f%=\ [%1*%M%*%n%R%H]\ %-19(%3l,%02c%03V%)%O'%02b'
	  :hi User1 term=inverse,bold cterm=inverse,bold ctermfg=red
<	Display a ,GZ flag if a compressed file is loaded >
	  :set statusline=...%r%{VarExists('b:gzflag','\ [GZ]')}%h...
<	In the |:autocmd|'s: >
	  :let b:gzflag = 1
<	And: >
	  :unlet b:gzflag
<	And define this function: >
	  :function VarExists(var, val)
	  :    if exists(a:var) | return a:val | else | return '' | endif
	  :endfunction
<
						*'suffixes'* *'su'*
'suffixes' 'su'		string	(default ".bak,~,.o,.h,.info,.swp,.obj")
			global
	Files with these suffixes get a lower priority when multiple files
	match a wildcard.  See |suffixes|.  Commas can be used to separate the
	suffixes.  Spaces after the comma are ignored.  A dot is also seen as
	the start of a suffix.  To avoid a dot or comma being recognized as a
	separator, precede it with a backslash (see |option-backslash| about
	including spaces and backslashes).
	See 'wildignore' for completely ignoring files.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	suffixes from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.

						*'suffixesadd'* *'sua'*
'suffixesadd' 'sua'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+file_in_path| feature}
	Comma separated list of suffixes, which are used when searching for a
	file for the "gf", "[I", etc. commands.  Example: >
		:set suffixesadd=.java
<
				*'swapfile'* *'swf'* *'noswapfile'* *'noswf'*
'swapfile' 'swf'	boolean (default on)
			local to buffer
	Use a swapfile for the buffer.  This option can be reset when a
	swapfile is not wanted for a specific buffer.  For example, with
	confidential information that even root must not be able to access.
	Careful: All text will be in memory:
		- Don't use this for big files.
		- Recovery will be impossible!
	A swapfile will only be present when |'updatecount'| is non-zero and
	'swapfile' is set.
	When 'swapfile' is reset, the swap file for the current buffer is
	immediately deleted.  When 'swapfile' is set, and 'updatecount' is
	non-zero, a swap file is immediately created.
	Also see |swap-file|.
	If you want to open a new buffer without creating a swap file for it,
	use the |:noswapfile| modifier.

	This option is used together with 'bufhidden' and 'buftype' to
	specify special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.

						*'switchbuf'* *'swb'*
'switchbuf' 'swb'	string	(default "")
			global
	This option controls the behavior when switching between buffers.
	Possible values (comma separated list):
	   useopen	If included, jump to the first open window that
			contains the specified buffer (if there is one).
			Otherwise: Do not examine other windows.
			This setting is checked with |quickfix| commands, when
			jumping to errors (":cc", ":cn", "cp", etc.).  It is
			also used in all buffer related split commands, for
			example ":sbuffer", ":sbnext", or ":sbrewind".
	   usetab	Like "useopen", but also consider windows in other tab
			pages.
	   split	If included, split the current window before loading
			a buffer for a |quickfix| command that display errors.
			Otherwise: do not split, use current window.
	   vsplit	Just like "split" but split vertically.
	   newtab	Like "split", but open a new tab page.  Overrules
			"split" when both are present.

						*'synmaxcol'* *'smc'*
'synmaxcol' 'smc'	number	(default 3000)
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Maximum column in which to search for syntax items.  In long lines the
	text after this column is not highlighted and following lines may not
	be highlighted correctly, because the syntax state is cleared.
	This helps to avoid very slow redrawing for an XML file that is one
	long line.
	Set to zero to remove the limit.

						*'syntax'* *'syn'*
'syntax' 'syn'		string	(default empty)
			local to buffer
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	When this option is set, the syntax with this name is loaded, unless
	syntax highlighting has been switched off with ":syntax off".
	Otherwise this option does not always reflect the current syntax (the
	b:current_syntax variable does).
	This option is most useful in a modeline, for a file which syntax is
	not automatically recognized.  Example, in an IDL file:
		/* vim: set syntax=idl : */ ~
	When a dot appears in the value then this separates two filetype
	names.  Example:
		/* vim: set syntax=c.doxygen : */ ~
	This will use the "c" syntax first, then the "doxygen" syntax.
	Note that the second one must be prepared to be loaded as an addition,
	otherwise it will be skipped.  More than one dot may appear.
	To switch off syntax highlighting for the current file, use: >
		:set syntax=OFF
<	To switch syntax highlighting on according to the current value of the
	'filetype' option: >
		:set syntax=ON
<	What actually happens when setting the 'syntax' option is that the
	Syntax autocommand event is triggered with the value as argument.
	This option is not copied to another buffer, independent of the 's' or
	'S' flag in 'cpoptions'.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

						*'tabline'* *'tal'*
'tabline' 'tal'		string	(default empty)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	When nonempty, this option determines the content of the tab pages
	line at the top of the Vim window.  When empty Vim will use a default
	tab pages line.  See |setting-tabline| for more info.

	The tab pages line only appears as specified with the 'showtabline'
	option and only when there is no GUI tab line.  When 'e' is in
	'guioptions' and the GUI supports a tab line 'guitablabel' is used
	instead.  Note that the two tab pages lines are very different.

	The value is evaluated like with 'statusline'.  You can use
	|tabpagenr()|, |tabpagewinnr()| and |tabpagebuflist()| to figure out
	the text to be displayed.  Use "%1T" for the first label, "%2T" for
	the second one, etc.  Use "%X" items for closing labels.

	Keep in mind that only one of the tab pages is the current one, others
	are invisible and you can't jump to their windows.


						*'tabpagemax'* *'tpm'*
'tabpagemax' 'tpm'	number	(default 50)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Maximum number of tab pages to be opened by the |-p| command line
	argument or the ":tab all" command. |tabpage|


						*'tabstop'* *'ts'*
'tabstop' 'ts'		number	(default 8)
			local to buffer
	Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.  Also see
	|:retab| command, and 'softtabstop' option.

	Note: Setting 'tabstop' to any other value than 8 can make your file
	appear wrong in many places (e.g., when printing it).

	There are four main ways to use tabs in Vim:
	1. Always keep 'tabstop' at 8, set 'softtabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to 4
	   (or 3 or whatever you prefer) and use 'noexpandtab'.  Then Vim
	   will use a mix of tabs and spaces, but typing <Tab> and <BS> will
	   behave like a tab appears every 4 (or 3) characters.
	2. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use
	   'expandtab'.  This way you will always insert spaces.  The
	   formatting will never be messed up when 'tabstop' is changed.
	3. Set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to whatever you prefer and use a
	   |modeline| to set these values when editing the file again.  Only
	   works when using Vim to edit the file.
	4. Always set 'tabstop' and 'shiftwidth' to the same value, and
	   'noexpandtab'.  This should then work (for initial indents only)
	   for any tabstop setting that people use.  It might be nice to have
	   tabs after the first non-blank inserted as spaces if you do this
	   though.  Otherwise aligned comments will be wrong when 'tabstop' is
	   changed.

			*'tagbsearch'* *'tbs'* *'notagbsearch'* *'notbs'*
'tagbsearch' 'tbs'	boolean	(default on)
			global
	When searching for a tag (e.g., for the |:ta| command), Vim can either
	use a binary search or a linear search in a tags file.  Binary
	searching makes searching for a tag a LOT faster, but a linear search
	will find more tags if the tags file wasn't properly sorted.
	Vim normally assumes that your tags files are sorted, or indicate that
	they are not sorted.  Only when this is not the case does the
	'tagbsearch' option need to be switched off.

	When 'tagbsearch' is on, binary searching is first used in the tags
	files.  In certain situations, Vim will do a linear search instead for
	certain files, or retry all files with a linear search.  When
	'tagbsearch' is off, only a linear search is done.

	Linear searching is done anyway, for one file, when Vim finds a line
	at the start of the file indicating that it's not sorted: >
   !_TAG_FILE_SORTED	0	/some comment/
<	[The whitespace before and after the '0' must be a single <Tab>]

	When a binary search was done and no match was found in any of the
	files listed in 'tags', and case is ignored or a pattern is used
	instead of a normal tag name, a retry is done with a linear search.
	Tags in unsorted tags files, and matches with different case will only
	be found in the retry.

	If a tag file indicates that it is case-fold sorted, the second,
	linear search can be avoided when case is ignored.  Use a value of '2'
	in the "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED" line for this.  A tag file can be case-fold
	sorted with the -f switch to "sort" in most unices, as in the command:
	"sort -f -o tags tags".  For "Exuberant ctags" version 5.x or higher
	(at least 5.5) the --sort=foldcase switch can be used for this as
	well.  Note that case must be folded to uppercase for this to work.

	By default, tag searches are case-sensitive.  Case is ignored when
	'ignorecase' is set and 'tagcase' is "followic", or when 'tagcase' is
	"ignore".

	When 'tagbsearch' is off, tags searching is slower when a full match
	exists, but faster when no full match exists.  Tags in unsorted tags
	files may only be found with 'tagbsearch' off.
	When the tags file is not sorted, or sorted in a wrong way (not on
	ASCII byte value), 'tagbsearch' should be off, or the line given above
	must be included in the tags file.
	This option doesn't affect commands that find all matching tags (e.g.,
	command-line completion and ":help").

							*'tagcase'* *'tc'*
'tagcase' 'tc'		string	(default "followic")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
	This option specifies how case is handled when searching the tags
	file:
	   followic	Follow the 'ignorecase' option
	   ignore	Ignore case
	   match	Match case

						*'taglength'* *'tl'*
'taglength' 'tl'	number	(default 0)
			global
	If non-zero, tags are significant up to this number of characters.

			*'tagrelative'* *'tr'* *'notagrelative'* *'notr'*
'tagrelative' 'tr'	boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
	If on and using a tags file in another directory, file names in that
	tags file are relative to the directory where the tags file is.

						*'tags'* *'tag'* *E433*
'tags' 'tag'		string	(default "./tags;,tags")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	Filenames for the tag command, separated by spaces or commas.  To
	include a space or comma in a file name, precede it with a backslash
	(see |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes).
	When a file name starts with "./", the '.' is replaced with the path
	of the current file.  But only when the 'd' flag is not included in
	'cpoptions'.  Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  Also see
	|tags-option|.
	"*", "**" and other wildcards can be used to search for tags files in
	a directory tree.  See |file-searching|.  E.g., "/lib/**/tags" will
	find all files named "tags" below "/lib".  The filename itself cannot
	contain wildcards, it is used as-is.  E.g., "/lib/**/tags?" will find
	files called "tags?".  {not available when compiled without the
	|+path_extra| feature}
	The |tagfiles()| function can be used to get a list of the file names
	actually used.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	file names from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.

				*'tagstack'* *'tgst'* *'notagstack'* *'notgst'*
'tagstack' 'tgst'	boolean	(default on)
			global
	When on, the |tagstack| is used normally.  When off, a ":tag" or
	":tselect" command with an argument will not push the tag onto the
	tagstack.  A following ":tag" without an argument, a ":pop" command or
	any other command that uses the tagstack will use the unmodified
	tagstack, but does change the pointer to the active entry.
	Resetting this option is useful when using a ":tag" command in a
	mapping which should not change the tagstack.

						*'termbidi'* *'tbidi'*
						*'notermbidi'* *'notbidi'*
'termbidi' 'tbidi'	boolean (default off)
			global
	The terminal is in charge of Bi-directionality of text (as specified
	by Unicode).  The terminal is also expected to do the required shaping
	that some languages (such as Arabic) require.
	Setting this option implies that 'rightleft' will not be set when
	'arabic' is set and the value of 'arabicshape' will be ignored.
	Note that setting 'termbidi' has the immediate effect that
	'arabicshape' is ignored, but 'rightleft' isn't changed automatically.
	For further details see |arabic.txt|.

						*'termguicolors'* *'tgc'*
'termguicolors' 'tgc'	boolean (default off)
			global
	When on, uses |highlight-guifg| and |highlight-guibg| attributes in
	the terminal (thus using 24-bit color). Requires a ISO-8613-3
	compatible terminal.
	Must be set at startup (in your |init.vim| or |--cmd|).

						*'terse'* *'noterse'*
'terse'			boolean	(default off)
			global
	When set: Add 's' flag to 'shortmess' option (this makes the message
	for a search that hits the start or end of the file not being
	displayed).  When reset: Remove 's' flag from 'shortmess' option.  {Vi
	shortens a lot of messages}

						*'textwidth'* *'tw'*
'textwidth' 'tw'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
	Maximum width of text that is being inserted.  A longer line will be
	broken after white space to get this width.  A zero value disables
	this.
	'textwidth' is set to 0 when the 'paste' option is set and restored
	when 'paste' is reset.
	When 'textwidth' is zero, 'wrapmargin' may be used.  See also
	'formatoptions' and |ins-textwidth|.
	When 'formatexpr' is set it will be used to break the line.

						*'thesaurus'* *'tsr'*
'thesaurus' 'tsr'	string	(default "")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	List of file names, separated by commas, that are used to lookup words
	for thesaurus completion commands |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-T|.  Each line in
	the file should contain words with similar meaning, separated by
	non-keyword characters (white space is preferred).  Maximum line
	length is 510 bytes.
	To obtain a file to be used here, check out this ftp site:
	[Sorry this link doesn't work anymore, do you know the right one?] 
	ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/wordlists/  First get the README file.
	To include a comma in a file name precede it with a backslash.  Spaces
	after a comma are ignored, otherwise spaces are included in the file
	name.  See |option-backslash| about using backslashes.
	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.
	Backticks cannot be used in this option for security reasons.

			     *'tildeop'* *'top'* *'notildeop'* *'notop'*
'tildeop' 'top'		boolean	(default off)
			global
	When on: The tilde command "~" behaves like an operator.

				*'timeout'* *'to'* *'notimeout'* *'noto'*
'timeout' 'to'		boolean (default on)
			global
	This option and 'timeoutlen' determine the behavior when part of a
	mapped key sequence has been received. For example, if <c-f> is
	pressed and 'timeout' is set, Nvim will wait 'timeoutlen' milliseconds
	for any key that can follow <c-f> in a mapping.

						*'ttimeout'* *'nottimeout'*
'ttimeout'		boolean (default off)
			global
	This option and 'ttimeoutlen' determine the behavior when part of a
	key code sequence has been received by the terminal UI. For example,
	if the \x1b byte is received and 'ttimeout' is set, Nvim will wait
	'ttimeoutlen' milliseconds for the terminal to complete a byte
	sequence that represents a key that starts with \x1b.

						*'timeoutlen'* *'tm'*
'timeoutlen' 'tm'	number	(default 1000)
			global
	The time in milliseconds that is waited for a mapped sequence to
	complete.

						*'ttimeoutlen'* *'ttm'*
'ttimeoutlen' 'ttm'	number	(default -1)
			global
	The time in milliseconds that is waited for a key code
	sequence to complete. Also used for CTRL-\ CTRL-N and CTRL-\ CTRL-G
	when part of a command has been typed.

						*'title'* *'notitle'*
'title'			boolean	(default off, on when title can be restored)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When on, the title of the window will be set to the value of
	'titlestring' (if it is not empty), or to:
		filename [+=-] (path) - VIM
	Where:
		filename	the name of the file being edited
		-		indicates the file cannot be modified, 'ma' off
		+		indicates the file was modified
		=		indicates the file is read-only
		=+		indicates the file is read-only and modified
		(path)		is the path of the file being edited
		- VIM		the server name |v:servername| or "VIM"
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window titles
	(currently Win32 console, all GUI versions and terminals with a non-
	empty 't_ts' option - this is Unix xterm by default, where 't_ts' is
	taken from the builtin termcap).

								*'titlelen'*
'titlelen'		number	(default 85)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	Gives the percentage of 'columns' to use for the length of the window
	title.  When the title is longer, only the end of the path name is
	shown.  A '<' character before the path name is used to indicate this.
	Using a percentage makes this adapt to the width of the window.  But
	it won't work perfectly, because the actual number of characters
	available also depends on the font used and other things in the title
	bar.  When 'titlelen' is zero the full path is used.  Otherwise,
	values from 1 to 30000 percent can be used.
	'titlelen' is also used for the 'titlestring' option.

						*'titleold'*
'titleold'		string	(default "Thanks for flying Vim")
			global
			{only available when compiled with the |+title|
			feature}
	This option will be used for the window title when exiting Vim if the
	original title cannot be restored.  Only happens if 'title' is on or
	'titlestring' is not empty.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
						*'titlestring'*
'titlestring'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+title|
			feature}
	When this option is not empty, it will be used for the title of the
	window.  This happens only when the 'title' option is on.
	Only works if the terminal supports setting window titles (currently
	Win32 console, all GUI versions and terminals with a non-empty 't_ts'
	option).
	When this option contains printf-style '%' items, they will be
	expanded according to the rules used for 'statusline'.
	Example: >
	    :auto BufEnter * let &titlestring = hostname() . "/" . expand("%:p")
	    :set title titlestring=%<%F%=%l/%L-%P titlelen=70
<	The value of 'titlelen' is used to align items in the middle or right
	of the available space.
	Some people prefer to have the file name first: >
	    :set titlestring=%t%(\ %M%)%(\ (%{expand(\"%:~:.:h\")})%)%(\ %a%)
<	Note the use of "%{ }" and an expression to get the path of the file,
	without the file name.  The "%( %)" constructs are used to add a
	separating space only when needed.
	NOTE: Use of special characters in 'titlestring' may cause the display
	to be garbled (e.g., when it contains a CR or NL character).
	{not available when compiled without the |+statusline| feature}

				     *'ttyfast'* *'tf'* *'nottyfast'* *'notf'*
'ttyfast' 'tf'		Removed. |vim-differences| {Nvim}

						*'undodir'* *'udir'* *E5003*
'undodir' 'udir'	string	(default "$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/undo")
			global
			{only when compiled with the |+persistent_undo| feature}
	List of directory names for undo files, separated with commas.
	See |'backupdir'| for details of the format.
	"." means using the directory of the file.  The undo file name for
	"file.txt" is ".file.txt.un~".
	For other directories the file name is the full path of the edited
	file, with path separators replaced with "%".
	When writing: The first directory that exists is used.  "." always
	works, no directories after "." will be used for writing.  If none of 
	the directories exist Neovim will attempt to create last directory in 
	the list.
	When reading all entries are tried to find an undo file.  The first
	undo file that exists is used.  When it cannot be read an error is
	given, no further entry is used.
	See |undo-persistence|.

				*'undofile'* *'noundofile'* *'udf'* *'noudf'*
'undofile' 'udf'	boolean	(default off)
			local to buffer
			{only when compiled with the |+persistent_undo| feature}
	When on, Vim automatically saves undo history to an undo file when
	writing a buffer to a file, and restores undo history from the same
	file on buffer read.
	The directory where the undo file is stored is specified by 'undodir'.
	For more information about this feature see |undo-persistence|.
	The undo file is not read when 'undoreload' causes the buffer from
	before a reload to be saved for undo.
	When 'undofile' is turned off the undo file is NOT deleted.

						*'undolevels'* *'ul'*
'undolevels' 'ul'	number	(default 1000)
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
	Maximum number of changes that can be undone.  Since undo information
	is kept in memory, higher numbers will cause more memory to be used
	(nevertheless, a single change can use an unlimited amount of memory).
	Set to 0 for Vi compatibility: One level of undo and "u" undoes
	itself: >
		set ul=0
<	But you can also get Vi compatibility by including the 'u' flag in
	'cpoptions', and still be able to use CTRL-R to repeat undo.
	Also see |undo-two-ways|.
	Set to -1 for no undo at all.  You might want to do this only for the
	current buffer: >
		setlocal ul=-1
<	This helps when you run out of memory for a single change.

	The local value is set to -123456 when the global value is to be used.

	Also see |clear-undo|.

						*'undoreload'* *'ur'*
'undoreload' 'ur'	number	(default 10000)
			global
	Save the whole buffer for undo when reloading it.  This applies to the
	":e!" command and reloading for when the buffer changed outside of
	Vim. |FileChangedShell|
	The save only happens when this options is negative or when the number
	of lines is smaller than the value of this option.
	Set this option to zero to disable undo for a reload.

	When saving undo for a reload, any undo file is not read.

	Note that this causes the whole buffer to be stored in memory.  Set
	this option to a lower value if you run out of memory.

						*'updatecount'* *'uc'*
'updatecount' 'uc'	number	(default: 200)
			global
	After typing this many characters the swap file will be written to
	disk.  When zero, no swap file will be created at all (see chapter on
	recovery |crash-recovery|).  'updatecount' is set to zero by starting
	Vim with the "-n" option, see |startup|.  When editing in readonly
	mode this option will be initialized to 10000.
	The swapfile can be disabled per buffer with |'swapfile'|.
	When 'updatecount' is set from zero to non-zero, swap files are
	created for all buffers that have 'swapfile' set.  When 'updatecount'
	is set to zero, existing swap files are not deleted.
	This option has no meaning in buffers where |'buftype'| is "nofile"
	or "nowrite".

						*'updatetime'* *'ut'*
'updatetime' 'ut'	number	(default 4000)
			global
	If this many milliseconds nothing is typed the swap file will be
	written to disk (see |crash-recovery|).  Also used for the
	|CursorHold| autocommand event.

						*'verbose'* *'vbs'*
'verbose' 'vbs'		number	(default 0)
			global
	When bigger than zero, Vim will give messages about what it is doing.
	Currently, these messages are given:
	>= 1	When the shada file is read or written.
	>= 2	When a file is ":source"'ed.
	>= 5	Every searched tags file and include file.
	>= 8	Files for which a group of autocommands is executed.
	>= 9	Every executed autocommand.
	>= 12	Every executed function.
	>= 13	When an exception is thrown, caught, finished, or discarded.
	>= 14	Anything pending in a ":finally" clause.
	>= 15	Every executed Ex command (truncated at 200 characters).

	This option can also be set with the "-V" argument.  See |-V|.
	This option is also set by the |:verbose| command.

	When the 'verbosefile' option is set then the verbose messages are not
	displayed.

						*'verbosefile'* *'vfile'*
'verbosefile' 'vfile'	string	(default empty)
			global
	When not empty all messages are written in a file with this name.
	When the file exists messages are appended.
	Writing to the file ends when Vim exits or when 'verbosefile' is made
	empty.  Writes are buffered, thus may not show up for some time.
	Setting 'verbosefile' to a new value is like making it empty first.
	The difference with |:redir| is that verbose messages are not
	displayed when 'verbosefile' is set.

						*'viewdir'* *'vdir'*
'viewdir' 'vdir'	string	(default: "$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/view")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+mksession|
			feature}
	Name of the directory where to store files for |:mkview|.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.

						*'viewoptions'* *'vop'*
'viewoptions' 'vop'	string	(default: "folds,options,cursor")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+mksession|
			feature}
	Changes the effect of the |:mkview| command.  It is a comma separated
	list of words.  Each word enables saving and restoring something:
	   word		save and restore ~
	   cursor	cursor position in file and in window
	   folds	manually created folds, opened/closed folds and local
			fold options
	   options	options and mappings local to a window or buffer (not
			global values for local options)
	   localoptions same as "options"
	   slash	backslashes in file names replaced with forward
			slashes
	   unix		with Unix end-of-line format (single <NL>), even when
			on Windows or DOS

	"slash" and "unix" are useful on Windows when sharing view files
	with Unix.  The Unix version of Vim cannot source dos format scripts,
	but the Windows version of Vim can source unix format scripts.

					    *'virtualedit'* *'ve'*
'virtualedit' 've'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+virtualedit| feature}
	A comma separated list of these words:
	    block	Allow virtual editing in Visual block mode.
	    insert	Allow virtual editing in Insert mode.
	    all		Allow virtual editing in all modes.
	    onemore	Allow the cursor to move just past the end of the line

	Virtual editing means that the cursor can be positioned where there is
	no actual character.  This can be halfway into a tab or beyond the end
	of the line.  Useful for selecting a rectangle in Visual mode and
	editing a table.
	"onemore" is not the same, it will only allow moving the cursor just
	after the last character of the line.  This makes some commands more
	consistent.  Previously the cursor was always past the end of the line
	if the line was empty.  But it is far from Vi compatible.  It may also
	break some plugins or Vim scripts.  For example because |l| can move
	the cursor after the last character.  Use with care!
	Using the `$` command will move to the last character in the line, not
	past it.  This may actually move the cursor to the left!
	The `g$` command will move to the end of the screen line.
	It doesn't make sense to combine "all" with "onemore", but you will
	not get a warning for it.

			*'visualbell'* *'vb'* *'novisualbell'* *'novb'* *beep*
'visualbell' 'vb'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	Use visual bell instead of beeping.  The terminal code to display the
	visual bell is given with 't_vb'.  When no beep or flash is wanted,
	use ":set vb t_vb=".
	Note: When the GUI starts, 't_vb' is reset to its default value.  You
	might want to set it again in your |gvimrc|.
	In the GUI, 't_vb' defaults to "<Esc>|f", which inverts the display
	for 20 msec.  If you want to use a different time, use "<Esc>|40f",
	where 40 is the time in msec.  Also see 'errorbells'.

						*'warn'* *'nowarn'*
'warn'			boolean	(default on)
			global
	Give a warning message when a shell command is used while the buffer
	has been changed.

						*'whichwrap'* *'ww'*
'whichwrap' 'ww'	string	(Vim default: "b,s", Vi default: "")
			global
	Allow specified keys that move the cursor left/right to move to the
	previous/next line when the cursor is on the first/last character in
	the line.  Concatenate characters to allow this for these keys:
		char   key	  mode	~
		 b    <BS>	 Normal and Visual
		 s    <Space>	 Normal and Visual
		 h    "h"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
		 l    "l"	 Normal and Visual (not recommended)
		 <    <Left>	 Normal and Visual
		 >    <Right>	 Normal and Visual
		 ~    "~"	 Normal
		 [    <Left>	 Insert and Replace
		 ]    <Right>	 Insert and Replace
	For example: >
		:set ww=<,>,[,]
<	allows wrap only when cursor keys are used.
	When the movement keys are used in combination with a delete or change
	operator, the <EOL> also counts for a character.  This makes "3h"
	different from "3dh" when the cursor crosses the end of a line.  This
	is also true for "x" and "X", because they do the same as "dl" and
	"dh".  If you use this, you may also want to use the mapping
	":map <BS> X" to make backspace delete the character in front of the
	cursor.
	When 'l' is included and it is used after an operator at the end of a
	line then it will not move to the next line.  This makes "dl", "cl",
	"yl" etc. work normally.

						*'wildchar'* *'wc'*
'wildchar' 'wc'		number	(Vim default: <Tab>, Vi default: CTRL-E)
			global
	Character you have to type to start wildcard expansion in the
	command-line, as specified with 'wildmode'.
	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.
	The character is not recognized when used inside a macro.  See
	'wildcharm' for that.
	Although 'wc' is a number option, you can set it to a special key: >
		:set wc=<Esc>
<

						*'wildcharm'* *'wcm'*
'wildcharm' 'wcm'	number	(default: none (0))
			global
	'wildcharm' works exactly like 'wildchar', except that it is
	recognized when used inside a macro.  You can find "spare" command-line
	keys suitable for this option by looking at |ex-edit-index|.  Normally
	you'll never actually type 'wildcharm', just use it in mappings that
	automatically invoke completion mode, e.g.: >
		:set wcm=<C-Z>
		:cnoremap ss so $vim/sessions/*.vim<C-Z>
<	Then after typing :ss you can use CTRL-P & CTRL-N.

						*'wildignore'* *'wig'*
'wildignore' 'wig'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+wildignore|
			feature}
	A list of file patterns.  A file that matches with one of these
	patterns is ignored when expanding |wildcards|, completing file or
	directory names, and influences the result of |expand()|, |glob()| and
	|globpath()| unless a flag is passed to disable this.
	The pattern is used like with |:autocmd|, see |autocmd-patterns|.
	Also see 'suffixes'.
	Example: >
		:set wildignore=*.o,*.obj
<	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
	a pattern from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
	uses another default.


			*'wildignorecase'* *'wic'* *'nowildignorecase'* *'nowic'*
'wildignorecase' 'wic'	boolean	(default off)
			global
	When set case is ignored when completing file names and directories.
	Has no effect when 'fileignorecase' is set.
	Does not apply when the shell is used to expand wildcards, which
	happens when there are special characters.


				*'wildmenu'* *'wmnu'* *'nowildmenu'* *'nowmnu'*
'wildmenu' 'wmnu'	boolean	(default on)
			global
			{not available if compiled without the |+wildmenu|
			feature}
	When 'wildmenu' is on, command-line completion operates in an enhanced
	mode.  On pressing 'wildchar' (usually <Tab>) to invoke completion,
	the possible matches are shown just above the command line, with the
	first match highlighted (overwriting the status line, if there is
	one).  Keys that show the previous/next match, such as <Tab> or
	CTRL-P/CTRL-N, cause the highlight to move to the appropriate match.
	When 'wildmode' is used, "wildmenu" mode is used where "full" is
	specified.  "longest" and "list" do not start "wildmenu" mode.
	You can check the current mode with |wildmenumode()|.
	If there are more matches than can fit in the line, a ">" is shown on
	the right and/or a "<" is shown on the left.  The status line scrolls
	as needed.
	The "wildmenu" mode is abandoned when a key is hit that is not used
	for selecting a completion.
	While the "wildmenu" is active the following keys have special
	meanings:

	<Left> <Right>	- select previous/next match (like CTRL-P/CTRL-N)
	<Down>		- in filename/menu name completion: move into a
			  subdirectory or submenu.
	<CR>		- in menu completion, when the cursor is just after a
			  dot: move into a submenu.
	<Up>		- in filename/menu name completion: move up into
			  parent directory or parent menu.

	This makes the menus accessible from the console |console-menus|.

	If you prefer the <Left> and <Right> keys to move the cursor instead
	of selecting a different match, use this: >
		:cnoremap <Left> <Space><BS><Left>
		:cnoremap <Right> <Space><BS><Right>
<
	The "WildMenu" highlighting is used for displaying the current match
	|hl-WildMenu|.

						*'wildmode'* *'wim'*
'wildmode' 'wim'	string	(default: "full")
			global
	Completion mode that is used for the character specified with
	'wildchar'.  It is a comma separated list of up to four parts.  Each
	part specifies what to do for each consecutive use of 'wildchar'.  The
	first part specifies the behavior for the first use of 'wildchar',
	The second part for the second use, etc.
	These are the possible values for each part:
	""		Complete only the first match.
	"full"		Complete the next full match.  After the last match,
			the original string is used and then the first match
			again.
	"longest"	Complete till longest common string.  If this doesn't
			result in a longer string, use the next part.
	"longest:full"	Like "longest", but also start 'wildmenu' if it is
			enabled.
	"list"		When more than one match, list all matches.
	"list:full"	When more than one match, list all matches and
			complete first match.
	"list:longest"	When more than one match, list all matches and
			complete till longest common string.
	When there is only a single match, it is fully completed in all cases.

	Examples: >
		:set wildmode=full
<	Complete first full match, next match, etc.  (the default) >
		:set wildmode=longest,full
<	Complete longest common string, then each full match >
		:set wildmode=list:full
<	List all matches and complete each full match >
		:set wildmode=list,full
<	List all matches without completing, then each full match >
		:set wildmode=longest,list
<	Complete longest common string, then list alternatives.
	More info here: |cmdline-completion|.

						*'wildoptions'* *'wop'*
'wildoptions' 'wop'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+wildignore|
			feature}
	A list of words that change how command line completion is done.
	Currently only one word is allowed:
	  tagfile	When using CTRL-D to list matching tags, the kind of
			tag and the file of the tag is listed.	Only one match
			is displayed per line.  Often used tag kinds are:
				d	#define
				f	function
	Also see |cmdline-completion|.

						*'winaltkeys'* *'wak'*
'winaltkeys' 'wak'	string	(default "menu")
			global
			{only used in Win32}
	Some GUI versions allow the access to menu entries by using the ALT
	key in combination with a character that appears underlined in the
	menu.  This conflicts with the use of the ALT key for mappings and
	entering special characters.  This option tells what to do:
	  no	Don't use ALT keys for menus.  ALT key combinations can be
		mapped, but there is no automatic handling.  This can then be
		done with the |:simalt| command.
	  yes	ALT key handling is done by the windowing system.  ALT key
		combinations cannot be mapped.
	  menu	Using ALT in combination with a character that is a menu
		shortcut key, will be handled by the windowing system.  Other
		keys can be mapped.
	If the menu is disabled by excluding 'm' from 'guioptions', the ALT
	key is never used for the menu.
	This option is not used for <F10>; on Win32.

						*'window'* *'wi'*
'window' 'wi'		number  (default screen height - 1)
			global
	Window height.  Do not confuse this with the height of the Vim window,
	use 'lines' for that.
	Used for |CTRL-F| and |CTRL-B| when there is only one window and the
	value is smaller than 'lines' minus one.  The screen will scroll
	'window' minus two lines, with a minimum of one.
	When 'window' is equal to 'lines' minus one CTRL-F and CTRL-B scroll
	in a much smarter way, taking care of wrapping lines.
	When resizing the Vim window, the value is smaller than 1 or more than
	or equal to 'lines' it will be set to 'lines' minus 1.

						*'winheight'* *'wh'* *E591*
'winheight' 'wh'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Minimal number of lines for the current window.  This is not a hard
	minimum, Vim will use fewer lines if there is not enough room.  If the
	focus goes to a window that is smaller, its size is increased, at the
	cost of the height of other windows.
	Set 'winheight' to a small number for normal editing.
	Set it to 999 to make the current window fill most of the screen.
	Other windows will be only 'winminheight' high.  This has the drawback
	that ":all" will create only two windows.  To avoid "vim -o 1 2 3 4"
	to create only two windows, set the option after startup is done,
	using the |VimEnter| event: >
		au VimEnter * set winheight=999
<	Minimum value is 1.
	The height is not adjusted after one of the commands that change the
	height of the current window.
	'winheight' applies to the current window.  Use 'winminheight' to set
	the minimal height for other windows.

			*'winfixheight'* *'wfh'* *'nowinfixheight'* *'nowfh'*
'winfixheight' 'wfh'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Keep the window height when windows are opened or closed and
	'equalalways' is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.  Set by default for the
	|preview-window| and |quickfix-window|.
	The height may be changed anyway when running out of room.

			*'winfixwidth'* *'wfw'* *'nowinfixwidth'* *'nowfw'*
'winfixwidth' 'wfw'	boolean	(default off)
			local to window
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	Keep the window width when windows are opened or closed and
	'equalalways' is set.  Also for |CTRL-W_=|.
	The width may be changed anyway when running out of room.

						*'winminheight'* *'wmh'*
'winminheight' 'wmh'	number	(default 1)
			global
			{not available when compiled without the |+windows|
			feature}
	The minimal height of a window, when it's not the current window.
	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero lines (i.e. just a
	status bar) if necessary.  They will return to at least one line when
	they become active (since the cursor has to have somewhere to go.)
	Use 'winheight' to set the minimal height of the current window.
	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
	windows.  A value of 0 to 3 is reasonable.

						*'winminwidth'* *'wmw'*
'winminwidth' 'wmw'	number	(default 1)
			global
	The minimal width of a window, when it's not the current window.
	This is a hard minimum, windows will never become smaller.
	When set to zero, windows may be "squashed" to zero columns (i.e. just
	a vertical separator) if necessary.  They will return to at least one
	line when they become active (since the cursor has to have somewhere
	to go.)
	Use 'winwidth' to set the minimal width of the current window.
	This option is only checked when making a window smaller.  Don't use a
	large number, it will cause errors when opening more than a few
	windows.  A value of 0 to 12 is reasonable.

						*'winwidth'* *'wiw'* *E592*
'winwidth' 'wiw'	number	(default 20)
			global
	Minimal number of columns for the current window.  This is not a hard
	minimum, Vim will use fewer columns if there is not enough room.  If
	the current window is smaller, its size is increased, at the cost of
	the width of other windows.  Set it to 999 to make the current window
	always fill the screen.  Set it to a small number for normal editing.
	The width is not adjusted after one of the commands to change the
	width of the current window.
	'winwidth' applies to the current window.  Use 'winminwidth' to set
	the minimal width for other windows.

						*'wrap'* *'nowrap'*
'wrap'			boolean	(default on)
			local to window
	This option changes how text is displayed.  It doesn't change the text
	in the buffer, see 'textwidth' for that.
	When on, lines longer than the width of the window will wrap and
	displaying continues on the next line.  When off lines will not wrap
	and only part of long lines will be displayed.  When the cursor is
	moved to a part that is not shown, the screen will scroll
	horizontally.
	The line will be broken in the middle of a word if necessary.  See
	'linebreak' to get the break at a word boundary.
	To make scrolling horizontally a bit more useful, try this: >
		:set sidescroll=5
		:set listchars+=precedes:<,extends:>
<	See 'sidescroll', 'listchars' and |wrap-off|.
	This option can't be set from a |modeline| when the 'diff' option is
	on.

						*'wrapmargin'* *'wm'*
'wrapmargin' 'wm'	number	(default 0)
			local to buffer
	Number of characters from the right window border where wrapping
	starts.  When typing text beyond this limit, an <EOL> will be inserted
	and inserting continues on the next line.
	Options that add a margin, such as 'number' and 'foldcolumn', cause
	the text width to be further reduced.  This is Vi compatible.
	When 'textwidth' is non-zero, this option is not used.
	See also 'formatoptions' and |ins-textwidth|.

				   *'wrapscan'* *'ws'* *'nowrapscan'* *'nows'*
'wrapscan' 'ws'		boolean	(default on)			*E384* *E385*
			global
	Searches wrap around the end of the file.  Also applies to |]s| and
	|[s|, searching for spelling mistakes.

						   *'write'* *'nowrite'*
'write'			boolean	(default on)
			global
	Allows writing files.  When not set, writing a file is not allowed.
	Can be used for a view-only mode, where modifications to the text are
	still allowed.  Can be reset with the |-m| or |-M| command line
	argument.  Filtering text is still possible, even though this requires
	writing a temporary file.

				   *'writeany'* *'wa'* *'nowriteany'* *'nowa'*
'writeany' 'wa'		boolean	(default off)
			global
	Allows writing to any file with no need for "!" override.

			     *'writebackup'* *'wb'* *'nowritebackup'* *'nowb'*
'writebackup' 'wb'	boolean	(default on with |+writebackup| feature, off
					otherwise)
			global
	Make a backup before overwriting a file.  The backup is removed after
	the file was successfully written, unless the 'backup' option is
	also on.
	WARNING: Switching this option off means that when Vim fails to write
	your buffer correctly and then, for whatever reason, Vim exits, you
	lose both the original file and what you were writing.  Only reset
	this option if your file system is almost full and it makes the write
	fail (and make sure not to exit Vim until the write was successful).
	See |backup-table| for another explanation.
	When the 'backupskip' pattern matches, a backup is not made anyway.

						*'writedelay'* *'wd'*
'writedelay' 'wd'	number	(default 0)
			global
	The number of microseconds to wait for each character sent to the
	screen.  When non-zero, characters are sent to the terminal one by
	one.  For debugging purposes.

Spell checking						*spell*

1. Quick start			|spell-quickstart|
2. Remarks on spell checking	|spell-remarks|
3. Generating a spell file	|spell-mkspell|
4. Spell file format		|spell-file-format|

==============================================================================
1. Quick start					*spell-quickstart* *E756*

This command switches on spell checking: >

	:setlocal spell spelllang=en_us

This switches on the 'spell' option and specifies to check for US English.

The words that are not recognized are highlighted with one of these:
	SpellBad	word not recognized			|hl-SpellBad|
	SpellCap	word not capitalised			|hl-SpellCap|
	SpellRare	rare word				|hl-SpellRare|
	SpellLocal	wrong spelling for selected region	|hl-SpellLocal|

Vim only checks words for spelling, there is no grammar check.

If the 'mousemodel' option is set to "popup" and the cursor is on a badly
spelled word or it is "popup_setpos" and the mouse pointer is on a badly
spelled word, then the popup menu will contain a submenu to replace the bad
word.  Note: this slows down the appearance of the popup menu.

To search for the next misspelled word:

							*]s*
]s			Move to next misspelled word after the cursor.
			A count before the command can be used to repeat.
			'wrapscan' applies.

							*[s*
[s			Like "]s" but search backwards, find the misspelled
			word before the cursor.  Doesn't recognize words
			split over two lines, thus may stop at words that are
			not highlighted as bad.  Does not stop at word with
			missing capital at the start of a line.

							*]S*
]S			Like "]s" but only stop at bad words, not at rare
			words or words for another region.

							*[S*
[S			Like "]S" but search backwards.


To add words to your own word list:

							*zg*
zg			Add word under the cursor as a good word to the first
			name in 'spellfile'.  A count may precede the command
			to indicate the entry in 'spellfile' to be used.  A
			count of two uses the second entry.

			In Visual mode the selected characters are added as a
			word (including white space!).
			When the cursor is on text that is marked as badly
			spelled then the marked text is used.
			Otherwise the word under the cursor, separated by
			non-word characters, is used.

			If the word is explicitly marked as bad word in
			another spell file the result is unpredictable.

							*zG*
zG			Like "zg" but add the word to the internal word list
			|internal-wordlist|.

							*zw*
zw			Like "zg" but mark the word as a wrong (bad) word.
			If the word already appears in 'spellfile' it is
			turned into a comment line.  See |spellfile-cleanup|
			for getting rid of those.

							*zW*
zW			Like "zw" but add the word to the internal word list
			|internal-wordlist|.

zuw							*zug* *zuw*
zug			Undo |zw| and |zg|, remove the word from the entry in
			'spellfile'.  Count used as with |zg|.

zuW							*zuG* *zuW*
zuG			Undo |zW| and |zG|, remove the word from the internal
			word list.  Count used as with |zg|.

							*:spe* *:spellgood*
:[count]spe[llgood] {word}
			Add {word} as a good word to 'spellfile', like with
			|zg|.  Without count the first name is used, with a
			count of two the second entry, etc.

:spe[llgood]! {word}	Add {word} as a good word to the internal word list,
			like with |zG|.

							*:spellw* *:spellwrong*
:[count]spellw[rong] {word}
			Add {word} as a wrong (bad) word to 'spellfile', as
			with |zw|.  Without count the first name is used, with
			a count of two the second entry, etc.

:spellw[rong]! {word}	Add {word} as a wrong (bad) word to the internal word
			list, like with |zW|.

:[count]spellu[ndo] {word}				*:spellu* *:spellundo*
			Like |zuw|.  [count] used as with |:spellgood|.

:spellu[ndo]! {word}	Like |zuW|.  [count] used as with |:spellgood|.


After adding a word to 'spellfile' with the above commands its associated
".spl" file will automatically be updated and reloaded.  If you change
'spellfile' manually you need to use the |:mkspell| command.  This sequence of
commands mostly works well: >
	:edit <file in 'spellfile'>
<	(make changes to the spell file) >
	:mkspell! %

More details about the 'spellfile' format below |spell-wordlist-format|.

							*internal-wordlist*
The internal word list is used for all buffers where 'spell' is set.  It is
not stored, it is lost when you exit Vim.  It is also cleared when 'encoding'
is set.


Finding suggestions for bad words:
							*z=*
z=			For the word under/after the cursor suggest correctly
			spelled words.  This also works to find alternatives
			for a word that is not highlighted as a bad word,
			e.g., when the word after it is bad.
			In Visual mode the highlighted text is taken as the
			word to be replaced.
			The results are sorted on similarity to the word being
			replaced.
			This may take a long time.  Hit CTRL-C when you get
			bored.

			If the command is used without a count the
			alternatives are listed and you can enter the number
			of your choice or press <Enter> if you don't want to
			replace.  You can also use the mouse to click on your
			choice (only works if the mouse can be used in Normal
			mode and when there are no line wraps).  Click on the
			first line (the header) to cancel.

			The suggestions listed normally replace a highlighted
			bad word.  Sometimes they include other text, in that
			case the replaced text is also listed after a "<".

			If a count is used that suggestion is used, without
			prompting.  For example, "1z=" always takes the first
			suggestion.

			If 'verbose' is non-zero a score will be displayed
			with the suggestions to indicate the likeliness to the
			badly spelled word (the higher the score the more
			different).
			When a word was replaced the redo command "." will
			repeat the word replacement.  This works like "ciw",
			the good word and <Esc>.  This does NOT work for Thai
			and other languages without spaces between words.

					*:spellr* *:spellrepall* *E752* *E753*
:spellr[epall]		Repeat the replacement done by |z=| for all matches
			with the replaced word in the current window.

In Insert mode, when the cursor is after a badly spelled word, you can use
CTRL-X s to find suggestions.  This works like Insert mode completion.  Use
CTRL-N to use the next suggestion, CTRL-P to go back. |i_CTRL-X_s|

The 'spellsuggest' option influences how the list of suggestions is generated
and sorted.  See |'spellsuggest'|.

The 'spellcapcheck' option is used to check the first word of a sentence
starts with a capital.  This doesn't work for the first word in the file.
When there is a line break right after a sentence the highlighting of the next
line may be postponed.  Use |CTRL-L| when needed.  Also see |set-spc-auto| for
how it can be set automatically when 'spelllang' is set.

Vim counts the number of times a good word is encountered.  This is used to
sort the suggestions: words that have been seen before get a small bonus,
words that have been seen often get a bigger bonus.  The COMMON item in the
affix file can be used to define common words, so that this mechanism also
works in a new or short file |spell-COMMON|.

==============================================================================
2. Remarks on spell checking				*spell-remarks*

PERFORMANCE

Vim does on-the-fly spell checking.  To make this work fast the word list is
loaded in memory.  Thus this uses a lot of memory (1 Mbyte or more).  There
might also be a noticeable delay when the word list is loaded, which happens
when 'spell' is set and when 'spelllang' is set while 'spell' was already set.
To minimize the delay each word list is only loaded once, it is not deleted
when 'spelllang' is made empty or 'spell' is reset.  When 'encoding' is set
all the word lists are reloaded, thus you may notice a delay then too.


REGIONS

A word may be spelled differently in various regions.  For example, English
comes in (at least) these variants:

	en		all regions
	en_au		Australia
	en_ca		Canada
	en_gb		Great Britain
	en_nz		New Zealand
	en_us		USA

Words that are not used in one region but are used in another region are
highlighted with SpellLocal |hl-SpellLocal|.

Always use lowercase letters for the language and region names.

When adding a word with |zg| or another command it's always added for all
regions.  You can change that by manually editing the 'spellfile'.  See
|spell-wordlist-format|.  Note that the regions as specified in the files in
'spellfile' are only used when all entries in 'spelllang' specify the same
region (not counting files specified by their .spl name).

							*spell-german*
Specific exception: For German these special regions are used:
	de		all German words accepted
	de_de		old and new spelling
	de_19		old spelling
	de_20		new spelling
	de_at		Austria
	de_ch		Switzerland

							*spell-russian*
Specific exception: For Russian these special regions are used:
	ru		all Russian words accepted
	ru_ru		"IE" letter spelling
	ru_yo		"YO" letter spelling

							*spell-yiddish*
Yiddish requires using "utf-8" encoding, because of the special characters
used.  If you are using latin1 Vim will use transliterated (romanized) Yiddish
instead.  If you want to use transliterated Yiddish with utf-8 use "yi-tr".
In a table:
	'encoding'	'spelllang'
	utf-8		yi		Yiddish
	latin1		yi		transliterated Yiddish
	utf-8		yi-tr		transliterated Yiddish

							*spell-cjk*
Chinese, Japanese and other East Asian characters are normally marked as
errors, because spell checking of these characters is not supported. If
'spelllang' includes "cjk", these characters are not marked as errors.  This
is useful when editing text with spell checking while some Asian words are
present.


SPELL FILES						*spell-load*

Vim searches for spell files in the "spell" subdirectory of the directories in
'runtimepath'.  The name is: LL.EEE.spl, where:
	LL	the language name
	EEE	the value of 'encoding'

The value for "LL" comes from 'spelllang', but excludes the region name.
Examples:
	'spelllang'	LL ~
	en_us		en
	en-rare		en-rare
	medical_ca	medical

Only the first file is loaded, the one that is first in 'runtimepath'.  If
this succeeds then additionally files with the name LL.EEE.add.spl are loaded.
All the ones that are found are used.

If no spell file is found the |SpellFileMissing| autocommand event is
triggered.  This may trigger the |spellfile.vim| plugin to offer you
downloading the spell file.

Additionally, the files related to the names in 'spellfile' are loaded.  These
are the files that |zg| and |zw| add good and wrong words to.

Exceptions:
- Vim uses "latin1" when 'encoding' is "iso-8859-15".  The euro sign doesn't
  matter for spelling.
- When no spell file for 'encoding' is found "ascii" is tried.  This only
  works for languages where nearly all words are ASCII, such as English.  It
  helps when 'encoding' is not "latin1", such as iso-8859-2, and English text
  is being edited.  For the ".add" files the same name as the found main
  spell file is used.

For example, with these values:
	'runtimepath' is "~/.config/nvim,/usr/share/vim70,~/.config/nvim/after"
	'encoding'    is "iso-8859-2"
	'spelllang'   is "pl"

Vim will look for:
1. ~/.config/nvim/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.spl
2. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.spl
3. ~/.config/nvim/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.add.spl
4. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.add.spl
5. ~/.config/nvim/after/spell/pl.iso-8859-2.add.spl

This assumes 1. is not found and 2. is found.

If 'encoding' is "latin1" Vim will look for:
1. ~/.config/nvim/spell/pl.latin1.spl
2. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.latin1.spl
3. ~/.config/nvim/after/spell/pl.latin1.spl
4. ~/.config/nvim/spell/pl.ascii.spl
5. /usr/share/vim70/spell/pl.ascii.spl
6. ~/.config/nvim/after/spell/pl.ascii.spl

This assumes none of them are found (Polish doesn't make sense when leaving
out the non-ASCII characters).

A spell file might not be available in the current 'encoding'.  See
|spell-mkspell| about how to create a spell file.  Converting a spell file
with "iconv" will NOT work!

						    *spell-sug-file* *E781*
If there is a file with exactly the same name as the ".spl" file but ending in
".sug", that file will be used for giving better suggestions.  It isn't loaded
before suggestions are made to reduce memory use.

				    *E758* *E759* *E778* *E779* *E780* *E782*
When loading a spell file Vim checks that it is properly formatted.  If you
get an error the file may be truncated, modified or intended for another Vim
version.


SPELLFILE CLEANUP					*spellfile-cleanup*

The |zw| command turns existing entries in 'spellfile' into comment lines.
This avoids having to write a new file every time, but results in the file
only getting longer, never shorter.  To clean up the comment lines in all
".add" spell files do this: >
	:runtime spell/cleanadd.vim

This deletes all comment lines, except the ones that start with "##".  Use
"##" lines to add comments that you want to keep.

You can invoke this script as often as you like.  A variable is provided to
skip updating files that have been changed recently.  Set it to the number of
seconds that has passed since a file was changed before it will be cleaned.
For example, to clean only files that were not changed in the last hour: >
      let g:spell_clean_limit = 60 * 60
The default is one second.


WORDS

Vim uses a fixed method to recognize a word.  This is independent of
'iskeyword', so that it also works in help files and for languages that
include characters like '-' in 'iskeyword'.  The word characters do depend on
'encoding'.

The table with word characters is stored in the main .spl file.  Therefore it
matters what the current locale is when generating it!  A .add.spl file does
not contain a word table though.

For a word that starts with a digit the digit is ignored, unless the word as a
whole is recognized.  Thus if "3D" is a word and "D" is not then "3D" is
recognized as a word, but if "3D" is not a word then only the "D" is marked as
bad.  Hex numbers in the form 0x12ab and 0X12AB are recognized.


WORD COMBINATIONS

It is possible to spell-check words that include a space.  This is used to
recognize words that are invalid when used by themselves, e.g. for "et al.".
It can also be used to recognize "the the" and highlight it.

The number of spaces is irrelevant.  In most cases a line break may also
appear.  However, this makes it difficult to find out where to start checking
for spelling mistakes.  When you make a change to one line and only that line
is redrawn Vim won't look in the previous line, thus when "et" is at the end
of the previous line "al." will be flagged as an error.  And when you type
"the<CR>the" the highlighting doesn't appear until the first line is redrawn.
Use |CTRL-L| to redraw right away.  "[s" will also stop at a word combination
with a line break.

When encountering a line break Vim skips characters such as '*', '>' and '"',
so that comments in C, shell and Vim code can be spell checked.


SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING					*spell-syntax*

Files that use syntax highlighting can specify where spell checking should be
done:

1.  everywhere			   default
2.  in specific items		   use "contains=@Spell"
3.  everywhere but specific items  use "contains=@NoSpell"

For the second method adding the @NoSpell cluster will disable spell checking
again.  This can be used, for example, to add @Spell to the comments of a
program, and add @NoSpell for items that shouldn't be checked.
Also see |:syn-spell| for text that is not in a syntax item.


VIM SCRIPTS

If you want to write a Vim script that does something with spelling, you may
find these functions useful:

    spellbadword()	find badly spelled word at the cursor
    spellsuggest()	get list of spelling suggestions
    soundfold()		get the sound-a-like version of a word


SETTING 'spellcapcheck' AUTOMATICALLY			*set-spc-auto*

After the 'spelllang' option has been set successfully, Vim will source the
files "spell/LANG.vim" in 'runtimepath'.  "LANG" is the value of 'spelllang'
up to the first comma, dot or underscore.  This can be used to set options
specifically for the language, especially 'spellcapcheck'.

The distribution includes a few of these files.  Use this command to see what
they do: >
	:next $VIMRUNTIME/spell/*.vim

Note that the default scripts don't set 'spellcapcheck' if it was changed from
the default value.  This assumes the user prefers another value then.


DOUBLE SCORING						*spell-double-scoring*

The 'spellsuggest' option can be used to select "double" scoring.  This
mechanism is based on the principle that there are two kinds of spelling
mistakes:

1. You know how to spell the word, but mistype something.  This results in a
   small editing distance (character swapped/omitted/inserted) and possibly a
   word that sounds completely different.

2. You don't know how to spell the word and type something that sounds right.
   The edit distance can be big but the word is similar after sound-folding.

Since scores for these two mistakes will be very different we use a list
for each and mix them.

The sound-folding is slow and people that know the language won't make the
second kind of mistakes.  Therefore 'spellsuggest' can be set to select the
preferred method for scoring the suggestions.

==============================================================================
3. Generating a spell file				*spell-mkspell*

Vim uses a binary file format for spelling.  This greatly speeds up loading
the word list and keeps it small.
						    *.aff* *.dic* *Myspell*
You can create a Vim spell file from the .aff and .dic files that Myspell
uses.  Myspell is used by OpenOffice.org and Mozilla. The OpenOffice .oxt 
files are zip files which contain the .aff and .dic files. You should be able
to find them here:
	http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/dictionary
The older, OpenOffice 2 files may be used if this doesn't work:
	http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries
You can also use a plain word list.  The results are the same, the choice
depends on what word lists you can find.

If you install Aap (from www.a-a-p.org) you can use the recipes in the
runtime/spell/??/ directories.  Aap will take care of downloading the files,
apply patches needed for Vim and build the .spl file.

Make sure your current locale is set properly, otherwise Vim doesn't know what
characters are upper/lower case letters.  If the locale isn't available (e.g.,
when using an MS-Windows codepage on Unix) add tables to the .aff file
|spell-affix-chars|.  If the .aff file doesn't define a table then the word
table of the currently active spelling is used.  If spelling is not active
then Vim will try to guess.

							*:mksp* *:mkspell*
:mksp[ell][!] [-ascii] {outname} {inname} ...
			Generate a Vim spell file from word lists.  Example: >
		:mkspell /tmp/nl nl_NL.words
<								*E751*
			When {outname} ends in ".spl" it is used as the output
			file name.  Otherwise it should be a language name,
			such as "en", without the region name.  The file
			written will be "{outname}.{encoding}.spl", where
			{encoding} is the value of the 'encoding' option.

			When the output file already exists [!] must be used
			to overwrite it.

			When the [-ascii] argument is present, words with
			non-ascii characters are skipped.  The resulting file
			ends in "ascii.spl".

			The input can be the Myspell format files {inname}.aff
			and {inname}.dic.  If {inname}.aff does not exist then
			{inname} is used as the file name of a plain word
			list.

			Multiple {inname} arguments can be given to combine
			regions into one Vim spell file.  Example: >
		:mkspell ~/.vim/spell/en /tmp/en_US /tmp/en_CA /tmp/en_AU
<			This combines the English word lists for US, CA and AU
			into one en.spl file.
			Up to eight regions can be combined. *E754* *E755*
			The REP and SAL items of the first .aff file where
			they appear are used. |spell-REP| |spell-SAL|
								*E845*
			This command uses a lot of memory, required to find
			the optimal word tree (Polish, Italian and Hungarian
			require several hundred Mbyte).  The final result will
			be much smaller, because compression is used.  To
			avoid running out of memory compression will be done
			now and then.  This can be tuned with the 'mkspellmem'
			option.

			After the spell file was written and it was being used
			in a buffer it will be reloaded automatically.

:mksp[ell] [-ascii] {name}.{enc}.add
			Like ":mkspell" above, using {name}.{enc}.add as the
			input file and producing an output file in the same
			directory that has ".spl" appended.

:mksp[ell] [-ascii] {name}
			Like ":mkspell" above, using {name} as the input file
			and producing an output file in the same directory
			that has ".{enc}.spl" appended.

Vim will report the number of duplicate words.  This might be a mistake in the
list of words.  But sometimes it is used to have different prefixes and
suffixes for the same basic word to avoid them combining (e.g. Czech uses
this).  If you want Vim to report all duplicate words set the 'verbose'
option.

Since you might want to change a Myspell word list for use with Vim the
following procedure is recommended:

1. Obtain the xx_YY.aff and xx_YY.dic files from Myspell.
2. Make a copy of these files to xx_YY.orig.aff and xx_YY.orig.dic.
3. Change the xx_YY.aff and xx_YY.dic files to remove bad words, add missing
   words, define word characters with FOL/LOW/UPP, etc.  The distributed
   "*.diff" files can be used.
4. Start Vim with the right locale and use |:mkspell| to generate the Vim
   spell file.
5. Try out the spell file with ":set spell spelllang=xx" if you wrote it in
   a spell directory in 'runtimepath', or ":set spelllang=xx.enc.spl" if you
   wrote it somewhere else.

When the Myspell files are updated you can merge the differences:
1. Obtain the new Myspell files as xx_YY.new.aff and xx_UU.new.dic.
2. Use |diff-mode| to see what changed: >
	nvim -d xx_YY.orig.dic xx_YY.new.dic
3. Take over the changes you like in xx_YY.dic.
   You may also need to change xx_YY.aff.
4. Rename xx_YY.new.dic to xx_YY.orig.dic and xx_YY.new.aff to xx_YY.new.aff.


SPELL FILE VERSIONS					*E770* *E771* *E772*

Spell checking is a relatively new feature in Vim, thus it's possible that the
.spl file format will be changed to support more languages.  Vim will check
the validity of the spell file and report anything wrong.

	E771: Old spell file, needs to be updated ~
This spell file is older than your Vim.  You need to update the .spl file.

	E772: Spell file is for newer version of Vim ~
This means the spell file was made for a later version of Vim.  You need to
update Vim.

	E770: Unsupported section in spell file ~
This means the spell file was made for a later version of Vim and contains a
section that is required for the spell file to work.  In this case it's
probably a good idea to upgrade your Vim.


SPELL FILE DUMP

If for some reason you want to check what words are supported by the currently
used spelling files, use this command:

							*:spelldump* *:spelld*
:spelld[ump]		Open a new window and fill it with all currently valid
			words.  Compound words are not included.
			Note: For some languages the result may be enormous,
			causing Vim to run out of memory.

:spelld[ump]!		Like ":spelldump" and include the word count.  This is
			the number of times the word was found while
			updating the screen.  Words that are in COMMON items
			get a starting count of 10.

The format of the word list is used |spell-wordlist-format|.  You should be
able to read it with ":mkspell" to generate one .spl file that includes all
the words.

When all entries to 'spelllang' use the same regions or no regions at all then
the region information is included in the dumped words.  Otherwise only words
for the current region are included and no "/regions" line is generated.

Comment lines with the name of the .spl file are used as a header above the
words that were generated from that .spl file.


SPELL FILE MISSING		*spell-SpellFileMissing* *spellfile.vim*

If the spell file for the language you are using is not available, you will
get an error message.  But if the "spellfile.vim" plugin is active it will
offer you to download the spell file.  Just follow the instructions, it will
ask you where to write the file (there must be a writable directory in
'runtimepath' for this).

The plugin has a default place where to look for spell files, on the Vim ftp
server.  If you want to use another location or another protocol, set the
g:spellfile_URL variable to the directory that holds the spell files.  The
|netrw| plugin is used for getting the file, look there for the specific
syntax of the URL.  Example: >
	let g:spellfile_URL = 'http://ftp.vim.org/vim/runtime/spell'
You may need to escape special characters.

The plugin will only ask about downloading a language once.  If you want to
try again anyway restart Vim, or set g:spellfile_URL to another value (e.g.,
prepend a space).

To avoid using the "spellfile.vim" plugin do this in your vimrc file: >

	let loaded_spellfile_plugin = 1

Instead of using the plugin you can define a |SpellFileMissing| autocommand to
handle the missing file yourself.  You can use it like this: >

	:au SpellFileMissing * call Download_spell_file(expand('<amatch>'))

Thus the <amatch> item contains the name of the language.  Another important
value is 'encoding', since every encoding has its own spell file.  With two
exceptions:
- For ISO-8859-15 (latin9) the name "latin1" is used (the encodings only
  differ in characters not used in dictionary words).
- The name "ascii" may also be used for some languages where the words use
  only ASCII letters for most of the words.

The default "spellfile.vim" plugin uses this autocommand, if you define your
autocommand afterwards you may want to use ":au! SpellFileMissing" to overrule
it.  If you define your autocommand before the plugin is loaded it will notice
this and not do anything.
							*E797*
Note that the SpellFileMissing autocommand must not change or destroy the
buffer the user was editing.

==============================================================================
4. Spell file format					*spell-file-format*

This is the format of the files that are used by the person who creates and
maintains a word list.

Note that we avoid the word "dictionary" here.  That is because the goal of
spell checking differs from writing a dictionary (as in the book).  For
spelling we need a list of words that are OK, thus should not be highlighted.
Person and company names will not appear in a dictionary, but do appear in a
word list.  And some old words are rarely used while they are common
misspellings.  These do appear in a dictionary but not in a word list.

There are two formats: A straight list of words and a list using affix
compression.  The files with affix compression are used by Myspell (Mozilla
and OpenOffice.org).  This requires two files, one with .aff and one with .dic
extension.


FORMAT OF STRAIGHT WORD LIST				*spell-wordlist-format*

The words must appear one per line.  That is all that is required.

Additionally the following items are recognized:

- Empty and blank lines are ignored.

	# comment ~
- Lines starting with a # are ignored (comment lines).

	/encoding=utf-8 ~
- A line starting with "/encoding=", before any word, specifies the encoding
  of the file.  After the second '=' comes an encoding name.  This tells Vim
  to setup conversion from the specified encoding to 'encoding'.  Thus you can
  use one word list for several target encodings.

	/regions=usca ~
- A line starting with "/regions=" specifies the region names that are
  supported.  Each region name must be two ASCII letters.  The first one is
  region 1.  Thus "/regions=usca" has region 1 "us" and region 2 "ca".
  In an addition word list the region names should be equal to the main word
  list!

- Other lines starting with '/' are reserved for future use.  The ones that
  are not recognized are ignored.  You do get a warning message, so that you
  know something won't work.

- A "/" may follow the word with the following items:
    =		Case must match exactly.
    ?		Rare word.
    !		Bad (wrong) word.
    digit	A region in which the word is valid.  If no regions are
		specified the word is valid in all regions.

Example:

	# This is an example word list		comment
	/encoding=latin1			encoding of the file
	/regions=uscagb				regions "us", "ca" and "gb"
	example					word for all regions
	blah/12					word for regions "us" and "ca"
	vim/!					bad word
	Campbell/?3				rare word in region 3 "gb"
	's mornings/=				keep-case word

Note that when "/=" is used the same word with all upper-case letters is not
accepted.  This is different from a word with mixed case that is automatically
marked as keep-case, those words may appear in all upper-case letters.


FORMAT WITH .AFF AND .DIC FILES				*aff-dic-format*

There are two files: the basic word list and an affix file.  The affix file
specifies settings for the language and can contain affixes.  The affixes are
used to modify the basic words to get the full word list.  This significantly
reduces the number of words, especially for a language like Polish.  This is
called affix compression.

The basic word list and the affix file are combined with the ":mkspell"
command and results in a binary spell file.  All the preprocessing has been
done, thus this file loads fast.  The binary spell file format is described in
the source code (src/spell.c).  But only developers need to know about it.

The preprocessing also allows us to take the Myspell language files and modify
them before the Vim word list is made.  The tools for this can be found in the
"src/spell" directory.

The format for the affix and word list files is based on what Myspell uses
(the spell checker of Mozilla and OpenOffice.org).  A description can be found
here:
	http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/affix.readme ~
Note that affixes are case sensitive, this isn't obvious from the description.

Vim supports quite a few extras.  They are described below |spell-affix-vim|.
Attempts have been made to keep this compatible with other spell checkers, so
that the same files can often be used.  One other project that offers more
than Myspell is Hunspell ( http://hunspell.sf.net ).


WORD LIST FORMAT				*spell-dic-format*

A short example, with line numbers:

	1	1234 ~
	2	aan ~
	3	Als ~
	4	Etten-Leur ~
	5	et al. ~
	6	's-Gravenhage ~
	7	's-Gravenhaags ~
	8	# word that differs between regions ~
	9	kado/1 ~
	10	cadeau/2 ~
	11	TCP,IP ~
	12	/the S affix may add a 's' ~
	13	bedel/S ~

The first line contains the number of words.  Vim ignores it, but you do get
an error message if it's not there.  *E760*

What follows is one word per line.  White space at the end of the line is
ignored, all other white space matters.  The encoding is specified in the
affix file |spell-SET|.

Comment lines start with '#' or '/'.  See the example lines 8 and 12.  Note
that putting a comment after a word is NOT allowed:

		someword   # comment that causes an error! ~

After the word there is an optional slash and flags.  Most of these flags are
letters that indicate the affixes that can be used with this word.  These are
specified with SFX and PFX lines in the .aff file, see |spell-SFX| and
|spell-PFX|.  Vim allows using other flag types with the FLAG item in the
affix file |spell-FLAG|.

When the word only has lower-case letters it will also match with the word
starting with an upper-case letter.

When the word includes an upper-case letter, this means the upper-case letter
is required at this position.  The same word with a lower-case letter at this
position will not match. When some of the other letters are upper-case it will
not match either.

The word with all upper-case characters will always be OK,

	word list	matches			does not match ~
	als		als Als ALS		ALs AlS aLs aLS
	Als		Als  ALS		als ALs AlS aLs aLS
	ALS		ALS			als Als ALs AlS aLs aLS
	AlS		AlS ALS			als Als ALs aLs aLS

The KEEPCASE affix ID can be used to specifically match a word with identical
case only, see below |spell-KEEPCASE|.

Note: in line 5 to 7 non-word characters are used.  You can include any
character in a word.  When checking the text a word still only matches when it
appears with a non-word character before and after it.  For Myspell a word
starting with a non-word character probably won't work.

In line 12 the word "TCP/IP" is defined.  Since the slash has a special
meaning the comma is used instead.  This is defined with the SLASH item in the
affix file, see |spell-SLASH|.  Note that without this SLASH item the word
will be "TCP,IP".


AFFIX FILE FORMAT			*spell-aff-format* *spell-affix-vim*

							*spell-affix-comment*
Comment lines in the .aff file start with a '#':

	# comment line ~

Items with a fixed number of arguments can be followed by a comment.  But only
if none of the arguments can contain white space.  The comment must start with
a "#" character.  Example:

	KEEPCASE =  # fix case for words with this flag ~


ENCODING							*spell-SET*

The affix file can be in any encoding that is supported by "iconv".  However,
in some cases the current locale should also be set properly at the time
|:mkspell| is invoked.  Adding FOL/LOW/UPP lines removes this requirement
|spell-FOL|.

The encoding should be specified before anything where the encoding matters.
The encoding applies both to the affix file and the dictionary file.  It is
done with a SET line:

	SET utf-8 ~

The encoding can be different from the value of the 'encoding' option at the
time ":mkspell" is used.  Vim will then convert everything to 'encoding' and
generate a spell file for 'encoding'.  If some of the used characters to not
fit in 'encoding' you will get an error message.
							*spell-affix-mbyte*
When using a multi-byte encoding it's possible to use more different affix
flags.  But Myspell doesn't support that, thus you may not want to use it
anyway.  For compatibility use an 8-bit encoding.


INFORMATION

These entries in the affix file can be used to add information to the spell
file.  There are no restrictions on the format, but they should be in the
right encoding.

				*spell-NAME* *spell-VERSION* *spell-HOME*
				*spell-AUTHOR* *spell-EMAIL* *spell-COPYRIGHT*
	NAME		Name of the language
	VERSION		1.0.1  with fixes
	HOME		http://www.myhome.eu
	AUTHOR		John Doe
	EMAIL		john AT Doe DOT net
	COPYRIGHT	LGPL

These fields are put in the .spl file as-is.  The |:spellinfo| command can be
used to view the info.

							*:spellinfo* *:spelli*
:spelli[nfo]		Display the information for the spell file(s) used for
			the current buffer.


CHARACTER TABLES
							*spell-affix-chars*
When using an 8-bit encoding the affix file should define what characters are
word characters.  This is because the system where ":mkspell" is used may not
support a locale with this encoding and isalpha() won't work.  For example
when using "cp1250" on Unix.
						*E761* *E762* *spell-FOL*
						*spell-LOW* *spell-UPP*
Three lines in the affix file are needed.  Simplistic example:

	FOL   ~
	LOW   ~
	UPP   ~

All three lines must have exactly the same number of characters.

The "FOL" line specifies the case-folded characters.  These are used to
compare words while ignoring case.  For most encodings this is identical to
the lower case line.

The "LOW" line specifies the characters in lower-case.  Mostly it's equal to
the "FOL" line.

The "UPP" line specifies the characters with upper-case.  That is, a character
is upper-case where it's different from the character at the same position in
"FOL".

An exception is made for the German sharp s .  The upper-case version is
"SS".  In the FOL/LOW/UPP lines it should be included, so that it's recognized
as a word character, but use the  character in all three.

ASCII characters should be omitted, Vim always handles these in the same way.
When the encoding is UTF-8 no word characters need to be specified.

							*E763*
Vim allows you to use spell checking for several languages in the same file.
You can list them in the 'spelllang' option.  As a consequence all spell files
for the same encoding must use the same word characters, otherwise they can't
be combined without errors.

If you get an E763 warning that the word tables differ you need to update your
".spl" spell files.  If you downloaded the files, get the latest version of
all spell files you use.  If you are only using one, e.g., German, then also
download the recent English spell files.  Otherwise generate the .spl file
again with |:mkspell|.  If you still get errors check the FOL, LOW and UPP
lines in the used .aff files.

The XX.ascii.spl spell file generated with the "-ascii" argument will not
contain the table with characters, so that it can be combine with spell files
for any encoding.  The .add.spl files also do not contain the table.


MID-WORD CHARACTERS
							*spell-midword*
Some characters are only to be considered word characters if they are used in
between two ordinary word characters.  An example is the single quote: It is
often used to put text in quotes, thus it can't be recognized as a word
character, but when it appears in between word characters it must be part of
the word.  This is needed to detect a spelling error such as they'are.  That
should be they're, but since "they" and "are" are words themselves that would
go unnoticed.

These characters are defined with MIDWORD in the .aff file.  Example:

	MIDWORD	'- ~


FLAG TYPES						*spell-FLAG*

Flags are used to specify the affixes that can be used with a word and for
other properties of the word.  Normally single-character flags are used.  This
limits the number of possible flags, especially for 8-bit encodings.  The FLAG
item can be used if more affixes are to be used.  Possible values:

	FLAG long	use two-character flags
	FLAG num	use numbers, from 1 up to 65000
	FLAG caplong	use one-character flags without A-Z and two-character
			flags that start with A-Z

With "FLAG num" the numbers in a list of affixes need to be separated with a
comma: "234,2143,1435".  This method is inefficient, but useful if the file is
generated with a program.

When using "caplong" the two-character flags all start with a capital: "Aa",
"B1", "BB", etc.  This is useful to use one-character flags for the most
common items and two-character flags for uncommon items.

Note: When using utf-8 only characters up to 65000 may be used for flags.

Note: even when using "num" or "long" the number of flags available to
compounding and prefixes is limited to about 250.


AFFIXES
					    *spell-PFX* *spell-SFX*
The usual PFX (prefix) and SFX (suffix) lines are supported (see the Myspell
documentation or the Aspell manual:
http://aspell.net/man-html/Affix-Compression.html).

Summary:
	SFX L Y 2 ~
	SFX L 0 re [^x] ~
	SFX L 0 ro x ~

The first line is a header and has four fields:
	SFX {flag} {combine} {count}

{flag}		The name used for the suffix.  Mostly it's a single letter,
		but other characters can be used, see |spell-FLAG|.

{combine}	Can be 'Y' or 'N'.  When 'Y' then the word plus suffix can
		also have a prefix.  When 'N' then a prefix is not allowed.

{count}		The number of lines following.  If this is wrong you will get
		an error message.

For PFX the fields are exactly the same.

The basic format for the following lines is:
	SFX {flag} {strip} {add} {condition} {extra}

{flag}		Must be the same as the {flag} used in the first line.

{strip}		Characters removed from the basic word.  There is no check if
		the characters are actually there, only the length is used (in
		bytes).  This better match the {condition}, otherwise strange
		things may happen.  If the {strip} length is equal to or
		longer than the basic word the suffix won't be used.
		When {strip} is 0 (zero) then nothing is stripped.

{add}		Characters added to the basic word, after removing {strip}.
		Optionally there is a '/' followed by flags.  The flags apply
		to the word plus affix.  See |spell-affix-flags|

{condition}	A simplistic pattern.  Only when this matches with a basic
		word will the suffix be used for that word.  This is normally
		for using one suffix letter with different {add} and {strip}
		fields for words with different endings.
		When {condition} is a . (dot) there is no condition.
		The pattern may contain:
		- Literal characters.
		- A set of characters in []. [abc] matches a, b and c.
		  A dash is allowed for a range [a-c], but this is
		  Vim-specific.
		- A set of characters that starts with a ^, meaning the
		  complement of the specified characters. [^abc] matches any
		  character but a, b and c.

{extra}		Optional extra text:
		    # comment		Comment is ignored
		    -			Hunspell uses this, ignored

For PFX the fields are the same, but the {strip}, {add} and {condition} apply
to the start of the word.

Note: Myspell ignores any extra text after the relevant info.  Vim requires
this text to start with a "#" so that mistakes don't go unnoticed.  Example:

	SFX F 0 in   [^i]n      # Spion > Spionin  ~
	SFX F 0 nen  in		# Bauerin > Bauerinnen ~

However, to avoid lots of errors in affix files written for Myspell, you can
add the IGNOREEXTRA flag.

Apparently Myspell allows an affix name to appear more than once.  Since this
might also be a mistake, Vim checks for an extra "S".  The affix files for
Myspell that use this feature apparently have this flag.  Example:

	SFX a Y 1 S ~
	SFX a 0 an . ~

	SFX a Y 2 S ~
	SFX a 0 en . ~
	SFX a 0 on . ~


AFFIX FLAGS						*spell-affix-flags*

This is a feature that comes from Hunspell: The affix may specify flags.  This
works similar to flags specified on a basic word.  The flags apply to the
basic word plus the affix (but there are restrictions).  Example:

	SFX S Y 1 ~
	SFX S 0 s . ~

	SFX A Y 1 ~
	SFX A 0 able/S . ~

When the dictionary file contains "drink/AS" then these words are possible:

	drink
	drinks		uses S suffix
	drinkable	uses A suffix
	drinkables	uses A suffix and then S suffix

Generally the flags of the suffix are added to the flags of the basic word,
both are used for the word plus suffix.  But the flags of the basic word are
only used once for affixes, except that both one prefix and one suffix can be
used when both support combining.

Specifically, the affix flags can be used for:
- Suffixes on suffixes, as in the example above.  This works once, thus you
  can have two suffixes on a word (plus one prefix).
- Making the word with the affix rare, by using the |spell-RARE| flag.
- Exclude the word with the affix from compounding, by using the
  |spell-COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG| flag.
- Allow the word with the affix to be part of a compound word on the side of
  the affix with the |spell-COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG|.
- Use the NEEDCOMPOUND flag: word plus affix can only be used as part of a
  compound word. |spell-NEEDCOMPOUND|
- Compound flags: word plus affix can be part of a compound word at the end,
  middle, start, etc.  The flags are combined with the flags of the basic
  word.  |spell-compound|
- NEEDAFFIX: another affix is needed to make a valid word.
- CIRCUMFIX, as explained just below.


IGNOREEXTRA						*spell-IGNOREEXTRA*

Normally Vim gives an error for an extra field that does not start with '#'.
This avoids errors going unnoticed.  However, some files created for Myspell
or Hunspell may contain many entries with an extra field.  Use the IGNOREEXTRA
flag to avoid lots of errors.


CIRCUMFIX						*spell-CIRCUMFIX*

The CIRCUMFIX flag means a prefix and suffix must be added at the same time.
If a prefix has the CIRCUMFIX flag than only suffixes with the CIRCUMFIX flag
can be added, and the other way around.
An alternative is to only specify the suffix, and give the that suffix two
flags: The required prefix and the NEEDAFFIX flag.  |spell-NEEDAFFIX|


PFXPOSTPONE						*spell-PFXPOSTPONE*

When an affix file has very many prefixes that apply to many words it's not
possible to build the whole word list in memory.  This applies to Hebrew (a
list with all words is over a Gbyte).  In that case applying prefixes must be
postponed.  This makes spell checking slower.  It is indicated by this keyword
in the .aff file:

	PFXPOSTPONE ~

Only prefixes without a chop string and without flags can be postponed.
Prefixes with a chop string or with flags will still be included in the word
list.  An exception if the chop string is one character and equal to the last
character of the added string, but in lower case.  Thus when the chop string
is used to allow the following word to start with an upper case letter.


WORDS WITH A SLASH					*spell-SLASH*

The slash is used in the .dic file to separate the basic word from the affix
letters and other flags.  Unfortunately, this means you cannot use a slash in
a word.  Thus "TCP/IP" is not a word but "TCP" with the flags "IP".  To include
a slash in the word put a backslash before it: "TCP\/IP".  In the rare case
you want to use a backslash inside a word you need to use two backslashes.
Any other use of the backslash is reserved for future expansion.


KEEP-CASE WORDS						*spell-KEEPCASE*

In the affix file a KEEPCASE line can be used to define the affix name used
for keep-case words.  Example:

	KEEPCASE = ~

This flag is not supported by Myspell.  It has the meaning that case matters.
This can be used if the word does not have the first letter in upper case at
the start of a sentence.  Example:

    word list	    matches		    does not match ~
    's morgens/=    's morgens		    'S morgens 's Morgens 'S MORGENS
    's Morgens	    's Morgens 'S MORGENS   'S morgens 's morgens

The flag can also be used to avoid that the word matches when it is in all
upper-case letters.


RARE WORDS						*spell-RARE*

In the affix file a RARE line can be used to define the affix name used for
rare words.  Example:

	RARE ? ~

Rare words are highlighted differently from bad words.  This is to be used for
words that are correct for the language, but are hardly ever used and could be
a typing mistake anyway.

This flag can also be used on an affix, so that a basic word is not rare but
the basic word plus affix is rare |spell-affix-flags|.  However, if the word
also appears as a good word in another way (e.g., in another region) it won't
be marked as rare.


BAD WORDS						*spell-BAD*

In the affix file a BAD line can be used to define the affix name used for
bad words.  Example:

	BAD ! ~

This can be used to exclude words that would otherwise be good.  For example
"the the" in the .dic file:

	the the/! ~

Once a word has been marked as bad it won't be undone by encountering the same
word as good.

The flag also applies to the word with affixes, thus this can be used to mark
a whole bunch of related words as bad.

							*spell-FORBIDDENWORD*
FORBIDDENWORD can be used just like BAD.  For compatibility with Hunspell.

							*spell-NEEDAFFIX*
The NEEDAFFIX flag is used to require that a word is used with an affix.  The
word itself is not a good word (unless there is an empty affix).  Example:

	NEEDAFFIX + ~


COMPOUND WORDS						*spell-compound*

A compound word is a longer word made by concatenating words that appear in
the .dic file.  To specify which words may be concatenated a character is
used.  This character is put in the list of affixes after the word.  We will
call this character a flag here.  Obviously these flags must be different from
any affix IDs used.

							*spell-COMPOUNDFLAG*
The Myspell compatible method uses one flag, specified with COMPOUNDFLAG.  All
words with this flag combine in any order.  This means there is no control
over which word comes first.  Example:
	COMPOUNDFLAG c ~

							*spell-COMPOUNDRULE*
A more advanced method to specify how compound words can be formed uses
multiple items with multiple flags.  This is not compatible with Myspell 3.0.
Let's start with an example:
	COMPOUNDRULE c+ ~
	COMPOUNDRULE se ~

The first line defines that words with the "c" flag can be concatenated in any
order.  The second line defines compound words that are made of one word with
the "s" flag and one word with the "e" flag.  With this dictionary:
	bork/c ~
	onion/s ~
	soup/e ~

You can make these words:
	bork
	borkbork
	borkborkbork
	(etc.)
	onion
	soup
	onionsoup

The COMPOUNDRULE item may appear multiple times.  The argument is made out of
one or more groups, where each group can be:
	one flag			e.g., c
	alternate flags inside []	e.g., [abc]
Optionally this may be followed by:
	*	the group appears zero or more times, e.g., sm*e
	+	the group appears one or more times, e.g., c+
	?	the group appears zero times or once, e.g., x?

This is similar to the regexp pattern syntax (but not the same!).  A few
examples with the sequence of word flags they require:
    COMPOUNDRULE x+	    x xx xxx etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE yz	    yz
    COMPOUNDRULE x+z	    xz xxz xxxz etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE yx+	    yx yxx yxxx etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE xy?z	    xz xyz

    COMPOUNDRULE [abc]z    az bz cz
    COMPOUNDRULE [abc]+z   az aaz abaz bz baz bcbz cz caz cbaz etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE a[xyz]+   ax axx axyz ay ayx ayzz az azy azxy etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE sm*e	    se sme smme smmme etc.
    COMPOUNDRULE s[xyz]*e  se sxe sxye sxyxe sye syze sze szye szyxe  etc.

A specific example: Allow a compound to be made of two words and a dash:
	In the .aff file:
	    COMPOUNDRULE sde ~
	    NEEDAFFIX x ~
	    COMPOUNDWORDMAX 3 ~
	    COMPOUNDMIN 1 ~
	In the .dic file:
	    start/s ~
	    end/e ~
	    -/xd ~

This allows for the word "start-end", but not "startend".

An additional implied rule is that, without further flags, a word with a
prefix cannot be compounded after another word, and a word with a suffix
cannot be compounded with a following word.  Thus the affix cannot appear
on the inside of a compound word.  This can be changed with the
|spell-COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG|.

							*spell-NEEDCOMPOUND*
The NEEDCOMPOUND flag is used to require that a word is used as part of a
compound word.  The word itself is not a good word.  Example:

	NEEDCOMPOUND & ~

							*spell-ONLYINCOMPOUND*
The ONLYINCOMPOUND does exactly the same as NEEDCOMPOUND.  Supported for
compatibility with Hunspell.

							*spell-COMPOUNDMIN*
The minimal character length of a word used for compounding is specified with
COMPOUNDMIN.  Example:
	COMPOUNDMIN 5 ~

When omitted there is no minimal length.  Obviously you could just leave out
the compound flag from short words instead, this feature is present for
compatibility with Myspell.

							*spell-COMPOUNDWORDMAX*
The maximum number of words that can be concatenated into a compound word is
specified with COMPOUNDWORDMAX.  Example:
	COMPOUNDWORDMAX 3 ~

When omitted there is no maximum.  It applies to all compound words.

To set a limit for words with specific flags make sure the items in
COMPOUNDRULE where they appear don't allow too many words.

							*spell-COMPOUNDSYLMAX*
The maximum number of syllables that a compound word may contain is specified
with COMPOUNDSYLMAX.  Example:
	COMPOUNDSYLMAX 6 ~

This has no effect if there is no SYLLABLE item.  Without COMPOUNDSYLMAX there
is no limit on the number of syllables.

If both COMPOUNDWORDMAX and COMPOUNDSYLMAX are defined, a compound word is
accepted if it fits one of the criteria, thus is either made from up to
COMPOUNDWORDMAX words or contains up to COMPOUNDSYLMAX syllables.

						    *spell-COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG*
The COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG specifies a flag that can be used on an affix.  It
means that the word plus affix cannot be used in a compound word.  Example:
	affix file:
		COMPOUNDFLAG c ~
		COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG x ~
		SFX a Y 2 ~
		SFX a 0 s   . ~
		SFX a 0 ize/x . ~
	dictionary:
		word/c ~
		util/ac ~

This allows for "wordutil" and "wordutils" but not "wordutilize".
Note: this doesn't work for postponed prefixes yet.

						    *spell-COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG*
The COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG specifies a flag that can be used on an affix.  It
means that the word plus affix can also be used in a compound word in a way
where the affix ends up halfway through the word.  Without this flag that is
not allowed.
Note: this doesn't work for postponed prefixes yet.

						    *spell-COMPOUNDROOT*
The COMPOUNDROOT flag is used for words in the dictionary that are already a
compound.  This means it counts for two words when checking the compounding
rules.  Can also be used for an affix to count the affix as a compounding
word.

						*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN*
CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN is used to define patterns that, when matching at the
position where two words are compounded together forbids the compound.
For example:
	CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN o e ~

This forbids compounding if the first word ends in "o" and the second word
starts with "e".

The arguments must be plain text, no patterns are actually supported, despite
the item name.  Case is always ignored.

The Hunspell feature to use three arguments and flags is not supported.

							*spell-NOCOMPOUNDSUGS*
This item indicates that using compounding to make suggestions is not a good
idea.  Use this when compounding is used with very short or one-character
words.  E.g. to make numbers out of digits.  Without this flag creating
suggestions would spend most time trying all kind of weird compound words.

	NOCOMPOUNDSUGS ~

							*spell-SYLLABLE*
The SYLLABLE item defines characters or character sequences that are used to
count the number of syllables in a word.  Example:
	SYLLABLE aeiouy/aa/au/ea/ee/ei/ie/oa/oe/oo/ou/uu/ui ~

Before the first slash is the set of characters that are counted for one
syllable, also when repeated and mixed, until the next character that is not
in this set.  After the slash come sequences of characters that are counted
for one syllable.  These are preferred over using characters from the set.
With the example "ideeen" has three syllables, counted by "i", "ee" and "e".

Only case-folded letters need to be included.

Another way to restrict compounding was mentioned above: Adding the
|spell-COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG| flag to an affix causes all words that are made
with that affix to not be used for compounding.


UNLIMITED COMPOUNDING					*spell-NOBREAK*

For some languages, such as Thai, there is no space in between words.  This
looks like all words are compounded.  To specify this use the NOBREAK item in
the affix file, without arguments:
	NOBREAK ~

Vim will try to figure out where one word ends and a next starts.  When there
are spelling mistakes this may not be quite right.


							*spell-COMMON*
Common words can be specified with the COMMON item.  This will give better
suggestions when editing a short file.  Example:

	COMMON  the of to and a in is it you that he was for on are ~

The words must be separated by white space, up to 25 per line.
When multiple regions are specified in a ":mkspell" command the common words
for all regions are combined and used for all regions.

							*spell-NOSPLITSUGS*
This item indicates that splitting a word to make suggestions is not a good
idea.  Split-word suggestions will appear only when there are few similar
words.

	NOSPLITSUGS ~

							*spell-NOSUGGEST*
The flag specified with NOSUGGEST can be used for words that will not be
suggested.  Can be used for obscene words.

	NOSUGGEST % ~


REPLACEMENTS						*spell-REP*

In the affix file REP items can be used to define common mistakes.  This is
used to make spelling suggestions.  The items define the "from" text and the
"to" replacement.  Example:

	REP 4 ~
	REP f ph ~
	REP ph f ~
	REP k ch ~
	REP ch k ~

The first line specifies the number of REP lines following.  Vim ignores the
number, but it must be there (for compatibility with Myspell).

Don't include simple one-character replacements or swaps.  Vim will try these
anyway.  You can include whole words if you want to, but you might want to use
the "file:" item in 'spellsuggest' instead.

You can include a space by using an underscore:

	REP the_the the ~


SIMILAR CHARACTERS					*spell-MAP* *E783*

In the affix file MAP items can be used to define letters that are very much
alike.  This is mostly used for a letter with different accents.  This is used
to prefer suggestions with these letters substituted.  Example:

	MAP 2 ~
	MAP e ~
	MAP u ~

The first line specifies the number of MAP lines following.  Vim ignores the
number, but the line must be there.

Each letter must appear in only one of the MAP items.  It's a bit more
efficient if the first letter is ASCII or at least one without accents.


.SUG FILE						*spell-NOSUGFILE*

When soundfolding is specified in the affix file then ":mkspell" will normally
produce a .sug file next to the .spl file.  This file is used to find
suggestions by their sound-a-like form quickly.  At the cost of a lot of
memory (the amount depends on the number of words, |:mkspell| will display an
estimate when it's done).

To avoid producing a .sug file use this item in the affix file:

	NOSUGFILE ~

Users can simply omit the .sug file if they don't want to use it.


SOUND-A-LIKE						*spell-SAL*

In the affix file SAL items can be used to define the sounds-a-like mechanism
to be used.  The main items define the "from" text and the "to" replacement.
Simplistic example:

	SAL CIA			 X ~
	SAL CH			 X ~
	SAL C			 K ~
	SAL K			 K ~

There are a few rules and this can become quite complicated.  An explanation
how it works can be found in the Aspell manual:
http://aspell.net/man-html/Phonetic-Code.html.

There are a few special items:

	SAL followup		true ~
	SAL collapse_result	true ~
	SAL remove_accents	true ~

"1" has the same meaning as "true".  Any other value means "false".


SIMPLE SOUNDFOLDING				*spell-SOFOFROM* *spell-SOFOTO*

The SAL mechanism is complex and slow.  A simpler mechanism is mapping all
characters to another character, mapping similar sounding characters to the
same character.  At the same time this does case folding.  You can not have
both SAL items and simple soundfolding.

There are two items required: one to specify the characters that are mapped
and one that specifies the characters they are mapped to.  They must have
exactly the same number of characters.  Example:

    SOFOFROM abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ~
    SOFOTO   ebctefghejklnnepkrstevvkesebctefghejklnnepkrstevvkes ~

In the example all vowels are mapped to the same character 'e'.  Another
method would be to leave out all vowels.  Some characters that sound nearly
the same and are often mixed up, such as 'm' and 'n', are mapped to the same
character.  Don't do this too much, all words will start looking alike.

Characters that do not appear in SOFOFROM will be left out, except that all
white space is replaced by one space.  Sequences of the same character in
SOFOFROM are replaced by one.

You can use the |soundfold()| function to try out the results.  Or set the
'verbose' option to see the score in the output of the |z=| command.


UNSUPPORTED ITEMS				*spell-affix-not-supported*

These items appear in the affix file of other spell checkers.  In Vim they are
ignored, not supported or defined in another way.

ACCENT		(Hunspell)				*spell-ACCENT*
		Use MAP instead. |spell-MAP|

BREAK		(Hunspell)				*spell-BREAK*
		Define break points.  Unclear how it works exactly.
		Not supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE*
		Disallow uppercase letters at compound word boundaries.
		Not supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDDUP  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDDUP*
		Disallow using the same word twice in a compound.  Not
		supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDREP  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDREP*
		Something about using REP items and compound words.  Not
		supported.

CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE  (Hunspell)			*spell-CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE*
		Forbid three identical characters when compounding.  Not
		supported.

COMPLEXPREFIXES  (Hunspell)				*spell-COMPLEXPREFIXES*
		Enables using two prefixes.  Not supported.

COMPOUND	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUND*
		This is one line with the count of COMPOUND items, followed by
		that many COMPOUND lines with a pattern.
		Remove the first line with the count and rename the other
		items to COMPOUNDRULE |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDFIRST	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDFIRST*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDBEGIN	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDBEGIN*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDEND	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDEND*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDMIDDLE	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDMIDDLE*
		Use COMPOUNDRULE instead. |spell-COMPOUNDRULE|

COMPOUNDRULES	(Hunspell)				*spell-COMPOUNDRULES*
		Number of COMPOUNDRULE lines following.  Ignored, but the
		argument must be a number.

COMPOUNDSYLLABLE  (Hunspell)			*spell-COMPOUNDSYLLABLE*
		Use SYLLABLE and COMPOUNDSYLMAX instead. |spell-SYLLABLE|
		|spell-COMPOUNDSYLMAX|

KEY		(Hunspell)				*spell-KEY*
		Define characters that are close together on the keyboard.
		Used to give better suggestions.  Not supported.
		
LANG		(Hunspell)				*spell-LANG*
		This specifies language-specific behavior.  This actually
		moves part of the language knowledge into the program,
		therefore Vim does not support it.  Each language property
		must be specified separately.

LEMMA_PRESENT	(Hunspell)				*spell-LEMMA_PRESENT*
		Only needed for morphological analysis.

MAXNGRAMSUGS	(Hunspell)				*spell-MAXNGRAMSUGS*
		Set number of n-gram suggestions.  Not supported.

PSEUDOROOT	(Hunspell)				*spell-PSEUDOROOT*
		Use NEEDAFFIX instead. |spell-NEEDAFFIX|

SUGSWITHDOTS	(Hunspell)				*spell-SUGSWITHDOTS*
		Adds dots to suggestions.  Vim doesn't need this.

SYLLABLENUM	(Hunspell)				*spell-SYLLABLENUM*
		Not supported.

TRY		(Myspell, Hunspell, others)		*spell-TRY*
		Vim does not use the TRY item, it is ignored.  For making
		suggestions the actual characters in the words are used, that
		is much more efficient.

WORDCHARS	(Hunspell)				*spell-WORDCHARS*
		Used to recognize words.  Vim doesn't need it, because there
		is no need to separate words before checking them (using a
		trie instead of a hashtable).

==============================================================================
5. Spell checker design					*develop-spell*

When spell checking was going to be added to Vim a survey was done over the
available spell checking libraries and programs.  Unfortunately, the result
was that none of them provided sufficient capabilities to be used as the spell
checking engine in Vim, for various reasons:

- Missing support for multi-byte encodings.  At least UTF-8 must be supported,
  so that more than one language can be used in the same file.
  Doing on-the-fly conversion is not always possible (would require iconv
  support).
- For the programs and libraries: Using them as-is would require installing
  them separately from Vim.  That's mostly not impossible, but a drawback.
- Performance: A few tests showed that it's possible to check spelling on the
  fly (while redrawing), just like syntax highlighting.  But the mechanisms
  used by other code are much slower.  Myspell uses a hashtable, for example.
  The affix compression that most spell checkers use makes it slower too.
- For using an external program like aspell a communication mechanism would
  have to be setup.  That's complicated to do in a portable way (Unix-only
  would be relatively simple, but that's not good enough).  And performance
  will become a problem (lots of process switching involved).
- Missing support for words with non-word characters, such as "Etten-Leur" and
  "et al.", would require marking the pieces of them OK, lowering the
  reliability.
- Missing support for regions or dialects.  Makes it difficult to accept
  all English words and highlight non-Canadian words differently.
- Missing support for rare words.  Many words are correct but hardly ever used
  and could be a misspelled often-used word.
- For making suggestions the speed is less important and requiring to install
  another program or library would be acceptable.  But the word lists probably
  differ, the suggestions may be wrong words.


Spelling suggestions				*develop-spell-suggestions*

For making suggestions there are two basic mechanisms:
1. Try changing the bad word a little bit and check for a match with a good
   word.  Or go through the list of good words, change them a little bit and
   check for a match with the bad word.  The changes are deleting a character,
   inserting a character, swapping two characters, etc.
2. Perform soundfolding on both the bad word and the good words and then find
   matches, possibly with a few changes like with the first mechanism.

The first is good for finding typing mistakes.  After experimenting with
hashtables and looking at solutions from other spell checkers the conclusion
was that a trie (a kind of tree structure) is ideal for this.  Both for
reducing memory use and being able to try sensible changes.  For example, when
inserting a character only characters that lead to good words need to be
tried.  Other mechanisms (with hashtables) need to try all possible letters at
every position in the word.  Also, a hashtable has the requirement that word
boundaries are identified separately, while a trie does not require this.
That makes the mechanism a lot simpler.

Soundfolding is useful when someone knows how the words sounds but doesn't
know how it is spelled.  For example, the word "dictionary" might be written
as "daktonerie".  The number of changes that the first method would need to
try is very big, it's hard to find the good word that way.  After soundfolding
the words become "tktnr" and "tkxnry", these differ by only two letters.

To find words by their soundfolded equivalent (soundalike word) we need a list
of all soundfolded words.  A few experiments have been done to find out what
the best method is.  Alternatives:
1. Do the sound folding on the fly when looking for suggestions.  This means
   walking through the trie of good words, soundfolding each word and
   checking how different it is from the bad word.  This is very efficient for
   memory use, but takes a long time.  On a fast PC it takes a couple of
   seconds for English, which can be acceptable for interactive use.  But for
   some languages it takes more than ten seconds (e.g., German, Catalan),
   which is unacceptable slow.  For batch processing (automatic corrections)
   it's too slow for all languages.
2. Use a trie for the soundfolded words, so that searching can be done just
   like how it works without soundfolding.  This requires remembering a list
   of good words for each soundfolded word.  This makes finding matches very
   fast but requires quite a lot of memory, in the order of 1 to 10 Mbyte.
   For some languages more than the original word list.
3. Like the second alternative, but reduce the amount of memory by using affix
   compression and store only the soundfolded basic word.  This is what Aspell
   does.  Disadvantage is that affixes need to be stripped from the bad word
   before soundfolding it, which means that mistakes at the start and/or end
   of the word will cause the mechanism to fail.  Also, this becomes slow when
   the bad word is quite different from the good word.

The choice made is to use the second mechanism and use a separate file.  This
way a user with sufficient memory can get very good suggestions while a user
who is short of memory or just wants the spell checking and no suggestions
doesn't use so much memory.


Word frequency

For sorting suggestions it helps to know which words are common.  In theory we
could store a word frequency with the word in the dictionary.  However, this
requires storing a count per word.  That degrades word tree compression a lot.
And maintaining the word frequency for all languages will be a heavy task.
Also, it would be nice to prefer words that are already in the text.  This way
the words that appear in the specific text are preferred for suggestions.

What has been implemented is to count words that have been seen during
displaying.  A hashtable is used to quickly find the word count.  The count is
initialized from words listed in COMMON items in the affix file, so that it
also works when starting a new file.

This isn't ideal, because the longer Vim is running the higher the counts
become.  But in practice it is a noticeable improvement over not using the word
count.

Syntax highlighting		*syntax* *syntax-highlighting* *coloring*

Syntax highlighting enables Vim to show parts of the text in another font or
color.	Those parts can be specific keywords or text matching a pattern.  Vim
doesn't parse the whole file (to keep it fast), so the highlighting has its
limitations.  Lexical highlighting might be a better name, but since everybody
calls it syntax highlighting we'll stick with that.

Vim supports syntax highlighting on all terminals.  But since most ordinary
terminals have very limited highlighting possibilities, it works best in the
GUI version, gvim.

In the User Manual:
|usr_06.txt| introduces syntax highlighting.
|usr_44.txt| introduces writing a syntax file.

==============================================================================
1. Quick start						*:syn-qstart*

						*:syn-enable* *:syntax-enable*
This command switches on syntax highlighting: >

	:syntax enable

What this command actually does is to execute the command >
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim

If the VIM environment variable is not set, Vim will try to find
the path in another way (see |$VIMRUNTIME|).  Usually this works just
fine.  If it doesn't, try setting the VIM environment variable to the
directory where the Vim stuff is located.  For example, if your syntax files
are in the "/usr/vim/vim50/syntax" directory, set $VIMRUNTIME to
"/usr/vim/vim50".  You must do this in the shell, before starting Vim.

							*:syn-on* *:syntax-on*
The ":syntax enable" command will keep your current color settings.  This
allows using ":highlight" commands to set your preferred colors before or
after using this command.  If you want Vim to overrule your settings with the
defaults, use: >
	:syntax on
<
					*:hi-normal* *:highlight-normal*
If you are running in the GUI, you can get white text on a black background
with: >
	:highlight Normal guibg=Black guifg=White
For a color terminal see |:hi-normal-cterm|.
For setting up your own colors syntax highlighting see |syncolor|.

NOTE: The syntax files on Windows have lines that end in <CR><NL>.  The files
for Unix end in <NL>.  This means you should use the right type of file for
your system.  Although on Windows the right format is automatically selected
if the 'fileformats' option is not empty.

NOTE: When using reverse video ("gvim -fg white -bg black"), the default value
of 'background' will not be set until the GUI window is opened, which is after
reading the |gvimrc|.  This will cause the wrong default highlighting to be
used.  To set the default value of 'background' before switching on
highlighting, include the ":gui" command in the |gvimrc|: >

   :gui		" open window and set default for 'background'
   :syntax on	" start highlighting, use 'background' to set colors

NOTE: Using ":gui" in the |gvimrc| means that "gvim -f" won't start in the
foreground!  Use ":gui -f" then.

							*g:syntax_on*
You can toggle the syntax on/off with this command: >
   :if exists("g:syntax_on") | syntax off | else | syntax enable | endif

To put this into a mapping, you can use: >
   :map <F7> :if exists("g:syntax_on") <Bar>
	\   syntax off <Bar>
	\ else <Bar>
	\   syntax enable <Bar>
	\ endif <CR>
[using the |<>| notation, type this literally]

Details:
The ":syntax" commands are implemented by sourcing a file.  To see exactly how
this works, look in the file:
    command		file ~
    :syntax enable	$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim
    :syntax on		$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim
    :syntax manual	$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/manual.vim
    :syntax off		$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/nosyntax.vim
Also see |syntax-loading|.

NOTE: If displaying long lines is slow and switching off syntax highlighting
makes it fast, consider setting the 'synmaxcol' option to a lower value.

==============================================================================
2. Syntax files						*:syn-files*

The syntax and highlighting commands for one language are normally stored in
a syntax file.	The name convention is: "{name}.vim".  Where {name} is the
name of the language, or an abbreviation (to fit the name in 8.3 characters,
a requirement in case the file is used on a DOS filesystem).
Examples:
	c.vim		perl.vim	java.vim	html.vim
	cpp.vim		sh.vim		csh.vim

The syntax file can contain any Ex commands, just like a vimrc file.  But
the idea is that only commands for a specific language are included.  When a
language is a superset of another language, it may include the other one,
for example, the cpp.vim file could include the c.vim file: >
   :so $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/c.vim

The .vim files are normally loaded with an autocommand.  For example: >
   :au Syntax c	    runtime! syntax/c.vim
   :au Syntax cpp   runtime! syntax/cpp.vim
These commands are normally in the file $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/synload.vim.


MAKING YOUR OWN SYNTAX FILES				*mysyntaxfile*

When you create your own syntax files, and you want to have Vim use these
automatically with ":syntax enable", do this:

1. Create your user runtime directory.	You would normally use the first item
   of the 'runtimepath' option.  Example for Unix: >
	mkdir ~/.config/nvim

2. Create a directory in there called "syntax".  For Unix: >
	mkdir ~/.config/nvim/syntax

3. Write the Vim syntax file.  Or download one from the internet.  Then write
   it in your syntax directory.  For example, for the "mine" syntax: >
	:w ~/.config/nvim/syntax/mine.vim

Now you can start using your syntax file manually: >
	:set syntax=mine
You don't have to exit Vim to use this.

If you also want Vim to detect the type of file, see |new-filetype|.

If you are setting up a system with many users and you don't want each user
to add the same syntax file, you can use another directory from 'runtimepath'.


ADDING TO AN EXISTING SYNTAX FILE		*mysyntaxfile-add*

If you are mostly satisfied with an existing syntax file, but would like to
add a few items or change the highlighting, follow these steps:

1. Create your user directory from 'runtimepath', see above.

2. Create a directory in there called "after/syntax".  For Unix: >
	mkdir ~/.config/nvim/after
	mkdir ~/.config/nvim/after/syntax

3. Write a Vim script that contains the commands you want to use.  For
   example, to change the colors for the C syntax: >
	highlight cComment ctermfg=Green guifg=Green

4. Write that file in the "after/syntax" directory.  Use the name of the
   syntax, with ".vim" added.  For our C syntax: >
	:w ~/.config/nvim/after/syntax/c.vim

That's it.  The next time you edit a C file the Comment color will be
different.  You don't even have to restart Vim.

If you have multiple files, you can use the filetype as the directory name.
All the "*.vim" files in this directory will be used, for example:
	~/.config/nvim/after/syntax/c/one.vim
	~/.config/nvim/after/syntax/c/two.vim


REPLACING AN EXISTING SYNTAX FILE			*mysyntaxfile-replace*

If you don't like a distributed syntax file, or you have downloaded a new
version, follow the same steps as for |mysyntaxfile| above.  Just make sure
that you write the syntax file in a directory that is early in 'runtimepath'.
Vim will only load the first syntax file found, assuming that it sets
b:current_syntax.


NAMING CONVENTIONS		    *group-name* *{group-name}* *E669* *W18*

A syntax group name is to be used for syntax items that match the same kind of
thing.  These are then linked to a highlight group that specifies the color.
A syntax group name doesn't specify any color or attributes itself.

The name for a highlight or syntax group must consist of ASCII letters, digits
and the underscore.  As a regexp: "[a-zA-Z0-9_]*".  However, Vim does not give
an error when using other characters.

To be able to allow each user to pick his favorite set of colors, there must
be preferred names for highlight groups that are common for many languages.
These are the suggested group names (if syntax highlighting works properly
you can see the actual color, except for "Ignore"):

	*Comment	any comment

	*Constant	any constant
	 String		a string constant: "this is a string"
	 Character	a character constant: 'c', '\n'
	 Number		a number constant: 234, 0xff
	 Boolean	a boolean constant: TRUE, false
	 Float		a floating point constant: 2.3e10

	*Identifier	any variable name
	 Function	function name (also: methods for classes)

	*Statement	any statement
	 Conditional	if, then, else, endif, switch, etc.
	 Repeat		for, do, while, etc.
	 Label		case, default, etc.
	 Operator	"sizeof", "+", "*", etc.
	 Keyword	any other keyword
	 Exception	try, catch, throw

	*PreProc	generic Preprocessor
	 Include	preprocessor #include
	 Define		preprocessor #define
	 Macro		same as Define
	 PreCondit	preprocessor #if, #else, #endif, etc.

	*Type		int, long, char, etc.
	 StorageClass	static, register, volatile, etc.
	 Structure	struct, union, enum, etc.
	 Typedef	A typedef

	*Special	any special symbol
	 SpecialChar	special character in a constant
	 Tag		you can use CTRL-] on this
	 Delimiter	character that needs attention
	 SpecialComment	special things inside a comment
	 Debug		debugging statements

	*Underlined	text that stands out, HTML links

	*Ignore		left blank, hidden  |hl-Ignore|

	*Error		any erroneous construct

	*Todo		anything that needs extra attention; mostly the
			keywords TODO FIXME and XXX

The names marked with * are the preferred groups; the others are minor groups.
For the preferred groups, the "syntax.vim" file contains default highlighting.
The minor groups are linked to the preferred groups, so they get the same
highlighting.  You can override these defaults by using ":highlight" commands
after sourcing the "syntax.vim" file.

Note that highlight group names are not case sensitive.  "String" and "string"
can be used for the same group.

The following names are reserved and cannot be used as a group name:
	NONE   ALL   ALLBUT   contains	 contained

							*hl-Ignore*
When using the Ignore group, you may also consider using the conceal
mechanism.  See |conceal|.

==============================================================================
3. Syntax loading procedure				*syntax-loading*

This explains the details that happen when the command ":syntax enable" is
issued.  When Vim initializes itself, it finds out where the runtime files are
located.  This is used here as the variable |$VIMRUNTIME|.

":syntax enable" and ":syntax on" do the following:

    Source $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim
    |
    +-	Clear out any old syntax by sourcing $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/nosyntax.vim
    |
    +-	Source first syntax/synload.vim in 'runtimepath'
    |	|
    |	+-  Setup the colors for syntax highlighting.  If a color scheme is
    |	|   defined it is loaded again with ":colors {name}".  Otherwise
    |	|   ":runtime! syntax/syncolor.vim" is used.  ":syntax on" overrules
    |	|   existing colors, ":syntax enable" only sets groups that weren't
    |	|   set yet.
    |	|
    |	+-  Set up syntax autocmds to load the appropriate syntax file when
    |	|   the 'syntax' option is set. *synload-1*
    |	|
    |	+-  Source the user's optional file, from the |mysyntaxfile| variable.
    |	    This is for backwards compatibility with Vim 5.x only. *synload-2*
    |
    +-	Do ":filetype on", which does ":runtime! filetype.vim".  It loads any
    |	filetype.vim files found.  It should always Source
    |	$VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim, which does the following.
    |	|
    |	+-  Install autocmds based on suffix to set the 'filetype' option
    |	|   This is where the connection between file name and file type is
    |	|   made for known file types. *synload-3*
    |	|
    |	+-  Source the user's optional file, from the *myfiletypefile*
    |	|   variable.  This is for backwards compatibility with Vim 5.x only.
    |	|   *synload-4*
    |	|
    |	+-  Install one autocommand which sources scripts.vim when no file
    |	|   type was detected yet. *synload-5*
    |	|
    |	+-  Source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim, to setup the Syntax menu. |menu.vim|
    |
    +-	Install a FileType autocommand to set the 'syntax' option when a file
    |	type has been detected. *synload-6*
    |
    +-	Execute syntax autocommands to start syntax highlighting for each
	already loaded buffer.


Upon loading a file, Vim finds the relevant syntax file as follows:

    Loading the file triggers the BufReadPost autocommands.
    |
    +-	If there is a match with one of the autocommands from |synload-3|
    |	(known file types) or |synload-4| (user's file types), the 'filetype'
    |	option is set to the file type.
    |
    +-	The autocommand at |synload-5| is triggered.  If the file type was not
    |	found yet, then scripts.vim is searched for in 'runtimepath'.  This
    |	should always load $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim, which does the following.
    |	|
    |	+-  Source the user's optional file, from the *myscriptsfile*
    |	|   variable.  This is for backwards compatibility with Vim 5.x only.
    |	|
    |	+-  If the file type is still unknown, check the contents of the file,
    |	    again with checks like "getline(1) =~ pattern" as to whether the
    |	    file type can be recognized, and set 'filetype'.
    |
    +-	When the file type was determined and 'filetype' was set, this
    |	triggers the FileType autocommand |synload-6| above.  It sets
    |	'syntax' to the determined file type.
    |
    +-	When the 'syntax' option was set above, this triggers an autocommand
    |	from |synload-1| (and |synload-2|).  This find the main syntax file in
    |	'runtimepath', with this command:
    |		runtime! syntax/<name>.vim
    |
    +-	Any other user installed FileType or Syntax autocommands are
	triggered.  This can be used to change the highlighting for a specific
	syntax.

==============================================================================
4. Syntax file remarks					*:syn-file-remarks*

						*b:current_syntax-variable*
Vim stores the name of the syntax that has been loaded in the
"b:current_syntax" variable.  You can use this if you want to load other
settings, depending on which syntax is active.	Example: >
   :au BufReadPost * if b:current_syntax == "csh"
   :au BufReadPost *   do-some-things
   :au BufReadPost * endif


2HTML						*2html.vim* *convert-to-HTML*

This is not a syntax file itself, but a script that converts the current
window into HTML. Vim opens a new window in which it builds the HTML file.

After you save the resulting file, you can view it with any browser. The
colors should be exactly the same as you see them in Vim.  With
|g:html_line_ids| you can jump to specific lines by adding (for example) #L123
or #123 to the end of the URL in your browser's address bar. And with
|g:html_dynamic_folds| enabled, you can show or hide the text that is folded
in Vim.

You are not supposed to set the 'filetype' or 'syntax' option to "2html"!
Source the script to convert the current file: >

	:runtime! syntax/2html.vim
<
Many variables affect the output of 2html.vim; see below. Any of the on/off
options listed below can be enabled or disabled by setting them explicitly to
the desired value, or restored to their default by removing the variable using
|:unlet|.

Remarks:
- Some truly ancient browsers may not show the background colors.
- From most browsers you can also print the file (in color)!
- The latest TOhtml may actually work with older versions of Vim, but some
  features such as conceal support will not function, and the colors may be
  incorrect for an old Vim without GUI support compiled in.

Here is an example how to run the script over all .c and .h files from a
Unix shell: >
   for f in *.[ch]; do gvim -f +"syn on" +"run! syntax/2html.vim" +"wq" +"q" $f; done
<
					*g:html_start_line* *g:html_end_line*
To restrict the conversion to a range of lines, use a range with the |:TOhtml|
command below, or set "g:html_start_line" and "g:html_end_line" to the first
and last line to be converted.  Example, using the last set Visual area: >

	:let g:html_start_line = line("'<")
	:let g:html_end_line = line("'>")
	:runtime! syntax/2html.vim
<
							*:TOhtml*
:[range]TOhtml		The ":TOhtml" command is defined in a standard plugin.
			This command will source |2html.vim| for you. When a
			range is given, this command sets |g:html_start_line|
			and |g:html_end_line| to the start and end of the
			range, respectively. Default range is the entire
			buffer.

			If the current window is part of a |diff|, unless
			|g:html_diff_one_file| is set, :TOhtml will convert
			all windows which are part of the diff in the current
			tab and place them side-by-side in a <table> element
			in the generated HTML. With |g:html_line_ids| you can
			jump to lines in specific windows with (for example)
			#W1L42 for line 42 in the first diffed window, or
			#W3L87 for line 87 in the third.

			Examples: >

	:10,40TOhtml " convert lines 10-40 to html
	:'<,'>TOhtml " convert current/last visual selection
	:TOhtml      " convert entire buffer
<
							*g:html_diff_one_file*
Default: 0.
When 0, and using |:TOhtml| all windows involved in a |diff| in the current tab
page are converted to HTML and placed side-by-side in a <table> element. When
1, only the current buffer is converted.
Example: >

	let g:html_diff_one_file = 1
<
							 *g:html_whole_filler*
Default: 0.
When 0, if |g:html_diff_one_file| is 1, a sequence of more than 3 filler lines
is displayed as three lines with the middle line mentioning the total number
of inserted lines.
When 1, always display all inserted lines as if |g:html_diff_one_file| were
not set.
>
    :let g:html_whole_filler = 1
<
				     *TOhtml-performance* *g:html_no_progress*
Default: 0.
When 0, display a progress bar in the statusline for each major step in the
2html.vim conversion process.
When 1, do not display the progress bar. This offers a minor speed improvement
but you won't have any idea how much longer the conversion might take; for big
files it can take a long time!
Example: >

	let g:html_no_progress = 1
<
You can obtain better performance improvements by also instructing Vim to not
run interactively, so that too much time is not taken to redraw as the script
moves through the buffer, switches windows, and the like: >

  vim -E -s -c "let g:html_no_progress=1" -c "syntax on" -c "set ft=c" -c "runtime syntax/2html.vim" -cwqa myfile.c
<
Note that the -s flag prevents loading your vimrc and any plugins, so you
need to explicitly source/enable anything that will affect the HTML
conversion. See |-E| and |-s-ex| for details. It is probably best to create a
script to replace all the -c commands and use it with the -u flag instead of
specifying each command separately.

							 *g:html_number_lines*
Default: current 'number' setting.
When 0, buffer text is displayed in the generated HTML without line numbering.
When 1, a column of line numbers is added to the generated HTML with the same
highlighting as the line number column in Vim (|hl-LineNr|).
Force line numbers even if 'number' is not set: >
   :let g:html_number_lines = 1
Force to omit the line numbers: >
   :let g:html_number_lines = 0
Go back to the default to use 'number' by deleting the variable: >
   :unlet g:html_number_lines
<
                                                             *g:html_line_ids*
Default: 1 if |g:html_number_lines| is set, 0 otherwise.
When 1, adds an HTML id attribute to each line number, or to an empty <span>
inserted for that purpose if no line numbers are shown. This ID attribute
takes the form of L123 for single-buffer HTML pages, or W2L123 for diff-view
pages, and is used to jump to a specific line (in a specific window of a diff
view). Javascript is inserted to open any closed dynamic folds
(|g:html_dynamic_folds|) containing the specified line before jumping. The
javascript also allows omitting the window ID in the url, and the leading L.
For example: >

	page.html#L123	jumps to line 123 in a single-buffer file
	page.html#123	does the same

	diff.html#W1L42	jumps to line 42 in the first window in a diff
	diff.html#42	does the same
<
							      *g:html_use_css*
Default: 1.
When 1, generate valid HTML 4.01 markup with CSS1 styling, supported in all
modern browsers and most old browsers.
When 0, generate <font> tags and similar outdated markup. This is not
recommended but it may work better in really old browsers, email clients,
forum posts, and similar situations where basic CSS support is unavailable.
Example: >
   :let g:html_use_css = 0
<
						       *g:html_ignore_conceal*
Default: 0.
When 0, concealed text is removed from the HTML and replaced with a character
from |:syn-cchar| or 'listchars' as appropriate, depending on the current
value of 'conceallevel'.
When 1, include all text from the buffer in the generated HTML, even if it is
|conceal|ed.

Either of the following commands will ensure that all text in the buffer is
included in the generated HTML (unless it is folded): >
   :let g:html_ignore_conceal = 1
   :setl conceallevel=0
<
						       *g:html_ignore_folding*
Default: 0.
When 0, text in a closed fold is replaced by the text shown for the fold in
Vim (|fold-foldtext|). See |g:html_dynamic_folds| if you also want to allow
the user to expand the fold as in Vim to see the text inside.
When 1, include all text from the buffer in the generated HTML; whether the
text is in a fold has no impact at all. |g:html_dynamic_folds| has no effect.

Either of these commands will ensure that all text in the buffer is included
in the generated HTML (unless it is concealed): >
   zR
   :let g:html_ignore_folding = 1
<
							*g:html_dynamic_folds*
Default: 0.
When 0, text in a closed fold is not included at all in the generated HTML.
When 1, generate javascript to open a fold and show the text within, just like
in Vim.

Setting this variable to 1 causes 2html.vim to always use CSS for styling,
regardless of what |g:html_use_css| is set to.

This variable is ignored when |g:html_ignore_folding| is set.
>
   :let g:html_dynamic_folds = 1
<
							*g:html_no_foldcolumn*
Default: 0.
When 0, if |g:html_dynamic_folds| is 1, generate a column of text similar to
Vim's foldcolumn (|fold-foldcolumn|) the user can click on to toggle folds
open or closed. The minimum width of the generated text column is the current
'foldcolumn' setting.
When 1, do not generate this column; instead, hovering the mouse cursor over
folded text will open the fold as if |g:html_hover_unfold| were set.
>
   :let g:html_no_foldcolumn = 1
<
				*TOhtml-uncopyable-text* *g:html_prevent_copy*
Default: empty string.
This option prevents certain regions of the generated HTML from being copied,
when you select all text in document rendered in a browser and copy it. Useful
for allowing users to copy-paste only the source text even if a fold column or
line numbers are shown in the generated content. Specify regions to be
affected in this way as follows:
	f:	fold column
	n:	line numbers (also within fold text)
	t:	fold text
	d:	diff filler

Example, to make the fold column and line numbers uncopyable: >
	:let g:html_prevent_copy = "fn"
<
This feature is currently implemented by inserting read-only <input> elements
into the markup to contain the uncopyable areas. This does not work well in
all cases. When pasting to some applications which understand HTML, the
<input> elements also get pasted. But plain-text paste destinations should
always work.

							   *g:html_no_invalid*
Default: 0.
When 0, if |g:html_prevent_copy| is non-empty, an invalid attribute is
intentionally inserted into the <input> element for the uncopyable areas. This
increases the number of applications you can paste to without also pasting the
<input> elements. Specifically, Microsoft Word will not paste the <input>
elements if they contain this invalid attribute.
When 1, no invalid markup is ever intentionally inserted, and the generated
page should validate. However, be careful pasting into Microsoft Word when
|g:html_prevent_copy| is non-empty; it can be hard to get rid of the <input>
elements which get pasted.

							 *g:html_hover_unfold*
Default: 0.
When 0, the only way to open a fold generated by 2html.vim with
|g:html_dynamic_folds| set, is to click on the generated fold column.
When 1, use CSS 2.0 to allow the user to open a fold by moving the mouse
cursor over the displayed fold text. This is useful to allow users with
disabled javascript to view the folded text.

Note that old browsers (notably Internet Explorer 6) will not support this
feature.  Browser-specific markup for IE6 is included to fall back to the
normal CSS1 styling so that the folds show up correctly for this browser, but
they will not be openable without a foldcolumn.
>
   :let g:html_hover_unfold = 1
<
							      *g:html_id_expr*
Default: ""
Dynamic folding and jumping to line IDs rely on unique IDs within the document
to work. If generated HTML is copied into a larger document, these IDs are no
longer guaranteed to be unique. Set g:html_id_expr to an expression Vim can
evaluate to get a unique string to append to each ID used in a given document,
so that the full IDs will be unique even when combined with other content in a
larger HTML document. Example, to append _ and the buffer number to each ID: >

	:let g:html_id_expr = '"_".bufnr("%")'
<
To append a string "_mystring" to the end of each ID: >

	:let g:html_id_expr = '"_mystring"'
<
Note, when converting a diff view to HTML, the expression will only be
evaluated for the first window in the diff, and the result used for all the
windows.

					  *TOhtml-wrap-text* *g:html_pre_wrap*
Default: current 'wrap' setting.
When 0, if |g:html_no_pre| is 0 or unset, the text in the generated HTML does
not wrap at the edge of the browser window.
When 1, if |g:html_use_css| is 1, the CSS 2.0 "white-space:pre-wrap" value is
used, causing the text to wrap at whitespace at the edge of the browser
window.
Explicitly enable text wrapping: >
   :let g:html_pre_wrap = 1
Explicitly disable wrapping: >
   :let g:html_pre_wrap = 0
Go back to default, determine wrapping from 'wrap' setting: >
   :unlet g:html_pre_wrap
<
							       *g:html_no_pre*
Default: 0.
When 0, buffer text in the generated HTML is surrounded by <pre>...</pre>
tags. Series of whitespace is shown as in Vim without special markup, and tab
characters can be included literally (see |g:html_expand_tabs|).
When 1 (not recommended), the <pre> tags are omitted, and a plain <div> is
used instead. Whitespace is replaced by a series of &nbsp; character
references, and <br> is used to end each line. This is another way to allow
text in the generated HTML is wrap (see |g:html_pre_wrap|) which also works in
old browsers, but may cause noticeable differences between Vim's display and
the rendered page generated by 2html.vim.
>
   :let g:html_no_pre = 1
<
							  *g:html_expand_tabs*
Default: 1 if 'tabstop' is 8, 'expandtab' is 0, and no fold column or line
		numbers occur in the generated HTML;
	 0 otherwise.
When 0, <Tab> characters in the buffer text are replaced with an appropriate
number of space characters, or &nbsp; references if |g:html_no_pre| is 1.
When 1, if |g:html_no_pre| is 0 or unset, <Tab> characters in the buffer text
are included as-is in the generated HTML. This is useful for when you want to
allow copy and paste from a browser without losing the actual whitespace in
the source document. Note that this can easily break text alignment and
indentation in the HTML, unless set by default.

Force |2html.vim| to keep <Tab> characters: >
   :let g:html_expand_tabs = 0
<
Force tabs to be expanded: >
   :let g:html_expand_tabs = 1
<
				    *TOhtml-encoding-detect* *TOhtml-encoding*
It is highly recommended to set your desired encoding with
|g:html_use_encoding| for any content which will be placed on a web server.

If you do not specify an encoding, |2html.vim| uses the preferred IANA name
for the current value of 'fileencoding' if set, or 'encoding' if not.
'encoding' is always used for certain 'buftype' values. 'fileencoding' will be
set to match the chosen document encoding.

Automatic detection works for the encodings mentioned specifically by name in
|encoding-names|, but TOhtml will only automatically use those encodings with
wide browser support. However, you can override this to support specific
encodings that may not be automatically detected by default (see options
below). See http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets for the IANA names.

Note, by default all Unicode encodings are converted to UTF-8 with no BOM in
the generated HTML, as recommended by W3C:

	http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-encodings
	http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-byte-order-mark

							 *g:html_use_encoding*
Default: none, uses IANA name for current 'fileencoding' as above.
To overrule all automatic charset detection, set g:html_use_encoding to the
name of the charset to be used. It is recommended to set this variable to
something widely supported, like UTF-8, for anything you will be hosting on a
webserver: >
   :let g:html_use_encoding = "UTF-8"
You can also use this option to omit the line that specifies the charset
entirely, by setting g:html_use_encoding to an empty string (NOT recommended): >
   :let g:html_use_encoding = ""
To go back to the automatic mechanism, delete the |g:html_use_encoding|
variable: >
   :unlet g:html_use_encoding
<
						    *g:html_encoding_override*
Default: none, autoload/tohtml.vim contains default conversions for encodings
		mentioned by name at |encoding-names|.
This option allows |2html.vim| to detect the correct 'fileencoding' when you
specify an encoding with |g:html_use_encoding| which is not in the default
list of conversions.

This is a dictionary of charset-encoding pairs that will replace existing
pairs automatically detected by TOhtml, or supplement with new pairs.

Detect the HTML charset "windows-1252" as the encoding "8bit-cp1252": >
   :let g:html_encoding_override = {'windows-1252': '8bit-cp1252'}
<
						     *g:html_charset_override*
Default: none, autoload/tohtml.vim contains default conversions for encodings
		mentioned by name at |encoding-names| and which have wide
		browser support.
This option allows |2html.vim| to detect the HTML charset for any
'fileencoding' or 'encoding' which is not detected automatically. You can also
use it to override specific existing encoding-charset pairs. For example,
TOhtml will by default use UTF-8 for all Unicode/UCS encodings. To use UTF-16
and UTF-32 instead, use: >
   :let g:html_charset_override = {'ucs-4': 'UTF-32', 'utf-16': 'UTF-16'}

Note that documents encoded in either UTF-32 or UTF-16 have known
compatibility problems with some major browsers.

								 *g:html_font*
Default: "monospace"
You can specify the font or fonts used in the converted document using
g:html_font. If this option is set to a string, then the value will be
surrounded with single quotes. If this option is set to a list then each list
item is surrounded by single quotes and the list is joined with commas. Either
way, "monospace" is added as the fallback generic family name and the entire
result used as the font family (using CSS) or font face (if not using CSS).
Examples: >

   " font-family: 'Consolas', monospace;
   :let g:html_font = "Consolas"

   " font-family: 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'Consolas', monospace;
   :let g:html_font = ["DejaVu Sans Mono", "Consolas"]
<
			*convert-to-XML* *convert-to-XHTML* *g:html_use_xhtml*
Default: 0.
When 0, generate standard HTML 4.01 (strict when possible).
When 1, generate XHTML 1.0 instead (XML compliant HTML).
>
    :let g:html_use_xhtml = 1
<

ABEL						*abel.vim* *ft-abel-syntax*

ABEL highlighting provides some user-defined options.  To enable them, assign
any value to the respective variable.  Example: >
	:let abel_obsolete_ok=1
To disable them use ":unlet".  Example: >
	:unlet abel_obsolete_ok

Variable			Highlight ~
abel_obsolete_ok		obsolete keywords are statements, not errors
abel_cpp_comments_illegal	do not interpret '//' as inline comment leader


ADA

See |ft-ada-syntax|


ANT						*ant.vim* *ft-ant-syntax*

The ant syntax file provides syntax highlighting for javascript and python
by default.  Syntax highlighting for other script languages can be installed
by the function AntSyntaxScript(), which takes the tag name as first argument
and the script syntax file name as second argument.  Example: >

	:call AntSyntaxScript('perl', 'perl.vim')

will install syntax perl highlighting for the following ant code >

	<script language = 'perl'><![CDATA[
	    # everything inside is highlighted as perl
	]]></script>

See |mysyntaxfile-add| for installing script languages permanently.


APACHE						*apache.vim* *ft-apache-syntax*

The apache syntax file provides syntax highlighting depending on Apache HTTP
server version, by default for 1.3.x.  Set "apache_version" to Apache version
(as a string) to get highlighting for another version.	Example: >

	:let apache_version = "2.0"
<

		*asm.vim* *asmh8300.vim* *nasm.vim* *masm.vim* *asm68k*
ASSEMBLY	*ft-asm-syntax* *ft-asmh8300-syntax* *ft-nasm-syntax*
		*ft-masm-syntax* *ft-asm68k-syntax* *fasm.vim*

Files matching "*.i" could be Progress or Assembly.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit Progress at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >
   :let filetype_i = "asm"
Replace "asm" with the type of assembly you use.

There are many types of assembly languages that all use the same file name
extensions.  Therefore you will have to select the type yourself, or add a
line in the assembly file that Vim will recognize.  Currently these syntax
files are included:
	asm		GNU assembly (the default)
	asm68k		Motorola 680x0 assembly
	asmh8300	Hitachi H-8300 version of GNU assembly
	ia64		Intel Itanium 64
	fasm		Flat assembly (http://flatassembler.net)
	masm		Microsoft assembly (probably works for any 80x86)
	nasm		Netwide assembly
	tasm		Turbo Assembly (with opcodes 80x86 up to Pentium, and
			MMX)
	pic		PIC assembly (currently for PIC16F84)

The most flexible is to add a line in your assembly file containing: >
	asmsyntax=nasm
Replace "nasm" with the name of the real assembly syntax.  This line must be
one of the first five lines in the file.  No non-white text must be
immediately before or after this text.  Note that specifying asmsyntax=foo is
equivalent to setting ft=foo in a |modeline|, and that in case of a conflict
between the two settings the one from the modeline will take precedence (in
particular, if you have ft=asm in the modeline, you will get the GNU syntax
highlighting regardless of what is specified as asmsyntax).

The syntax type can always be overruled for a specific buffer by setting the
b:asmsyntax variable: >
	:let b:asmsyntax = "nasm"

If b:asmsyntax is not set, either automatically or by hand, then the value of
the global variable asmsyntax is used.	This can be seen as a default assembly
language: >
	:let asmsyntax = "nasm"

As a last resort, if nothing is defined, the "asm" syntax is used.


Netwide assembler (nasm.vim) optional highlighting ~

To enable a feature: >
	:let   {variable}=1|set syntax=nasm
To disable a feature: >
	:unlet {variable}  |set syntax=nasm

Variable		Highlight ~
nasm_loose_syntax	unofficial parser allowed syntax not as Error
			  (parser dependent; not recommended)
nasm_ctx_outside_macro	contexts outside macro not as Error
nasm_no_warn		potentially risky syntax not as ToDo


ASPPERL and ASPVBS			*ft-aspperl-syntax* *ft-aspvbs-syntax*

*.asp and *.asa files could be either Perl or Visual Basic script.  Since it's
hard to detect this you can set two global variables to tell Vim what you are
using.	For Perl script use: >
	:let g:filetype_asa = "aspperl"
	:let g:filetype_asp = "aspperl"
For Visual Basic use: >
	:let g:filetype_asa = "aspvbs"
	:let g:filetype_asp = "aspvbs"


BAAN						    *baan.vim* *baan-syntax*

The baan.vim gives syntax support for BaanC of release BaanIV upto SSA ERP LN
for both 3 GL and 4 GL programming. Large number of standard defines/constants
are supported.

Some special violation of coding standards will be signalled when one specify
in ones |init.vim|: >
	let baan_code_stds=1

*baan-folding*

Syntax folding can be enabled at various levels through the variables
mentioned below (Set those in your |init.vim|). The more complex folding on
source blocks and SQL can be CPU intensive.

To allow any folding and enable folding at function level use: >
	let baan_fold=1
Folding can be enabled at source block level as if, while, for ,... The
indentation preceding the begin/end keywords has to match (spaces are not
considered equal to a tab). >
	let baan_fold_block=1
Folding can be enabled for embedded SQL blocks as SELECT, SELECTDO,
SELECTEMPTY, ... The indentation preceding the begin/end keywords has to
match (spaces are not considered equal to a tab). >
	let baan_fold_sql=1
Note: Block folding can result in many small folds. It is suggested to |:set|
the options 'foldminlines' and 'foldnestmax' in |init.vim| or use |:setlocal| 
in .../after/syntax/baan.vim (see |after-directory|). Eg: >
	set foldminlines=5
	set foldnestmax=6


BASIC			*basic.vim* *vb.vim* *ft-basic-syntax* *ft-vb-syntax*

Both Visual Basic and "normal" basic use the extension ".bas".	To detect
which one should be used, Vim checks for the string "VB_Name" in the first
five lines of the file.  If it is not found, filetype will be "basic",
otherwise "vb".  Files with the ".frm" extension will always be seen as Visual
Basic.


C							*c.vim* *ft-c-syntax*

A few things in C highlighting are optional.  To enable them assign any value
to the respective variable.  Example: >
	:let c_comment_strings = 1
To disable them use ":unlet".  Example: >
	:unlet c_comment_strings

Variable		Highlight ~
*c_gnu*			GNU gcc specific items
*c_comment_strings*	strings and numbers inside a comment
*c_space_errors*		trailing white space and spaces before a <Tab>
*c_no_trail_space_error*	 ... but no trailing spaces
*c_no_tab_space_error*	 ... but no spaces before a <Tab>
*c_no_bracket_error*	don't highlight {}; inside [] as errors
*c_no_curly_error*	don't highlight {}; inside [] and () as errors;
				except { and } in first column
*c_curly_error*		highlight a missing }; this forces syncing from the
			start of the file, can be slow
*c_no_ansi*		don't do standard ANSI types and constants
*c_ansi_typedefs*		 ... but do standard ANSI types
*c_ansi_constants*	 ... but do standard ANSI constants
*c_no_utf*		don't highlight \u and \U in strings
*c_syntax_for_h*		for *.h files use C syntax instead of C++ and use objc
			syntax instead of objcpp
*c_no_if0*		don't highlight "#if 0" blocks as comments
*c_no_cformat*		don't highlight %-formats in strings
*c_no_c99*		don't highlight C99 standard items
*c_no_c11*		don't highlight C11 standard items
*c_no_bsd*		don't highlight BSD specific types

When 'foldmethod' is set to "syntax" then /* */ comments and { } blocks will
become a fold.  If you don't want comments to become a fold use: >
	:let c_no_comment_fold = 1
"#if 0" blocks are also folded, unless: >
	:let c_no_if0_fold = 1

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "c_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >
	:let c_minlines = 100
This will make the syntax synchronization start 100 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 50 (15 when c_no_if0 is set).  The
disadvantage of using a larger number is that redrawing can become slow.

When using the "#if 0" / "#endif" comment highlighting, notice that this only
works when the "#if 0" is within "c_minlines" from the top of the window.  If
you have a long "#if 0" construct it will not be highlighted correctly.

To match extra items in comments, use the cCommentGroup cluster.
Example: >
   :au Syntax c call MyCadd()
   :function MyCadd()
   :  syn keyword cMyItem contained Ni
   :  syn cluster cCommentGroup add=cMyItem
   :  hi link cMyItem Title
   :endfun

ANSI constants will be highlighted with the "cConstant" group.	This includes
"NULL", "SIG_IGN" and others.  But not "TRUE", for example, because this is
not in the ANSI standard.  If you find this confusing, remove the cConstant
highlighting: >
	:hi link cConstant NONE

If you see '{' and '}' highlighted as an error where they are OK, reset the
highlighting for cErrInParen and cErrInBracket.

If you want to use folding in your C files, you can add these lines in a file
in the "after" directory in 'runtimepath'.  For Unix this would be
~/.config/nvim/after/syntax/c.vim. >
    syn sync fromstart
    set foldmethod=syntax

CH						*ch.vim* *ft-ch-syntax*

C/C++ interpreter.  Ch has similar syntax highlighting to C and builds upon
the C syntax file.  See |c.vim| for all the settings that are available for C.

By setting a variable you can tell Vim to use Ch syntax for *.h files, instead
of C or C++: >
	:let ch_syntax_for_h = 1


CHILL						*chill.vim* *ft-chill-syntax*

Chill syntax highlighting is similar to C.  See |c.vim| for all the settings
that are available.  Additionally there is:

chill_space_errors	like c_space_errors
chill_comment_string	like c_comment_strings
chill_minlines		like c_minlines


CHANGELOG				*changelog.vim* *ft-changelog-syntax*

ChangeLog supports highlighting spaces at the start of a line.
If you do not like this, add following line to your vimrc: >
	let g:changelog_spacing_errors = 0
This works the next time you edit a changelog file.  You can also use
"b:changelog_spacing_errors" to set this per buffer (before loading the syntax
file).

You can change the highlighting used, e.g., to flag the spaces as an error: >
	:hi link ChangelogError Error
Or to avoid the highlighting: >
	:hi link ChangelogError NONE
This works immediately.


CLOJURE							*ft-clojure-syntax*

Setting *g:clojure_fold* enables folding Clojure code via the syntax engine.
Any list, vector, or map that extends over more than one line can be folded
using the standard Vim |fold-commands|.

Please note that this option does not work with scripts that redefine the
bracket syntax regions, such as rainbow-parentheses plugins.

This option is off by default.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_fold = 0
<

COBOL						*cobol.vim* *ft-cobol-syntax*

COBOL highlighting has different needs for legacy code than it does for fresh
development.  This is due to differences in what is being done (maintenance
versus development) and other factors.	To enable legacy code highlighting,
add this line to your vimrc: >
	:let cobol_legacy_code = 1
To disable it again, use this: >
	:unlet cobol_legacy_code


COLD FUSION			*coldfusion.vim* *ft-coldfusion-syntax*

The ColdFusion has its own version of HTML comments.  To turn on ColdFusion
comment highlighting, add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let html_wrong_comments = 1

The ColdFusion syntax file is based on the HTML syntax file.


CPP						*cpp.vim* *ft-cpp-syntax*

Most of things are same as |ft-c-syntax|.

Variable		Highlight ~
cpp_no_cpp11		don't highlight C++11 standard items
cpp_no_cpp14		don't highlight C++14 standard items


CSH						*csh.vim* *ft-csh-syntax*

This covers the shell named "csh".  Note that on some systems tcsh is actually
used.

Detecting whether a file is csh or tcsh is notoriously hard.  Some systems
symlink /bin/csh to /bin/tcsh, making it almost impossible to distinguish
between csh and tcsh.  In case VIM guesses wrong you can set the
"filetype_csh" variable.  For using csh:  *g:filetype_csh*
>
	:let g:filetype_csh = "csh"

For using tcsh: >

	:let g:filetype_csh = "tcsh"

Any script with a tcsh extension or a standard tcsh filename (.tcshrc,
tcsh.tcshrc, tcsh.login) will have filetype tcsh.  All other tcsh/csh scripts
will be classified as tcsh, UNLESS the "filetype_csh" variable exists.  If the
"filetype_csh" variable exists, the filetype will be set to the value of the
variable.


CYNLIB						*cynlib.vim* *ft-cynlib-syntax*

Cynlib files are C++ files that use the Cynlib class library to enable
hardware modelling and simulation using C++.  Typically Cynlib files have a .cc
or a .cpp extension, which makes it very difficult to distinguish them from a
normal C++ file.  Thus, to enable Cynlib highlighting for .cc files, add this
line to your vimrc file: >

	:let cynlib_cyntax_for_cc=1

Similarly for cpp files (this extension is only usually used in Windows) >

	:let cynlib_cyntax_for_cpp=1

To disable these again, use this: >

	:unlet cynlib_cyntax_for_cc
	:unlet cynlib_cyntax_for_cpp
<

CWEB						*cweb.vim* *ft-cweb-syntax*

Files matching "*.w" could be Progress or cweb.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit Progress at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >
   :let filetype_w = "cweb"


DESKTOP					   *desktop.vim* *ft-desktop-syntax*

Primary goal of this syntax file is to highlight .desktop and .directory files
according to freedesktop.org standard:
http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/
But actually almost none implements this standard fully.  Thus it will
highlight all Unix ini files.  But you can force strict highlighting according
to standard by placing this in your vimrc file: >
	:let enforce_freedesktop_standard = 1


DIFF							*diff.vim*

The diff highlighting normally finds translated headers.  This can be slow if
there are very long lines in the file.  To disable translations: >

	:let diff_translations = 0

Also see |diff-slow|.


DIRCOLORS			       *dircolors.vim* *ft-dircolors-syntax*

The dircolors utility highlighting definition has one option.  It exists to
provide compatibility with the Slackware GNU/Linux distributions version of
the command.  It adds a few keywords that are generally ignored by most
versions.  On Slackware systems, however, the utility accepts the keywords and
uses them for processing.  To enable the Slackware keywords add the following
line to your startup file: >
	let dircolors_is_slackware = 1


DOCBOOK					*docbk.vim* *ft-docbk-syntax* *docbook*
DOCBOOK XML				*docbkxml.vim* *ft-docbkxml-syntax*
DOCBOOK SGML				*docbksgml.vim* *ft-docbksgml-syntax*

There are two types of DocBook files: SGML and XML.  To specify what type you
are using the "b:docbk_type" variable should be set.  Vim does this for you
automatically if it can recognize the type.  When Vim can't guess it the type
defaults to XML.
You can set the type manually: >
	:let docbk_type = "sgml"
or: >
	:let docbk_type = "xml"
You need to do this before loading the syntax file, which is complicated.
Simpler is setting the filetype to "docbkxml" or "docbksgml": >
	:set filetype=docbksgml
or: >
	:set filetype=docbkxml

You can specify the DocBook version: >
	:let docbk_ver = 3
When not set 4 is used.


DOSBATCH				*dosbatch.vim* *ft-dosbatch-syntax*

There is one option with highlighting DOS batch files.	This covers new
extensions to the Command Interpreter introduced with Windows 2000 and
is controlled by the variable dosbatch_cmdextversion.  For Windows NT
this should have the value 1, and for Windows 2000 it should be 2.
Select the version you want with the following line: >

   :let dosbatch_cmdextversion = 1

If this variable is not defined it defaults to a value of 2 to support
Windows 2000.

A second option covers whether *.btm files should be detected as type
"dosbatch" (MS-DOS batch files) or type "btm" (4DOS batch files).  The latter
is used by default.  You may select the former with the following line: >

   :let g:dosbatch_syntax_for_btm = 1

If this variable is undefined or zero, btm syntax is selected.


DOXYGEN						*doxygen.vim* *doxygen-syntax*

Doxygen generates code documentation using a special documentation format
(similar to Javadoc).  This syntax script adds doxygen highlighting to c, cpp,
idl and php files, and should also work with java.

There are a few of ways to turn on doxygen formatting. It can be done
explicitly or in a modeline by appending '.doxygen' to the syntax of the file.
Example: >
	:set syntax=c.doxygen
or >
	// vim:syntax=c.doxygen

It can also be done automatically for C, C++, C#, IDL and PHP files by setting
the global or buffer-local variable load_doxygen_syntax.  This is done by
adding the following to your vimrc. >
	:let g:load_doxygen_syntax=1

There are a couple of variables that have an effect on syntax highlighting, and
are to do with non-standard highlighting options.

Variable			Default	Effect ~
g:doxygen_enhanced_color
g:doxygen_enhanced_colour	0	Use non-standard highlighting for
					doxygen comments.

doxygen_my_rendering		0	Disable rendering of HTML bold, italic
					and html_my_rendering underline.

doxygen_javadoc_autobrief	1	Set to 0 to disable javadoc autobrief
					colour highlighting.

doxygen_end_punctuation		'[.]'	Set to regexp match for the ending
					punctuation of brief

There are also some hilight groups worth mentioning as they can be useful in
configuration.

Highlight			Effect ~
doxygenErrorComment		The colour of an end-comment when missing
				punctuation in a code, verbatim or dot section
doxygenLinkError		The colour of an end-comment when missing the
				\endlink from a \link section.


DTD						*dtd.vim* *ft-dtd-syntax*

The DTD syntax highlighting is case sensitive by default.  To disable
case-sensitive highlighting, add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let dtd_ignore_case=1

The DTD syntax file will highlight unknown tags as errors.  If
this is annoying, it can be turned off by setting: >

	:let dtd_no_tag_errors=1

before sourcing the dtd.vim syntax file.
Parameter entity names are highlighted in the definition using the
'Type' highlighting group and 'Comment' for punctuation and '%'.
Parameter entity instances are highlighted using the 'Constant'
highlighting group and the 'Type' highlighting group for the
delimiters % and ;.  This can be turned off by setting: >

	:let dtd_no_param_entities=1

The DTD syntax file is also included by xml.vim to highlight included dtd's.


EIFFEL					*eiffel.vim* *ft-eiffel-syntax*

While Eiffel is not case-sensitive, its style guidelines are, and the
syntax highlighting file encourages their use.  This also allows to
highlight class names differently.  If you want to disable case-sensitive
highlighting, add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let eiffel_ignore_case=1

Case still matters for class names and TODO marks in comments.

Conversely, for even stricter checks, add one of the following lines: >

	:let eiffel_strict=1
	:let eiffel_pedantic=1

Setting eiffel_strict will only catch improper capitalization for the
five predefined words "Current", "Void", "Result", "Precursor", and
"NONE", to warn against their accidental use as feature or class names.

Setting eiffel_pedantic will enforce adherence to the Eiffel style
guidelines fairly rigorously (like arbitrary mixes of upper- and
lowercase letters as well as outdated ways to capitalize keywords).

If you want to use the lower-case version of "Current", "Void",
"Result", and "Precursor", you can use >

	:let eiffel_lower_case_predef=1

instead of completely turning case-sensitive highlighting off.

Support for ISE's proposed new creation syntax that is already
experimentally handled by some compilers can be enabled by: >

	:let eiffel_ise=1

Finally, some vendors support hexadecimal constants.  To handle them, add >

	:let eiffel_hex_constants=1

to your startup file.


EUPHORIA	    *euphoria3.vim* *euphoria4.vim* *ft-euphoria-syntax*

Two syntax highlighting files exists for Euphoria. One for Euphoria 
version 3.1.1, which is the default syntax highlighting file, and one for 
Euphoria version 4.0.5 or later.

Euphoria version 3.1.1 (http://www.rapideuphoria.com/) is still necessary 
for developing applications for the DOS platform, which Euphoria version 4 
(http://www.openeuphoria.org/) does not support.

The following file extensions are auto-detected as Euphoria file type: 
    
	*.e, *.eu, *.ew, *.ex, *.exu, *.exw
	*.E, *.EU, *.EW, *.EX, *.EXU, *.EXW

To select syntax highlighting file for Euphoria, as well as for 
auto-detecting the *.e and *.E file extensions as Euphoria file type,
add the following line to your startup file: >

	:let filetype_euphoria="euphoria3"

	or 

	:let filetype_euphoria="euphoria4"


ERLANG						*erlang.vim* *ft-erlang-syntax*

Erlang is a functional programming language developed by Ericsson.  Files with
the following extensions are recognized as Erlang files: erl, hrl, yaws.

The BIFs (built-in functions) are highlighted by default. To disable this,
put the following line in your vimrc: >

      :let g:erlang_highlight_bifs = 0

To enable highlighting some special atoms, put this in your vimrc: >

      :let g:erlang_highlight_special_atoms = 1


FLEXWIKI				*flexwiki.vim* *ft-flexwiki-syntax*

FlexWiki is an ASP.NET-based wiki package available at http://www.flexwiki.com
NOTE: this site currently doesn't work, on Wikipedia is mentioned that
development stopped in 2009.

Syntax highlighting is available for the most common elements of FlexWiki
syntax. The associated ftplugin script sets some buffer-local options to make
editing FlexWiki pages more convenient. FlexWiki considers a newline as the
start of a new paragraph, so the ftplugin sets 'tw'=0 (unlimited line length),
'wrap' (wrap long lines instead of using horizontal scrolling), 'linebreak'
(to wrap at a character in 'breakat' instead of at the last char on screen),
and so on. It also includes some keymaps that are disabled by default.

If you want to enable the keymaps that make "j" and "k" and the cursor keys
move up and down by display lines, add this to your vimrc: >
	:let flexwiki_maps = 1


FORM						*form.vim* *ft-form-syntax*

The coloring scheme for syntax elements in the FORM file uses the default
modes Conditional, Number, Statement, Comment, PreProc, Type, and String,
following the language specifications in 'Symbolic Manipulation with FORM' by
J.A.M. Vermaseren, CAN, Netherlands, 1991.

If you want include your own changes to the default colors, you have to
redefine the following syntax groups:

    - formConditional
    - formNumber
    - formStatement
    - formHeaderStatement
    - formComment
    - formPreProc
    - formDirective
    - formType
    - formString

Note that the form.vim syntax file implements FORM preprocessor commands and
directives per default in the same syntax group.

A predefined enhanced color mode for FORM is available to distinguish between
header statements and statements in the body of a FORM program.  To activate
this mode define the following variable in your vimrc file >

	:let form_enhanced_color=1

The enhanced mode also takes advantage of additional color features for a dark
gvim display.  Here, statements are colored LightYellow instead of Yellow, and
conditionals are LightBlue for better distinction.


FORTRAN					*fortran.vim* *ft-fortran-syntax*

Default highlighting and dialect ~
Highlighting appropriate for Fortran 2008 is used by default.  This choice
should be appropriate for most users most of the time because Fortran 2008 is
almost a superset of previous versions (Fortran 2003, 95, 90, and 77).

Fortran source code form ~
Fortran code can be in either fixed or free source form.  Note that the
syntax highlighting will not be correct if the form is incorrectly set.

When you create a new fortran file, the syntax script assumes fixed source
form.  If you always use free source form, then >
    :let fortran_free_source=1
in your vimrc prior to the :syntax on command.  If you always use fixed source
form, then >
    :let fortran_fixed_source=1
in your vimrc prior to the :syntax on command.

If the form of the source code depends, in a non-standard way, upon the file
extension, then it is most convenient to set fortran_free_source in a ftplugin
file.  For more information on ftplugin files, see |ftplugin|. Note that this
will work only if the "filetype plugin indent on" command precedes the "syntax
on" command in your .vimrc file.


When you edit an existing fortran file, the syntax script will assume free
source form if the fortran_free_source variable has been set, and assumes
fixed source form if the fortran_fixed_source variable has been set.  If
neither of these variables have been set, the syntax script attempts to
determine which source form has been used by examining the file extension
using conventions common to the ifort, gfortran, Cray, NAG, and PathScale
compilers (.f, .for, .f77 for fixed-source, .f90, .f95, .f03, .f08 for
free-source). If none of this works, then the script examines the first five
columns of the first 500 lines of your file.  If no signs of free source form
are detected, then the file is assumed to be in fixed source form.  The
algorithm should work in the vast majority of cases.  In some cases, such as a
file that begins with 500 or more full-line comments, the script may
incorrectly decide that the fortran code is in fixed form.  If that happens,
just add a non-comment statement beginning anywhere in the first five columns
of the first twenty five lines, save (:w) and then reload (:e!) the file.

Tabs in fortran files ~
Tabs are not recognized by the Fortran standards.  Tabs are not a good idea in
fixed format fortran source code which requires fixed column boundaries.
Therefore, tabs are marked as errors.  Nevertheless, some programmers like
using tabs.  If your fortran files contain tabs, then you should set the
variable fortran_have_tabs in your vimrc with a command such as >
    :let fortran_have_tabs=1
placed prior to the :syntax on command.  Unfortunately, the use of tabs will
mean that the syntax file will not be able to detect incorrect margins.

Syntax folding of fortran files ~
If you wish to use foldmethod=syntax, then you must first set the variable
fortran_fold with a command such as >
    :let fortran_fold=1
to instruct the syntax script to define fold regions for program units, that
is main programs starting with a program statement, subroutines, function
subprograms, block data subprograms, interface blocks, and modules.  If you
also set the variable fortran_fold_conditionals with a command such as >
    :let fortran_fold_conditionals=1
then fold regions will also be defined for do loops, if blocks, and select
case constructs.  If you also set the variable
fortran_fold_multilinecomments with a command such as >
    :let fortran_fold_multilinecomments=1
then fold regions will also be defined for three or more consecutive comment
lines.  Note that defining fold regions can be slow for large files.

If fortran_fold, and possibly fortran_fold_conditionals and/or
fortran_fold_multilinecomments, have been set, then vim will fold your file if
you set foldmethod=syntax.  Comments or blank lines placed between two program
units are not folded because they are seen as not belonging to any program
unit.

More precise fortran syntax ~
If you set the variable fortran_more_precise with a command such as >
    :let fortran_more_precise=1
then the syntax coloring will be more precise but slower.  In particular,
statement labels used in do, goto and arithmetic if statements will be
recognized, as will construct names at the end of a do, if, select or forall
construct.

Non-default fortran dialects ~
The syntax script supports two Fortran dialects: f08 and F. You will probably
find the default highlighting (f08) satisfactory.  A few legacy constructs
deleted or declared obsolescent in the 2008 standard are highlighted as todo
items.

If you use F, the advantage of setting the dialect appropriately is that
other legacy features excluded from F will be highlighted as todo items and
that free source form will be assumed.

The dialect can be selected in various ways.  If all your fortran files use
the same dialect, set the global variable fortran_dialect in your vimrc prior
to your syntax on statement.  The case-sensitive, permissible values of
fortran_dialect are "f08" or "F".  Invalid values of fortran_dialect are
ignored.

If the dialect depends upon the file extension, then it is most convenient to
set a buffer-local variable in a ftplugin file.  For more information on
ftplugin files, see |ftplugin|.  For example, if all your fortran files with
an .f90 extension are written in the F subset, your ftplugin file should
contain the code >
    let s:extfname = expand("%:e")
    if s:extfname ==? "f90"
	let b:fortran_dialect="F"
    else
	unlet! b:fortran_dialect
    endif
Note that this will work only if the "filetype plugin indent on" command
precedes the "syntax on" command in your vimrc file.

Finer control is necessary if the file extension does not uniquely identify
the dialect.  You can override the default dialect, on a file-by-file basis,
by including a comment with the directive "fortran_dialect=xx" (where xx=F or
f08) in one of the first three lines in your file.  For example, your older .f
files may be legacy code but your newer ones may be F codes, and you would
identify the latter by including in the first three lines of those files a
Fortran comment of the form >
  ! fortran_dialect=F

For previous versions of the syntax, you may have set fortran_dialect to the
now-obsolete values "f77", "f90", "f95", or "elf". Such settings will be
silently handled as "f08". Users of "elf" may wish to experiment with "F"
instead.

The syntax/fortran.vim script contains embedded comments that tell you how to
comment and/or uncomment some lines to (a) activate recognition of some
non-standard, vendor-supplied intrinsics and (b) to prevent features deleted
or declared obsolescent in the 2008 standard from being highlighted as todo
items.

Limitations ~
Parenthesis checking does not catch too few closing parentheses.  Hollerith
strings are not recognized.  Some keywords may be highlighted incorrectly
because Fortran90 has no reserved words.

For further information related to fortran, see |ft-fortran-indent| and
|ft-fortran-plugin|.


FVWM CONFIGURATION FILES			*fvwm.vim* *ft-fvwm-syntax*

In order for Vim to recognize Fvwm configuration files that do not match
the patterns *fvwmrc* or *fvwm2rc* , you must put additional patterns
appropriate to your system in your myfiletypes.vim file.  For these
patterns, you must set the variable "b:fvwm_version" to the major version
number of Fvwm, and the 'filetype' option to fvwm.

For example, to make Vim identify all files in /etc/X11/fvwm2/
as Fvwm2 configuration files, add the following: >

  :au! BufNewFile,BufRead /etc/X11/fvwm2/*  let b:fvwm_version = 2 |
					 \ set filetype=fvwm

If you'd like Vim to highlight all valid color names, tell it where to
find the color database (rgb.txt) on your system.  Do this by setting
"rgb_file" to its location.  Assuming your color database is located
in /usr/X11/lib/X11/, you should add the line >

	:let rgb_file = "/usr/X11/lib/X11/rgb.txt"

to your vimrc file.


GSP						*gsp.vim* *ft-gsp-syntax*

The default coloring style for GSP pages is defined by |html.vim|, and
the coloring for java code (within java tags or inline between backticks)
is defined by |java.vim|.  The following HTML groups defined in |html.vim|
are redefined to incorporate and highlight inline java code:

    htmlString
    htmlValue
    htmlEndTag
    htmlTag
    htmlTagN

Highlighting should look fine most of the places where you'd see inline
java code, but in some special cases it may not.  To add another HTML
group where you will have inline java code where it does not highlight
correctly, just copy the line you want from |html.vim| and add gspJava
to the contains clause.

The backticks for inline java are highlighted according to the htmlError
group to make them easier to see.


GROFF						*groff.vim* *ft-groff-syntax*

The groff syntax file is a wrapper for |nroff.vim|, see the notes
under that heading for examples of use and configuration.  The purpose
of this wrapper is to set up groff syntax extensions by setting the
filetype from a |modeline| or in a personal filetype definitions file
(see |filetype.txt|).


HASKELL			     *haskell.vim* *lhaskell.vim* *ft-haskell-syntax*

The Haskell syntax files support plain Haskell code as well as literate
Haskell code, the latter in both Bird style and TeX style.  The Haskell
syntax highlighting will also highlight C preprocessor directives.

If you want to highlight delimiter characters (useful if you have a
light-coloured background), add to your vimrc: >
	:let hs_highlight_delimiters = 1
To treat True and False as keywords as opposed to ordinary identifiers,
add: >
	:let hs_highlight_boolean = 1
To also treat the names of primitive types as keywords: >
	:let hs_highlight_types = 1
And to treat the names of even more relatively common types as keywords: >
	:let hs_highlight_more_types = 1
If you want to highlight the names of debugging functions, put in
your vimrc: >
	:let hs_highlight_debug = 1

The Haskell syntax highlighting also highlights C preprocessor
directives, and flags lines that start with # but are not valid
directives as erroneous.  This interferes with Haskell's syntax for
operators, as they may start with #.  If you want to highlight those
as operators as opposed to errors, put in your vimrc: >
	:let hs_allow_hash_operator = 1

The syntax highlighting for literate Haskell code will try to
automatically guess whether your literate Haskell code contains
TeX markup or not, and correspondingly highlight TeX constructs
or nothing at all.  You can override this globally by putting
in your vimrc >
	:let lhs_markup = none
for no highlighting at all, or >
	:let lhs_markup = tex
to force the highlighting to always try to highlight TeX markup.
For more flexibility, you may also use buffer local versions of
this variable, so e.g. >
	:let b:lhs_markup = tex
will force TeX highlighting for a particular buffer.  It has to be
set before turning syntax highlighting on for the buffer or
loading a file.


HTML						*html.vim* *ft-html-syntax*

The coloring scheme for tags in the HTML file works as follows.

The  <> of opening tags are colored differently than the </> of a closing tag.
This is on purpose! For opening tags the 'Function' color is used, while for
closing tags the 'Type' color is used (See syntax.vim to check how those are
defined for you)

Known tag names are colored the same way as statements in C.  Unknown tag
names are colored with the same color as the <> or </> respectively which
makes it easy to spot errors

Note that the same is true for argument (or attribute) names.  Known attribute
names are colored differently than unknown ones.

Some HTML tags are used to change the rendering of text.  The following tags
are recognized by the html.vim syntax coloring file and change the way normal
text is shown: <B> <I> <U> <EM> <STRONG> (<EM> is used as an alias for <I>,
while <STRONG> as an alias for <B>), <H1> - <H6>, <HEAD>, <TITLE> and <A>, but
only if used as a link (that is, it must include a href as in
<A href="somefile.html">).

If you want to change how such text is rendered, you must redefine the
following syntax groups:

    - htmlBold
    - htmlBoldUnderline
    - htmlBoldUnderlineItalic
    - htmlUnderline
    - htmlUnderlineItalic
    - htmlItalic
    - htmlTitle for titles
    - htmlH1 - htmlH6 for headings

To make this redefinition work you must redefine them all with the exception
of the last two (htmlTitle and htmlH[1-6], which are optional) and define the
following variable in your vimrc (this is due to the order in which the files
are read during initialization) >
	:let html_my_rendering=1

If you'd like to see an example download mysyntax.vim at
http://www.fleiner.com/vim/download.html

You can also disable this rendering by adding the following line to your
vimrc file: >
	:let html_no_rendering=1

HTML comments are rather special (see an HTML reference document for the
details), and the syntax coloring scheme will highlight all errors.
However, if you prefer to use the wrong style (starts with <!-- and
ends with -->) you can define >
	:let html_wrong_comments=1

JavaScript and Visual Basic embedded inside HTML documents are highlighted as
'Special' with statements, comments, strings and so on colored as in standard
programming languages.  Note that only JavaScript and Visual Basic are currently
supported, no other scripting language has been added yet.

Embedded and inlined cascading style sheets (CSS) are highlighted too.

There are several html preprocessor languages out there.  html.vim has been
written such that it should be trivial to include it.  To do so add the
following two lines to the syntax coloring file for that language
(the example comes from the asp.vim file):

    runtime! syntax/html.vim
    syn cluster htmlPreproc add=asp

Now you just need to make sure that you add all regions that contain
the preprocessor language to the cluster htmlPreproc.


HTML/OS (by Aestiva)				*htmlos.vim* *ft-htmlos-syntax*

The coloring scheme for HTML/OS works as follows:

Functions and variable names are the same color by default, because VIM
doesn't specify different colors for Functions and Identifiers.  To change
this (which is recommended if you want function names to be recognizable in a
different color) you need to add the following line to your vimrc: >
  :hi Function term=underline cterm=bold ctermfg=LightGray

Of course, the ctermfg can be a different color if you choose.

Another issues that HTML/OS runs into is that there is no special filetype to
signify that it is a file with HTML/OS coding.	You can change this by opening
a file and turning on HTML/OS syntax by doing the following: >
  :set syntax=htmlos

Lastly, it should be noted that the opening and closing characters to begin a
block of HTML/OS code can either be << or [[ and >> or ]], respectively.


IA64				*ia64.vim* *intel-itanium* *ft-ia64-syntax*

Highlighting for the Intel Itanium 64 assembly language.  See |asm.vim| for
how to recognize this filetype.

To have *.inc files be recognized as IA64, add this to your vimrc file: >
	:let g:filetype_inc = "ia64"


INFORM						*inform.vim* *ft-inform-syntax*

Inform highlighting includes symbols provided by the Inform Library, as
most programs make extensive use of it.  If do not wish Library symbols
to be highlighted add this to your vim startup: >
	:let inform_highlight_simple=1

By default it is assumed that Inform programs are Z-machine targeted,
and highlights Z-machine assembly language symbols appropriately.  If
you intend your program to be targeted to a Glulx/Glk environment you
need to add this to your startup sequence: >
	:let inform_highlight_glulx=1

This will highlight Glulx opcodes instead, and also adds glk() to the
set of highlighted system functions.

The Inform compiler will flag certain obsolete keywords as errors when
it encounters them.  These keywords are normally highlighted as errors
by Vim.  To prevent such error highlighting, you must add this to your
startup sequence: >
	:let inform_suppress_obsolete=1

By default, the language features highlighted conform to Compiler
version 6.30 and Library version 6.11.  If you are using an older
Inform development environment, you may with to add this to your
startup sequence: >
	:let inform_highlight_old=1

IDL							*idl.vim* *idl-syntax*

IDL (Interface Definition Language) files are used to define RPC calls.  In
Microsoft land, this is also used for defining COM interfaces and calls.

IDL's structure is simple enough to permit a full grammar based approach to
rather than using a few heuristics.  The result is large and somewhat
repetitive but seems to work.

There are some Microsoft extensions to idl files that are here.  Some of them
are disabled by defining idl_no_ms_extensions.

The more complex of the extensions are disabled by defining idl_no_extensions.

Variable			Effect ~

idl_no_ms_extensions		Disable some of the Microsoft specific
				extensions
idl_no_extensions		Disable complex extensions
idlsyntax_showerror		Show IDL errors (can be rather intrusive, but
				quite helpful)
idlsyntax_showerror_soft	Use softer colours by default for errors


JAVA						*java.vim* *ft-java-syntax*

The java.vim syntax highlighting file offers several options:

In Java 1.0.2 it was never possible to have braces inside parens, so this was
flagged as an error.  Since Java 1.1 this is possible (with anonymous
classes), and therefore is no longer marked as an error.  If you prefer the old
way, put the following line into your vim startup file: >
	:let java_mark_braces_in_parens_as_errors=1

All identifiers in java.lang.* are always visible in all classes.  To
highlight them use: >
	:let java_highlight_java_lang_ids=1

You can also highlight identifiers of most standard Java packages if you
download the javaid.vim script at http://www.fleiner.com/vim/download.html.
If you prefer to only highlight identifiers of a certain package, say java.io
use the following: >
	:let java_highlight_java_io=1
Check the javaid.vim file for a list of all the packages that are supported.

Function names are not highlighted, as the way to find functions depends on
how you write Java code.  The syntax file knows two possible ways to highlight
functions:

If you write function declarations that are always indented by either
a tab, 8 spaces or 2 spaces you may want to set >
	:let java_highlight_functions="indent"
However, if you follow the Java guidelines about how functions and classes are
supposed to be named (with respect to upper and lowercase), use >
	:let java_highlight_functions="style"
If both options do not work for you, but you would still want function
declarations to be highlighted create your own definitions by changing the
definitions in java.vim or by creating your own java.vim which includes the
original one and then adds the code to highlight functions.

In Java 1.1 the functions System.out.println() and System.err.println() should
only be used for debugging.  Therefore it is possible to highlight debugging
statements differently.  To do this you must add the following definition in
your startup file: >
	:let java_highlight_debug=1
The result will be that those statements are highlighted as 'Special'
characters.  If you prefer to have them highlighted differently you must define
new highlightings for the following groups.:
    Debug, DebugSpecial, DebugString, DebugBoolean, DebugType
which are used for the statement itself, special characters used in debug
strings, strings, boolean constants and types (this, super) respectively.  I
have opted to chose another background for those statements.

Javadoc is a program that takes special comments out of Java program files and
creates HTML pages.  The standard configuration will highlight this HTML code
similarly to HTML files (see |html.vim|).  You can even add Javascript
and CSS inside this code (see below).  There are four differences however:
  1. The title (all characters up to the first '.' which is followed by
     some white space or up to the first '@') is colored differently (to change
     the color change the group CommentTitle).
  2. The text is colored as 'Comment'.
  3. HTML comments are colored as 'Special'
  4. The special Javadoc tags (@see, @param, ...) are highlighted as specials
     and the argument (for @see, @param, @exception) as Function.
To turn this feature off add the following line to your startup file: >
	:let java_ignore_javadoc=1

If you use the special Javadoc comment highlighting described above you
can also turn on special highlighting for Javascript, visual basic
scripts and embedded CSS (stylesheets).  This makes only sense if you
actually have Javadoc comments that include either Javascript or embedded
CSS.  The options to use are >
	:let java_javascript=1
	:let java_css=1
	:let java_vb=1

In order to highlight nested parens with different colors define colors
for javaParen, javaParen1 and javaParen2, for example with >
	:hi link javaParen Comment
or >
	:hi javaParen ctermfg=blue guifg=#0000ff

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "java_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >
	:let java_minlines = 50
This will make the syntax synchronization start 50 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 10.  The disadvantage of using a larger
number is that redrawing can become slow.


LACE						*lace.vim* *ft-lace-syntax*

Lace (Language for Assembly of Classes in Eiffel) is case insensitive, but the
style guide lines are not.  If you prefer case insensitive highlighting, just
define the vim variable 'lace_case_insensitive' in your startup file: >
	:let lace_case_insensitive=1


LEX						*lex.vim* *ft-lex-syntax*

Lex uses brute-force synchronizing as the "^%%$" section delimiter
gives no clue as to what section follows.  Consequently, the value for >
	:syn sync minlines=300
may be changed by the user if s/he is experiencing synchronization
difficulties (such as may happen with large lex files).


LIFELINES				*lifelines.vim* *ft-lifelines-syntax*

To highlight deprecated functions as errors, add in your vimrc: >

	:let g:lifelines_deprecated = 1
<

LISP						*lisp.vim* *ft-lisp-syntax*

The lisp syntax highlighting provides two options: >

	g:lisp_instring : if it exists, then "(...)" strings are highlighted
			  as if the contents of the string were lisp.
			  Useful for AutoLisp.
	g:lisp_rainbow  : if it exists and is nonzero, then differing levels
			  of parenthesization will receive different
			  highlighting.
<
The g:lisp_rainbow option provides 10 levels of individual colorization for
the parentheses and backquoted parentheses.  Because of the quantity of
colorization levels, unlike non-rainbow highlighting, the rainbow mode
specifies its highlighting using ctermfg and guifg, thereby bypassing the
usual colorscheme control using standard highlighting groups.  The actual
highlighting used depends on the dark/bright setting  (see |'bg'|).


LITE						*lite.vim* *ft-lite-syntax*

There are two options for the lite syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings, use this: >

	:let lite_sql_query = 1

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "lite_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let lite_minlines = 200


LPC						*lpc.vim* *ft-lpc-syntax*

LPC stands for a simple, memory-efficient language: Lars Pensj| C.  The
file name of LPC is usually *.c.  Recognizing these files as LPC would bother
users writing only C programs.	If you want to use LPC syntax in Vim, you
should set a variable in your vimrc file: >

	:let lpc_syntax_for_c = 1

If it doesn't work properly for some particular C or LPC files, use a
modeline.  For a LPC file:

	// vim:set ft=lpc:

For a C file that is recognized as LPC:

	// vim:set ft=c:

If you don't want to set the variable, use the modeline in EVERY LPC file.

There are several implementations for LPC, we intend to support most widely
used ones.  Here the default LPC syntax is for MudOS series, for MudOS v22
and before, you should turn off the sensible modifiers, and this will also
assert the new efuns after v22 to be invalid, don't set this variable when
you are using the latest version of MudOS: >

	:let lpc_pre_v22 = 1

For LpMud 3.2 series of LPC: >

	:let lpc_compat_32 = 1

For LPC4 series of LPC: >

	:let lpc_use_lpc4_syntax = 1

For uLPC series of LPC:
uLPC has been developed to Pike, so you should use Pike syntax
instead, and the name of your source file should be *.pike


LUA						*lua.vim* *ft-lua-syntax*

The Lua syntax file can be used for versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2 (5.2 is
the default). You can select one of these versions using the global variables
lua_version and lua_subversion. For example, to activate Lua
5.1 syntax highlighting, set the variables like this:

	:let lua_version = 5
	:let lua_subversion = 1


MAIL						*mail.vim* *ft-mail.vim*

Vim highlights all the standard elements of an email (headers, signatures,
quoted text and URLs / email addresses).  In keeping with standard conventions,
signatures begin in a line containing only "--" followed optionally by
whitespaces and end with a newline.

Vim treats lines beginning with ']', '}', '|', '>' or a word followed by '>'
as quoted text.  However Vim highlights headers and signatures in quoted text
only if the text is quoted with '>' (optionally followed by one space).

By default mail.vim synchronises syntax to 100 lines before the first
displayed line.  If you have a slow machine, and generally deal with emails
with short headers, you can change this to a smaller value: >

    :let mail_minlines = 30


MAKE						*make.vim* *ft-make-syntax*

In makefiles, commands are usually highlighted to make it easy for you to spot
errors.  However, this may be too much coloring for you.  You can turn this
feature off by using: >

	:let make_no_commands = 1


MAPLE						*maple.vim* *ft-maple-syntax*

Maple V, by Waterloo Maple Inc, supports symbolic algebra.  The language
supports many packages of functions which are selectively loaded by the user.
The standard set of packages' functions as supplied in Maple V release 4 may be
highlighted at the user's discretion.  Users may place in their vimrc file: >

	:let mvpkg_all= 1

to get all package functions highlighted, or users may select any subset by
choosing a variable/package from the table below and setting that variable to
1, also in their vimrc file (prior to sourcing
$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim).

	Table of Maple V Package Function Selectors >
  mv_DEtools	 mv_genfunc	mv_networks	mv_process
  mv_Galois	 mv_geometry	mv_numapprox	mv_simplex
  mv_GaussInt	 mv_grobner	mv_numtheory	mv_stats
  mv_LREtools	 mv_group	mv_orthopoly	mv_student
  mv_combinat	 mv_inttrans	mv_padic	mv_sumtools
  mv_combstruct mv_liesymm	mv_plots	mv_tensor
  mv_difforms	 mv_linalg	mv_plottools	mv_totorder
  mv_finance	 mv_logic	mv_powseries


MATHEMATICA		*mma.vim* *ft-mma-syntax* *ft-mathematica-syntax*

Empty *.m files will automatically be presumed to be Matlab files unless you
have the following in your vimrc: >

	let filetype_m = "mma"


MOO						*moo.vim* *ft-moo-syntax*

If you use C-style comments inside expressions and find it mangles your
highlighting, you may want to use extended (slow!) matches for C-style
comments: >

	:let moo_extended_cstyle_comments = 1

To disable highlighting of pronoun substitution patterns inside strings: >

	:let moo_no_pronoun_sub = 1

To disable highlighting of the regular expression operator '%|', and matching
'%(' and '%)' inside strings: >

	:let moo_no_regexp = 1

Unmatched double quotes can be recognized and highlighted as errors: >

	:let moo_unmatched_quotes = 1

To highlight builtin properties (.name, .location, .programmer etc.): >

	:let moo_builtin_properties = 1

Unknown builtin functions can be recognized and highlighted as errors.  If you
use this option, add your own extensions to the mooKnownBuiltinFunction group.
To enable this option: >

	:let moo_unknown_builtin_functions = 1

An example of adding sprintf() to the list of known builtin functions: >

	:syn keyword mooKnownBuiltinFunction sprintf contained


MSQL						*msql.vim* *ft-msql-syntax*

There are two options for the msql syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings, use this: >

	:let msql_sql_query = 1

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "msql_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let msql_minlines = 200


NCF						*ncf.vim* *ft-ncf-syntax*

There is one option for NCF syntax highlighting.

If you want to have unrecognized (by ncf.vim) statements highlighted as
errors, use this: >

	:let ncf_highlight_unknowns = 1

If you don't want to highlight these errors, leave it unset.


NROFF						*nroff.vim* *ft-nroff-syntax*

The nroff syntax file works with AT&T n/troff out of the box.  You need to
activate the GNU groff extra features included in the syntax file before you
can use them.

For example, Linux and BSD distributions use groff as their default text
processing package.  In order to activate the extra syntax highlighting
features for groff, add the following option to your start-up files: >

  :let b:nroff_is_groff = 1

Groff is different from the old AT&T n/troff that you may still find in
Solaris.  Groff macro and request names can be longer than 2 characters and
there are extensions to the language primitives.  For example, in AT&T troff
you access the year as a 2-digit number with the request \(yr.  In groff you
can use the same request, recognized for compatibility, or you can use groff's
native syntax, \[yr].  Furthermore, you can use a 4-digit year directly:
\[year].  Macro requests can be longer than 2 characters, for example, GNU mm
accepts the requests ".VERBON" and ".VERBOFF" for creating verbatim
environments.

In order to obtain the best formatted output g/troff can give you, you should
follow a few simple rules about spacing and punctuation.

1. Do not leave empty spaces at the end of lines.

2. Leave one space and one space only after an end-of-sentence period,
   exclamation mark, etc.

3. For reasons stated below, it is best to follow all period marks with a
   carriage return.

The reason behind these unusual tips is that g/n/troff have a line breaking
algorithm that can be easily upset if you don't follow the rules given above.

Unlike TeX, troff fills text line-by-line, not paragraph-by-paragraph and,
furthermore, it does not have a concept of glue or stretch, all horizontal and
vertical space input will be output as is.

Therefore, you should be careful about not using more space between sentences
than you intend to have in your final document.  For this reason, the common
practice is to insert a carriage return immediately after all punctuation
marks.  If you want to have "even" text in your final processed output, you
need to maintain regular spacing in the input text.  To mark both trailing
spaces and two or more spaces after a punctuation as an error, use: >

  :let nroff_space_errors = 1

Another technique to detect extra spacing and other errors that will interfere
with the correct typesetting of your file, is to define an eye-catching
highlighting definition for the syntax groups "nroffDefinition" and
"nroffDefSpecial" in your configuration files.  For example: >

  hi def nroffDefinition term=italic cterm=italic gui=reverse
  hi def nroffDefSpecial term=italic,bold cterm=italic,bold
			 \ gui=reverse,bold

If you want to navigate preprocessor entries in your source file as easily as
with section markers, you can activate the following option in your vimrc
file: >

	let b:preprocs_as_sections = 1

As well, the syntax file adds an extra paragraph marker for the extended
paragraph macro (.XP) in the ms package.

Finally, there is a |groff.vim| syntax file that can be used for enabling
groff syntax highlighting either on a file basis or globally by default.


OCAML						*ocaml.vim* *ft-ocaml-syntax*

The OCaml syntax file handles files having the following prefixes: .ml,
.mli, .mll and .mly.  By setting the following variable >

	:let ocaml_revised = 1

you can switch from standard OCaml-syntax to revised syntax as supported
by the camlp4 preprocessor.  Setting the variable >

	:let ocaml_noend_error = 1

prevents highlighting of "end" as error, which is useful when sources
contain very long structures that Vim does not synchronize anymore.


PAPP						*papp.vim* *ft-papp-syntax*

The PApp syntax file handles .papp files and, to a lesser extend, .pxml
and .pxsl files which are all a mixture of perl/xml/html/other using xml
as the top-level file format.  By default everything inside phtml or pxml
sections is treated as a string with embedded preprocessor commands.  If
you set the variable: >

	:let papp_include_html=1

in your startup file it will try to syntax-hilight html code inside phtml
sections, but this is relatively slow and much too colourful to be able to
edit sensibly. ;)

The newest version of the papp.vim syntax file can usually be found at
http://papp.plan9.de.


PASCAL						*pascal.vim* *ft-pascal-syntax*

Files matching "*.p" could be Progress or Pascal.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit Progress at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >

   :let filetype_p = "pascal"

The Pascal syntax file has been extended to take into account some extensions
provided by Turbo Pascal, Free Pascal Compiler and GNU Pascal Compiler.
Delphi keywords are also supported.  By default, Turbo Pascal 7.0 features are
enabled.  If you prefer to stick with the standard Pascal keywords, add the
following line to your startup file: >

   :let pascal_traditional=1

To switch on Delphi specific constructions (such as one-line comments,
keywords, etc): >

   :let pascal_delphi=1


The option pascal_symbol_operator controls whether symbol operators such as +,
*, .., etc. are displayed using the Operator color or not.  To colorize symbol
operators, add the following line to your startup file: >

   :let pascal_symbol_operator=1

Some functions are highlighted by default.  To switch it off: >

   :let pascal_no_functions=1

Furthermore, there are specific variables for some compilers.  Besides
pascal_delphi, there are pascal_gpc and pascal_fpc.  Default extensions try to
match Turbo Pascal. >

   :let pascal_gpc=1

or >

   :let pascal_fpc=1

To ensure that strings are defined on a single line, you can define the
pascal_one_line_string variable. >

   :let pascal_one_line_string=1

If you dislike <Tab> chars, you can set the pascal_no_tabs variable.  Tabs
will be highlighted as Error. >

   :let pascal_no_tabs=1



PERL						*perl.vim* *ft-perl-syntax*

There are a number of possible options to the perl syntax highlighting.

Inline POD highlighting is now turned on by default.  If you don't wish
to have the added complexity of highlighting POD embedded within Perl
files, you may set the 'perl_include_pod' option to 0: >

	:let perl_include_pod = 0

To reduce the complexity of parsing (and increase performance) you can switch
off two elements in the parsing of variable names and contents. >

To handle package references in variable and function names not differently
from the rest of the name (like 'PkgName::' in '$PkgName::VarName'): >

	:let perl_no_scope_in_variables = 1

(In Vim 6.x it was the other way around: "perl_want_scope_in_variables"
enabled it.)

If you do not want complex things like '@{${"foo"}}' to be parsed: >

	:let perl_no_extended_vars = 1

(In Vim 6.x it was the other way around: "perl_extended_vars" enabled it.)

The coloring strings can be changed.  By default strings and qq friends will be
highlighted like the first line.  If you set the variable
perl_string_as_statement, it will be highlighted as in the second line.

   "hello world!"; qq|hello world|;
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^NN^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^N	  (unlet perl_string_as_statement)
   S^^^^^^^^^^^^SNNSSS^^^^^^^^^^^SN	  (let perl_string_as_statement)

(^ = perlString, S = perlStatement, N = None at all)

The syncing has 3 options.  The first two switch off some triggering of
synchronization and should only be needed in case it fails to work properly.
If while scrolling all of a sudden the whole screen changes color completely
then you should try and switch off one of those.  Let me know if you can figure
out the line that causes the mistake.

One triggers on "^\s*sub\s*" and the other on "^[$@%]" more or less. >

	:let perl_no_sync_on_sub
	:let perl_no_sync_on_global_var

Below you can set the maximum distance VIM should look for starting points for
its attempts in syntax highlighting. >

	:let perl_sync_dist = 100

If you want to use folding with perl, set perl_fold: >

	:let perl_fold = 1

If you want to fold blocks in if statements, etc. as well set the following: >

	:let perl_fold_blocks = 1

Subroutines are folded by default if 'perl_fold' is set.  If you do not want
this, you can set 'perl_nofold_subs': >

	:let perl_nofold_subs = 1

Anonymous subroutines are not folded by default; you may enable their folding
via 'perl_fold_anonymous_subs': >

	:let perl_fold_anonymous_subs = 1

Packages are also folded by default if 'perl_fold' is set.  To disable this
behavior, set 'perl_nofold_packages': >

	:let perl_nofold_packages = 1

PHP3 and PHP4		*php.vim* *php3.vim* *ft-php-syntax* *ft-php3-syntax*

[note: previously this was called "php3", but since it now also supports php4
it has been renamed to "php"]

There are the following options for the php syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings: >

  let php_sql_query = 1

For highlighting the Baselib methods: >

  let php_baselib = 1

Enable HTML syntax highlighting inside strings: >

  let php_htmlInStrings = 1

Using the old colorstyle: >

  let php_oldStyle = 1

Enable highlighting ASP-style short tags: >

  let php_asp_tags = 1

Disable short tags: >

  let php_noShortTags = 1

For highlighting parent error ] or ): >

  let php_parent_error_close = 1

For skipping a php end tag, if there exists an open ( or [ without a closing
one: >

  let php_parent_error_open = 1

Enable folding for classes and functions: >

  let php_folding = 1

Selecting syncing method: >

  let php_sync_method = x

x = -1 to sync by search (default),
x > 0 to sync at least x lines backwards,
x = 0 to sync from start.


PLAINTEX				*plaintex.vim* *ft-plaintex-syntax*

TeX is a typesetting language, and plaintex is the file type for the "plain"
variant of TeX.  If you never want your *.tex files recognized as plain TeX,
see |ft-tex-plugin|.

This syntax file has the option >

	let g:plaintex_delimiters = 1

if you want to highlight brackets "[]" and braces "{}".


PPWIZARD					*ppwiz.vim* *ft-ppwiz-syntax*

PPWizard is a preprocessor for HTML and OS/2 INF files

This syntax file has the options:

- ppwiz_highlight_defs : determines highlighting mode for PPWizard's
  definitions.  Possible values are

  ppwiz_highlight_defs = 1 : PPWizard #define statements retain the
    colors of their contents (e.g. PPWizard macros and variables)

  ppwiz_highlight_defs = 2 : preprocessor #define and #evaluate
    statements are shown in a single color with the exception of line
    continuation symbols

  The default setting for ppwiz_highlight_defs is 1.

- ppwiz_with_html : If the value is 1 (the default), highlight literal
  HTML code; if 0, treat HTML code like ordinary text.


PHTML						*phtml.vim* *ft-phtml-syntax*

There are two options for the phtml syntax highlighting.

If you like SQL syntax highlighting inside Strings, use this: >

	:let phtml_sql_query = 1

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "phtml_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let phtml_minlines = 200


POSTSCRIPT				*postscr.vim* *ft-postscr-syntax*

There are several options when it comes to highlighting PostScript.

First which version of the PostScript language to highlight.  There are
currently three defined language versions, or levels.  Level 1 is the original
and base version, and includes all extensions prior to the release of level 2.
Level 2 is the most common version around, and includes its own set of
extensions prior to the release of level 3.  Level 3 is currently the highest
level supported.  You select which level of the PostScript language you want
highlighted by defining the postscr_level variable as follows: >

	:let postscr_level=2

If this variable is not defined it defaults to 2 (level 2) since this is
the most prevalent version currently.

Note, not all PS interpreters will support all language features for a
particular language level.  In particular the %!PS-Adobe-3.0 at the start of
PS files does NOT mean the PostScript present is level 3 PostScript!

If you are working with Display PostScript, you can include highlighting of
Display PS language features by defining the postscr_display variable as
follows: >

	:let postscr_display=1

If you are working with Ghostscript, you can include highlighting of
Ghostscript specific language features by defining the variable
postscr_ghostscript as follows: >

	:let postscr_ghostscript=1

PostScript is a large language, with many predefined elements.	While it
useful to have all these elements highlighted, on slower machines this can
cause Vim to slow down.  In an attempt to be machine friendly font names and
character encodings are not highlighted by default.  Unless you are working
explicitly with either of these this should be ok.  If you want them to be
highlighted you should set one or both of the following variables: >

	:let postscr_fonts=1
	:let postscr_encodings=1

There is a stylistic option to the highlighting of and, or, and not.  In
PostScript the function of these operators depends on the types of their
operands - if the operands are booleans then they are the logical operators,
if they are integers then they are binary operators.  As binary and logical
operators can be highlighted differently they have to be highlighted one way
or the other.  By default they are treated as logical operators.  They can be
highlighted as binary operators by defining the variable
postscr_andornot_binary as follows: >

	:let postscr_andornot_binary=1
<

			*ptcap.vim* *ft-printcap-syntax*
PRINTCAP + TERMCAP	*ft-ptcap-syntax* *ft-termcap-syntax*

This syntax file applies to the printcap and termcap databases.

In order for Vim to recognize printcap/termcap files that do not match
the patterns *printcap*, or *termcap*, you must put additional patterns
appropriate to your system in your |myfiletypefile| file.  For these
patterns, you must set the variable "b:ptcap_type" to either "print" or
"term", and then the 'filetype' option to ptcap.

For example, to make Vim identify all files in /etc/termcaps/ as termcap
files, add the following: >

   :au BufNewFile,BufRead /etc/termcaps/* let b:ptcap_type = "term" |
				       \ set filetype=ptcap

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which
are fixed when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "ptcap_minlines"
internal variable to a larger number: >

   :let ptcap_minlines = 50

(The default is 20 lines.)


PROGRESS				*progress.vim* *ft-progress-syntax*

Files matching "*.w" could be Progress or cweb.  If the automatic detection
doesn't work for you, or you don't edit cweb at all, use this in your
startup vimrc: >
   :let filetype_w = "progress"
The same happens for "*.i", which could be assembly, and "*.p", which could be
Pascal.  Use this if you don't use assembly and Pascal: >
   :let filetype_i = "progress"
   :let filetype_p = "progress"


PYTHON						*python.vim* *ft-python-syntax*

There are six options to control Python syntax highlighting.

For highlighted numbers: >
	:let python_no_number_highlight = 1

For highlighted builtin functions: >
	:let python_no_builtin_highlight = 1

For highlighted standard exceptions: >
	:let python_no_exception_highlight = 1

For highlighted doctests and code inside: >
	:let python_no_doctest_highlight = 1
or >
	:let python_no_doctest_code_highlight = 1
(first option implies second one).

For highlighted trailing whitespace and mix of spaces and tabs: >
	:let python_space_error_highlight = 1

If you want all possible Python highlighting (the same as setting the
preceding last option and unsetting all other ones): >
	:let python_highlight_all = 1

Note: only existence of these options matter, not their value. You can replace
      1 above with anything.


QUAKE						*quake.vim* *ft-quake-syntax*

The Quake syntax definition should work for most any FPS (First Person
Shooter) based on one of the Quake engines.  However, the command names vary
a bit between the three games (Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 Arena) so the
syntax definition checks for the existence of three global variables to allow
users to specify what commands are legal in their files.  The three variables
can be set for the following effects:

set to highlight commands only available in Quake: >
	:let quake_is_quake1 = 1

set to highlight commands only available in Quake 2: >
	:let quake_is_quake2 = 1

set to highlight commands only available in Quake 3 Arena: >
	:let quake_is_quake3 = 1

Any combination of these three variables is legal, but might highlight more
commands than are actually available to you by the game.


READLINE				*readline.vim* *ft-readline-syntax*

The readline library is primarily used by the BASH shell, which adds quite a
few commands and options to the ones already available.  To highlight these
items as well you can add the following to your |vimrc| or just type it in the
command line before loading a file with the readline syntax: >
	let readline_has_bash = 1

This will add highlighting for the commands that BASH (version 2.05a and
later, and part earlier) adds.


RESTRUCTURED TEXT			*rst.vim* *ft-rst-syntax*

You may set what syntax definitions should be used for code blocks via
	let rst_syntax_code_list = ['vim', 'lisp', ...]


REXX						*rexx.vim* *ft-rexx-syntax*

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "rexx_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >
	:let rexx_minlines = 50
This will make the syntax synchronization start 50 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 10.  The disadvantage of using a larger
number is that redrawing can become slow.

Vim tries to guess what type a ".r" file is.  If it can't be detected (from
comment lines), the default is "r".  To make the default rexx add this line to
your vimrc:							*g:filetype_r*
>
	:let g:filetype_r = "r"


RUBY						*ruby.vim* *ft-ruby-syntax*

There are a number of options to the Ruby syntax highlighting.

By default, the "end" keyword is colorized according to the opening statement
of the block it closes.  While useful, this feature can be expensive; if you
experience slow redrawing (or you are on a terminal with poor color support)
you may want to turn it off by defining the "ruby_no_expensive" variable: >

	:let ruby_no_expensive = 1
<
In this case the same color will be used for all control keywords.

If you do want this feature enabled, but notice highlighting errors while
scrolling backwards, which are fixed when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting
the "ruby_minlines" variable to a value larger than 50: >

	:let ruby_minlines = 100
<
Ideally, this value should be a number of lines large enough to embrace your
largest class or module.

Highlighting of special identifiers can be disabled by removing the
rubyIdentifier highlighting: >

	:hi link rubyIdentifier NONE
<
This will prevent highlighting of special identifiers like "ConstantName",
"$global_var", "@@class_var", "@instance_var", "| block_param |", and
":symbol".

Significant methods of Kernel, Module and Object are highlighted by default.
This can be disabled by defining "ruby_no_special_methods": >

	:let ruby_no_special_methods = 1
<
This will prevent highlighting of important methods such as "require", "attr",
"private", "raise" and "proc".

Ruby operators can be highlighted. This is enabled by defining
"ruby_operators": >

	:let ruby_operators = 1
<
Whitespace errors can be highlighted by defining "ruby_space_errors": >

	:let ruby_space_errors = 1
<
This will highlight trailing whitespace and tabs preceded by a space character
as errors.  This can be refined by defining "ruby_no_trail_space_error" and
"ruby_no_tab_space_error" which will ignore trailing whitespace and tabs after
spaces respectively.

Folding can be enabled by defining "ruby_fold": >

	:let ruby_fold = 1
<
This will set the 'foldmethod' option to "syntax" and allow folding of
classes, modules, methods, code blocks, heredocs and comments.

Folding of multiline comments can be disabled by defining
"ruby_no_comment_fold": >

	:let ruby_no_comment_fold = 1
<

SCHEME						*scheme.vim* *ft-scheme-syntax*

By default only R5RS keywords are highlighted and properly indented.

MzScheme-specific stuff will be used if b:is_mzscheme or g:is_mzscheme
variables are defined.

Also scheme.vim supports keywords of the Chicken Scheme->C compiler.  Define
b:is_chicken or g:is_chicken, if you need them.


SDL						*sdl.vim* *ft-sdl-syntax*

The SDL highlighting probably misses a few keywords, but SDL has so many
of them it's almost impossibly to cope.

The new standard, SDL-2000, specifies that all identifiers are
case-sensitive (which was not so before), and that all keywords can be
used either completely lowercase or completely uppercase.  To have the
highlighting reflect this, you can set the following variable: >
	:let sdl_2000=1

This also sets many new keywords.  If you want to disable the old
keywords, which is probably a good idea, use: >
	:let SDL_no_96=1


The indentation is probably also incomplete, but right now I am very
satisfied with it for my own projects.


SED						*sed.vim* *ft-sed-syntax*

To make tabs stand out from regular blanks (accomplished by using Todo
highlighting on the tabs), define "highlight_sedtabs" by putting >

	:let highlight_sedtabs = 1

in the vimrc file.  (This special highlighting only applies for tabs
inside search patterns, replacement texts, addresses or text included
by an Append/Change/Insert command.)  If you enable this option, it is
also a good idea to set the tab width to one character; by doing that,
you can easily count the number of tabs in a string.

Bugs:

  The transform command (y) is treated exactly like the substitute
  command.  This means that, as far as this syntax file is concerned,
  transform accepts the same flags as substitute, which is wrong.
  (Transform accepts no flags.)  I tolerate this bug because the
  involved commands need very complex treatment (95 patterns, one for
  each plausible pattern delimiter).


SGML						*sgml.vim* *ft-sgml-syntax*

The coloring scheme for tags in the SGML file works as follows.

The <> of opening tags are colored differently than the </> of a closing tag.
This is on purpose! For opening tags the 'Function' color is used, while for
closing tags the 'Type' color is used (See syntax.vim to check how those are
defined for you)

Known tag names are colored the same way as statements in C.  Unknown tag
names are not colored which makes it easy to spot errors.

Note that the same is true for argument (or attribute) names.  Known attribute
names are colored differently than unknown ones.

Some SGML tags are used to change the rendering of text.  The following tags
are recognized by the sgml.vim syntax coloring file and change the way normal
text is shown: <varname> <emphasis> <command> <function> <literal>
<replaceable> <ulink> and <link>.

If you want to change how such text is rendered, you must redefine the
following syntax groups:

    - sgmlBold
    - sgmlBoldItalic
    - sgmlUnderline
    - sgmlItalic
    - sgmlLink for links

To make this redefinition work you must redefine them all and define the
following variable in your vimrc (this is due to the order in which the files
are read during initialization) >
   let sgml_my_rendering=1

You can also disable this rendering by adding the following line to your
vimrc file: >
   let sgml_no_rendering=1

(Adapted from the html.vim help text by Claudio Fleiner <claudio@fleiner.com>)


SH		*sh.vim* *ft-sh-syntax* *ft-bash-syntax* *ft-ksh-syntax*

This covers the "normal" Unix (Bourne) sh, bash and the Korn shell.

Vim attempts to determine which shell type is in use by specifying that
various filenames are of specific types: >

    ksh : .kshrc* *.ksh
    bash: .bashrc* bashrc bash.bashrc .bash_profile* *.bash
<
If none of these cases pertain, then the first line of the file is examined
(ex. /bin/sh  /bin/ksh	/bin/bash).  If the first line specifies a shelltype,
then that shelltype is used.  However some files (ex. .profile) are known to
be shell files but the type is not apparent.  Furthermore, on many systems
sh is symbolically linked to "bash" (Linux, Windows+cygwin) or "ksh" (Posix).

One may specify a global default by instantiating one of the following three
variables in your vimrc:

    ksh: >
	let g:is_kornshell = 1
<   posix: (using this is the same as setting is_kornshell to 1) >
	let g:is_posix     = 1
<   bash: >
	let g:is_bash	   = 1
<   sh: (default) Bourne shell >
	let g:is_sh	   = 1

If there's no "#! ..." line, and the user hasn't availed himself/herself of a
default sh.vim syntax setting as just shown, then syntax/sh.vim will assume
the Bourne shell syntax.  No need to quote RFCs or market penetration
statistics in error reports, please -- just select the default version of the
sh your system uses in your vimrc.

The syntax/sh.vim file provides several levels of syntax-based folding: >

	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 0     (default, no syntax folding)
	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 1     (enable function folding)
	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 2     (enable heredoc folding)
	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 4     (enable if/do/for folding)
>
then various syntax items (HereDocuments and function bodies) become
syntax-foldable (see |:syn-fold|).  You also may add these together
to get multiple types of folding: >

	let g:sh_fold_enabled= 3     (enables function and heredoc folding)

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards which are fixed
when one redraws with CTRL-L, try setting the "sh_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number.  Example: >

	let sh_minlines = 500

This will make syntax synchronization start 500 lines before the first
displayed line.  The default value is 200.  The disadvantage of using a larger
number is that redrawing can become slow.

If you don't have much to synchronize on, displaying can be very slow.	To
reduce this, the "sh_maxlines" internal variable can be set.  Example: >

	let sh_maxlines = 100
<
The default is to use the twice sh_minlines.  Set it to a smaller number to
speed up displaying.  The disadvantage is that highlight errors may appear.

						*g:sh_isk* *g:sh_noisk*
The shell languages appear to let "." be part of words, commands, etc;
consequently it should be in the isk for sh.vim.  As of v116 of syntax/sh.vim,
syntax/sh.vim will append the "." to |'iskeyword'| by default; you may control
this behavior with: >
	let g:sh_isk  = '..whatever characters you want as part of iskeyword'
	let g:sh_noisk= 1  " otherwise, if this exists, the isk will NOT chg
<
						*sh-embed*  *sh-awk*
 Sh: EMBEDDING LANGUAGES~

You may wish to embed languages into sh.  I'll give an example courtesy of
Lorance Stinson on how to do this with awk as an example. Put the following
file into $HOME/.config/nvim/after/syntax/sh/awkembed.vim: >

    " AWK Embedding:
    " ==============
    " Shamelessly ripped from aspperl.vim by Aaron Hope.
    if exists("b:current_syntax")
      unlet b:current_syntax
    endif
    syn include @AWKScript syntax/awk.vim
    syn region AWKScriptCode matchgroup=AWKCommand start=+[=\\]\@<!'+ skip=+\\'+ end=+'+ contains=@AWKScript contained
    syn region AWKScriptEmbedded matchgroup=AWKCommand start=+\<awk\>+ skip=+\\$+ end=+[=\\]\@<!'+me=e-1 contains=@shIdList,@shExprList2 nextgroup=AWKScriptCode
    syn cluster shCommandSubList add=AWKScriptEmbedded
    hi def link AWKCommand Type
<
This code will then let the awk code in the single quotes: >
	awk '...awk code here...'
be highlighted using the awk highlighting syntax.  Clearly this may be
extended to other languages.


SPEEDUP						*spup.vim* *ft-spup-syntax*
(AspenTech plant simulator)

The Speedup syntax file has some options:

- strict_subsections : If this variable is defined, only keywords for
  sections and subsections will be highlighted as statements but not
  other keywords (like WITHIN in the OPERATION section).

- highlight_types : Definition of this variable causes stream types
  like temperature or pressure to be highlighted as Type, not as a
  plain Identifier.  Included are the types that are usually found in
  the DECLARE section; if you defined own types, you have to include
  them in the syntax file.

- oneline_comments : this value ranges from 1 to 3 and determines the
  highlighting of # style comments.

  oneline_comments = 1 : allow normal Speedup code after an even
  number of #s.

  oneline_comments = 2 : show code starting with the second # as
  error.  This is the default setting.

  oneline_comments = 3 : show the whole line as error if it contains
  more than one #.

Since especially OPERATION sections tend to become very large due to
PRESETting variables, syncing may be critical.  If your computer is
fast enough, you can increase minlines and/or maxlines near the end of
the syntax file.


SQL						*sql.vim* *ft-sql-syntax*
				*sqlinformix.vim* *ft-sqlinformix-syntax*
				*sqlanywhere.vim* *ft-sqlanywhere-syntax*

While there is an ANSI standard for SQL, most database engines add their own
custom extensions.  Vim currently supports the Oracle and Informix dialects of
SQL.  Vim assumes "*.sql" files are Oracle SQL by default.

Vim currently has SQL support for a variety of different vendors via syntax
scripts.  You can change Vim's default from Oracle to any of the current SQL
supported types.  You can also easily alter the SQL dialect being used on a
buffer by buffer basis.

For more detailed instructions see |ft_sql.txt|.


TCSH						*tcsh.vim* *ft-tcsh-syntax*

This covers the shell named "tcsh".  It is a superset of csh.  See |csh.vim|
for how the filetype is detected.

Tcsh does not allow \" in strings unless the "backslash_quote" shell variable
is set.  If you want VIM to assume that no backslash quote constructs exist add
this line to your vimrc: >

	:let tcsh_backslash_quote = 0

If you notice highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, which are fixed
when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting the "tcsh_minlines" internal variable
to a larger number: >

	:let tcsh_minlines = 1000

This will make the syntax synchronization start 1000 lines before the first
displayed line.  If you set "tcsh_minlines" to "fromstart", then
synchronization is done from the start of the file. The default value for
tcsh_minlines is 100.  The disadvantage of using a larger number is that
redrawing can become slow.

 Tex: Want Syntax Folding? ~

As of version 28 of <syntax/tex.vim>, syntax-based folding of parts, chapters,
sections, subsections, etc are supported.  Put >
	let g:tex_fold_enabled=1
in your vimrc, and :set fdm=syntax.  I suggest doing the latter via a
modeline at the end of your LaTeX file: >
	% vim: fdm=syntax

	https://vimhelp.appspot.com/vim_faq.txt.html#faq-29.7
<
						*g:tex_nospell*
 Tex: No Spell Checking Wanted~

If you don't want spell checking anywhere in your LaTeX document, put >
	let g:tex_nospell=1
into your vimrc.  If you merely wish to suppress spell checking inside
comments only, see |g:tex_comment_nospell|.

				*tex-nospell* *g:tex_comment_nospell*
 Tex: Don't Want Spell Checking In Comments? ~

Some folks like to include things like source code in comments and so would
prefer that spell checking be disabled in comments in LaTeX files.  To do
this, put the following in your vimrc: >
      let g:tex_comment_nospell= 1
If you want to suppress spell checking everywhere inside your LaTeX document,
see |g:tex_nospell|.

				*tex-verb* *g:tex_verbspell*
 Tex: Want Spell Checking in Verbatim Zones?~

Often verbatim regions are used for things like source code; seldom does
one want source code spell-checked.  However, for those of you who do
want your verbatim zones spell-checked, put the following in your vimrc: >
	let g:tex_verbspell= 1
<
					*tex-runon* *tex-stopzone*
 Tex: Run-on Comments or MathZones ~

The <syntax/tex.vim> highlighting supports TeX, LaTeX, and some AmsTeX.  The
highlighting supports three primary zones/regions: normal, texZone, and
texMathZone.  Although considerable effort has been made to have these zones
terminate properly, zones delineated by $..$ and $$..$$ cannot be synchronized
as there's no difference between start and end patterns.  Consequently, a
special "TeX comment" has been provided >
	%stopzone
which will forcibly terminate the highlighting of either a texZone or a
texMathZone.

					*tex-slow* *tex-sync*
 Tex: Slow Syntax Highlighting? ~

If you have a slow computer, you may wish to reduce the values for >
	:syn sync maxlines=200
	:syn sync minlines=50
(especially the latter).  If your computer is fast, you may wish to
increase them.	This primarily affects synchronizing (i.e. just what group,
if any, is the text at the top of the screen supposed to be in?).

Another cause of slow highlighting is due to syntax-driven folding; see
|tex-folding| for a way around this.

					*g:tex_fast*

Finally, if syntax highlighting is still too slow, you may set >

	:let g:tex_fast= ""

in your vimrc.  Used this way, the g:tex_fast variable causes the syntax
highlighting script to avoid defining any regions and associated
synchronization.  The result will be much faster syntax highlighting; the
price: you will no longer have as much highlighting or any syntax-based
folding, and you will be missing syntax-based error checking.

You may decide that some syntax is acceptable; you may use the following table
selectively to enable just some syntax highlighting: >

    b : allow bold and italic syntax
    c : allow texComment syntax
    m : allow texMatcher syntax (ie. {...} and [...])
    M : allow texMath syntax
    p : allow parts, chapter, section, etc syntax
    r : allow texRefZone syntax (nocite, bibliography, label, pageref, eqref)
    s : allow superscript/subscript regions
    S : allow texStyle syntax
    v : allow verbatim syntax
    V : allow texNewEnv and texNewCmd syntax
<
As an example, let g:tex_fast= "M" will allow math-associated highlighting
but suppress all the other region-based syntax highlighting.
(also see: |g:tex_conceal| and |tex-supersub|)

					*tex-morecommands* *tex-package*
 Tex: Want To Highlight More Commands? ~

LaTeX is a programmable language, and so there are thousands of packages full
of specialized LaTeX commands, syntax, and fonts.  If you're using such a
package you'll often wish that the distributed syntax/tex.vim would support
it.  However, clearly this is impractical.  So please consider using the
techniques in |mysyntaxfile-add| to extend or modify the highlighting provided
by syntax/tex.vim.  Please consider uploading any extensions that you write,
which typically would go in $HOME/after/syntax/tex/[pkgname].vim, to
http://vim.sf.net/.

					*tex-error* *g:tex_no_error*
 Tex: Excessive Error Highlighting? ~

The <tex.vim> supports lexical error checking of various sorts.  Thus,
although the error checking is ofttimes very useful, it can indicate
errors where none actually are.  If this proves to be a problem for you,
you may put in your vimrc the following statement: >
	let g:tex_no_error=1
and all error checking by <syntax/tex.vim> will be suppressed.

								*tex-math*
 Tex: Need a new Math Group? ~

If you want to include a new math group in your LaTeX, the following
code shows you an example as to how you might do so: >
	call TexNewMathZone(sfx,mathzone,starform)
You'll want to provide the new math group with a unique suffix
(currently, A-L and V-Z are taken by <syntax/tex.vim> itself).
As an example, consider how eqnarray is set up by <syntax/tex.vim>: >
	call TexNewMathZone("D","eqnarray",1)
You'll need to change "mathzone" to the name of your new math group,
and then to the call to it in .vim/after/syntax/tex.vim.
The "starform" variable, if true, implies that your new math group
has a starred form (ie. eqnarray*).

					*tex-style* *b:tex_stylish*
 Tex: Starting a New Style? ~

One may use "\makeatletter" in *.tex files, thereby making the use of "@" in
commands available.  However, since the *.tex file doesn't have one of the
following suffices: sty cls clo dtx ltx, the syntax highlighting will flag
such use of @ as an error.  To solve this: >

	:let b:tex_stylish = 1
	:set ft=tex

Putting "let g:tex_stylish=1" into your vimrc will make <syntax/tex.vim>
always accept such use of @.

					*tex-cchar* *tex-cole* *tex-conceal*
 Tex: Taking Advantage of Conceal Mode~

If you have |'conceallevel'| set to 2 and if your encoding is utf-8, then a
number of character sequences can be translated into appropriate utf-8 glyphs,
including various accented characters, Greek characters in MathZones, and
superscripts and subscripts in MathZones.  Not all characters can be made into
superscripts or subscripts; the constraint is due to what utf-8 supports.
In fact, only a few characters are supported as subscripts.

One way to use this is to have vertically split windows (see |CTRL-W_v|); one
with |'conceallevel'| at 0 and the other at 2; and both using |'scrollbind'|.

					*g:tex_conceal*
 Tex: Selective Conceal Mode~

You may selectively use conceal mode by setting g:tex_conceal in your
vimrc.  By default, g:tex_conceal is set to "admgs" to enable concealment
for the following sets of characters: >

	a = accents/ligatures
	b = bold and italic
	d = delimiters
	m = math symbols
	g = Greek
	s = superscripts/subscripts
<
By leaving one or more of these out, the associated conceal-character
substitution will not be made.

						*g:tex_isk* *g:tex_stylish*
 Tex: Controlling iskeyword~

Normally, LaTeX keywords support 0-9, a-z, A-z, and 192-255 only. Latex
keywords don't support the underscore - except when in *.sty files.  The
syntax highlighting script handles this with the following logic:

	* If g:tex_stylish exists and is 1
		then the file will be treated as a "sty" file, so the "_"
		will be allowed as part of keywords
		(irregardless of g:tex_isk)
	* Else if the file's suffix is sty, cls, clo, dtx, or ltx,
		then the file will be treated as a "sty" file, so the "_"
		will be allowed as part of keywords
		(irregardless of g:tex_isk)

	* If g:tex_isk exists, then it will be used for the local 'iskeyword'
	* Else the local 'iskeyword' will be set to 48-57,a-z,A-Z,192-255

			*tex-supersub* *g:tex_superscripts* *g:tex_subscripts*
 Tex: Fine Subscript and Superscript Control~

	See |tex-conceal| for how to enable concealed character replacement.

	See |g:tex_conceal| for selectively concealing accents, bold/italic,
	math, Greek, and superscripts/subscripts.

	One may exert fine control over which superscripts and subscripts one
	wants syntax-based concealment for (see |:syn-cchar|).  Since not all
	fonts support all characters, one may override the
	concealed-replacement lists; by default these lists are given by: >

	    let g:tex_superscripts= "[0-9a-zA-W.,:;+-<>/()=]"
	    let g:tex_subscripts= "[0-9aehijklmnoprstuvx,+-/().]"
<
	For example, I use Luxi Mono Bold; it doesn't support subscript
	characters for "hklmnpst", so I put >
		let g:tex_subscripts= "[0-9aeijoruvx,+-/().]"
<	in ~/.config/nvim/ftplugin/tex/tex.vim in order to avoid having 
	inscrutable utf-8 glyphs appear.


TF						*tf.vim* *ft-tf-syntax*

There is one option for the tf syntax highlighting.

For syncing, minlines defaults to 100.	If you prefer another value, you can
set "tf_minlines" to the value you desire.  Example: >

	:let tf_minlines = your choice
<
VIM			*vim.vim*		*ft-vim-syntax*
			*g:vimsyn_minlines*	*g:vimsyn_maxlines*
There is a trade-off between more accurate syntax highlighting versus screen
updating speed.  To improve accuracy, you may wish to increase the
g:vimsyn_minlines variable.  The g:vimsyn_maxlines variable may be used to
improve screen updating rates (see |:syn-sync| for more on this). >

	g:vimsyn_minlines : used to set synchronization minlines
	g:vimsyn_maxlines : used to set synchronization maxlines
<
	(g:vim_minlines and g:vim_maxlines are deprecated variants of
	these two options)

						*g:vimsyn_embed*
The g:vimsyn_embed option allows users to select what, if any, types of
embedded script highlighting they wish to have. >

   g:vimsyn_embed == 0   : don't embed any scripts
   g:vimsyn_embed =~ 'P' : support embedded python
<
By default, g:vimsyn_embed is a string supporting interpreters that your vim
itself supports.
						*g:vimsyn_folding*

Some folding is now supported with syntax/vim.vim: >

   g:vimsyn_folding == 0 or doesn't exist: no syntax-based folding
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'a' : augroups
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'f' : fold functions
   g:vimsyn_folding =~ 'P' : fold python   script
<
							*g:vimsyn_noerror*
Not all error highlighting that syntax/vim.vim does may be correct; VimL is a
difficult language to highlight correctly.  A way to suppress error
highlighting is to put the following line in your |vimrc|: >

	let g:vimsyn_noerror = 1
<


XF86CONFIG				*xf86conf.vim* *ft-xf86conf-syntax*

The syntax of XF86Config file differs in XFree86 v3.x and v4.x.  Both
variants are supported.  Automatic detection is used, but is far from perfect.
You may need to specify the version manually.  Set the variable
xf86conf_xfree86_version to 3 or 4 according to your XFree86 version in
your vimrc.  Example: >
	:let xf86conf_xfree86_version=3
When using a mix of versions, set the b:xf86conf_xfree86_version variable.

Note that spaces and underscores in option names are not supported.  Use
"SyncOnGreen" instead of "__s yn con gr_e_e_n" if you want the option name
highlighted.


XML						*xml.vim* *ft-xml-syntax*

Xml namespaces are highlighted by default.  This can be inhibited by
setting a global variable: >

	:let g:xml_namespace_transparent=1
<
							*xml-folding*
The xml syntax file provides syntax |folding| (see |:syn-fold|) between
start and end tags.  This can be turned on by >

	:let g:xml_syntax_folding = 1
	:set foldmethod=syntax

Note: syntax folding might slow down syntax highlighting significantly,
especially for large files.


X Pixmaps (XPM)					*xpm.vim* *ft-xpm-syntax*

xpm.vim creates its syntax items dynamically based upon the contents of the
XPM file.  Thus if you make changes e.g. in the color specification strings,
you have to source it again e.g. with ":set syn=xpm".

To copy a pixel with one of the colors, yank a "pixel" with "yl" and insert it
somewhere else with "P".

Do you want to draw with the mouse?  Try the following: >
   :function! GetPixel()
   :   let c = getline(".")[col(".") - 1]
   :   echo c
   :   exe "noremap <LeftMouse> <LeftMouse>r".c
   :   exe "noremap <LeftDrag>	<LeftMouse>r".c
   :endfunction
   :noremap <RightMouse> <LeftMouse>:call GetPixel()<CR>
   :set guicursor=n:hor20	   " to see the color beneath the cursor
This turns the right button into a pipette and the left button into a pen.
It will work with XPM files that have one character per pixel only and you
must not click outside of the pixel strings, but feel free to improve it.

It will look much better with a font in a quadratic cell size, e.g. for X: >
	:set guifont=-*-clean-medium-r-*-*-8-*-*-*-*-80-*


YAML						*yaml.vim* *ft-yaml-syntax*

					*g:yaml_schema* *b:yaml_schema*
A YAML schema is a combination of a set of tags and a mechanism for resolving 
non-specific tags. For user this means that YAML parser may, depending on 
plain scalar contents, treat plain scalar (which can actually be only string 
and nothing else) as a value of the other type: null, boolean, floating-point, 
integer. `g:yaml_schema` option determines according to which schema values 
will be highlighted specially. Supported schemas are

Schema		Description ~
failsafe	No additional highlighting.
json		Supports JSON-style numbers, booleans and null.
core		Supports more number, boolean and null styles.
pyyaml		In addition to core schema supports highlighting timestamps, 
		but there are some differences in what is recognized as 
		numbers and many additional boolean values not present in core 
		schema.

Default schema is `core`.

Note that schemas are not actually limited to plain scalars, but this is the 
only difference between schemas defined in YAML specification and the only 
difference defined in the syntax file.


ZSH						    *zsh.vim* *ft-zsh-syntax*

The syntax script for zsh allows for syntax-based folding: >

	:let g:zsh_fold_enable = 1

==============================================================================
5. Defining a syntax					*:syn-define* *E410*

Vim understands three types of syntax items:

1. Keyword
   It can only contain keyword characters, according to the 'iskeyword'
   option.  It cannot contain other syntax items.  It will only match with a
   complete word (there are no keyword characters before or after the match).
   The keyword "if" would match in "if(a=b)", but not in "ifdef x", because
   "(" is not a keyword character and "d" is.

2. Match
   This is a match with a single regexp pattern.

3. Region
   This starts at a match of the "start" regexp pattern and ends with a match
   with the "end" regexp pattern.  Any other text can appear in between.  A
   "skip" regexp pattern can be used to avoid matching the "end" pattern.

Several syntax ITEMs can be put into one syntax GROUP.	For a syntax group
you can give highlighting attributes.  For example, you could have an item
to define a "/* .. */" comment and another one that defines a "// .." comment,
and put them both in the "Comment" group.  You can then specify that a
"Comment" will be in bold font and have a blue color.  You are free to make
one highlight group for one syntax item, or put all items into one group.
This depends on how you want to specify your highlighting attributes.  Putting
each item in its own group results in having to specify the highlighting
for a lot of groups.

Note that a syntax group and a highlight group are similar.  For a highlight
group you will have given highlight attributes.  These attributes will be used
for the syntax group with the same name.

In case more than one item matches at the same position, the one that was
defined LAST wins.  Thus you can override previously defined syntax items by
using an item that matches the same text.  But a keyword always goes before a
match or region.  And a keyword with matching case always goes before a
keyword with ignoring case.


PRIORITY						*:syn-priority*

When several syntax items may match, these rules are used:

1. When multiple Match or Region items start in the same position, the item
   defined last has priority.
2. A Keyword has priority over Match and Region items.
3. An item that starts in an earlier position has priority over items that
   start in later positions.


DEFINING CASE						*:syn-case* *E390*

:sy[ntax] case [match | ignore]
	This defines if the following ":syntax" commands will work with
	matching case, when using "match", or with ignoring case, when using
	"ignore".  Note that any items before this are not affected, and all
	items until the next ":syntax case" command are affected.


SPELL CHECKING						*:syn-spell*

:sy[ntax] spell [toplevel | notoplevel | default]
	This defines where spell checking is to be done for text that is not
	in a syntax item:

	toplevel:	Text is spell checked.
	notoplevel:	Text is not spell checked.
	default:	When there is a @Spell cluster no spell checking.

	For text in syntax items use the @Spell and @NoSpell clusters
	|spell-syntax|.  When there is no @Spell and no @NoSpell cluster then
	spell checking is done for "default" and "toplevel".

	To activate spell checking the 'spell' option must be set.

SYNTAX ISKEYWORD SETTING				*:syn-iskeyword*

:sy[ntax] iskeyword [clear | {option}]
	This defines the keyword characters.  It's like the 'iskeyword' option
	for but only applies to syntax highlighting.

	clear:		Syntax specific iskeyword setting is disabled and the
			buffer-local 'iskeyword' setting is used.
	{option}        Set the syntax 'iskeyword' option to a new value. 

	Example: >
  :syntax iskeyword @,48-57,192-255,$,_
<
	This would set the syntax specific iskeyword option to include all
	alphabetic characters, plus the numeric characters, all accented
	characters and also includes the "_" and the "$".

	If no argument is given, the current value will be output.

	Setting this option influences what |/\k| matches in syntax patterns
	and also determines where |:syn-keyword| will be checked for a new
	match.

	It is recommended when writing syntax files, to use this command
	to the correct value for the specific syntax language and not change
	the 'iskeyword' option.

DEFINING KEYWORDS					*:syn-keyword*

:sy[ntax] keyword {group-name} [{options}] {keyword} .. [{options}]

	This defines a number of keywords.

	{group-name}	Is a syntax group name such as "Comment".
	[{options}]	See |:syn-arguments| below.
	{keyword} ..	Is a list of keywords which are part of this group.

	Example: >
  :syntax keyword   Type   int long char
<
	The {options} can be given anywhere in the line.  They will apply to
	all keywords given, also for options that come after a keyword.
	These examples do exactly the same: >
  :syntax keyword   Type   contained int long char
  :syntax keyword   Type   int long contained char
  :syntax keyword   Type   int long char contained
<								*E789* *E890*
	When you have a keyword with an optional tail, like Ex commands in
	Vim, you can put the optional characters inside [], to define all the
	variations at once: >
  :syntax keyword   vimCommand	 ab[breviate] n[ext]
<
	Don't forget that a keyword can only be recognized if all the
	characters are included in the 'iskeyword' option.  If one character
	isn't, the keyword will never be recognized.
	Multi-byte characters can also be used.  These do not have to be in
	'iskeyword'.
	See |:syn-iskeyword| for defining syntax specific iskeyword settings.

	A keyword always has higher priority than a match or region, the
	keyword is used if more than one item matches.	Keywords do not nest
	and a keyword can't contain anything else.

	Note that when you have a keyword that is the same as an option (even
	one that isn't allowed here), you can not use it.  Use a match
	instead.

	The maximum length of a keyword is 80 characters.

	The same keyword can be defined multiple times, when its containment
	differs.  For example, you can define the keyword once not contained
	and use one highlight group, and once contained, and use a different
	highlight group.  Example: >
  :syn keyword vimCommand tag
  :syn keyword vimSetting contained tag
<	When finding "tag" outside of any syntax item, the "vimCommand"
	highlight group is used.  When finding "tag" in a syntax item that
	contains "vimSetting", the "vimSetting" group is used.


DEFINING MATCHES					*:syn-match*

:sy[ntax] match {group-name} [{options}] [excludenl] {pattern} [{options}]

	This defines one match.

	{group-name}		A syntax group name such as "Comment".
	[{options}]		See |:syn-arguments| below.
	[excludenl]		Don't make a pattern with the end-of-line "$"
				extend a containing match or region.  Must be
				given before the pattern. |:syn-excludenl|
	{pattern}		The search pattern that defines the match.
				See |:syn-pattern| below.
				Note that the pattern may match more than one
				line, which makes the match depend on where
				Vim starts searching for the pattern.  You
				need to make sure syncing takes care of this.

	Example (match a character constant): >
  :syntax match Character /'.'/hs=s+1,he=e-1
<

DEFINING REGIONS	*:syn-region* *:syn-start* *:syn-skip* *:syn-end*
							*E398* *E399*
:sy[ntax] region {group-name} [{options}]
		[matchgroup={group-name}]
		[keepend]
		[extend]
		[excludenl]
		start={start_pattern} ..
		[skip={skip_pattern}]
		end={end_pattern} ..
		[{options}]

	This defines one region.  It may span several lines.

	{group-name}		A syntax group name such as "Comment".
	[{options}]		See |:syn-arguments| below.
	[matchgroup={group-name}]  The syntax group to use for the following
				start or end pattern matches only.  Not used
				for the text in between the matched start and
				end patterns.  Use NONE to reset to not using
				a different group for the start or end match.
				See |:syn-matchgroup|.
	keepend			Don't allow contained matches to go past a
				match with the end pattern.  See
				|:syn-keepend|.
	extend			Override a "keepend" for an item this region
				is contained in.  See |:syn-extend|.
	excludenl		Don't make a pattern with the end-of-line "$"
				extend a containing match or item.  Only
				useful for end patterns.  Must be given before
				the patterns it applies to. |:syn-excludenl|
	start={start_pattern}	The search pattern that defines the start of
				the region.  See |:syn-pattern| below.
	skip={skip_pattern}	The search pattern that defines text inside
				the region where not to look for the end
				pattern.  See |:syn-pattern| below.
	end={end_pattern}	The search pattern that defines the end of
				the region.  See |:syn-pattern| below.

	Example: >
  :syntax region String   start=+"+  skip=+\\"+  end=+"+
<
	The start/skip/end patterns and the options can be given in any order.
	There can be zero or one skip pattern.	There must be one or more
	start and end patterns.  This means that you can omit the skip
	pattern, but you must give at least one start and one end pattern.  It
	is allowed to have white space before and after the equal sign
	(although it mostly looks better without white space).

	When more than one start pattern is given, a match with one of these
	is sufficient.	This means there is an OR relation between the start
	patterns.  The last one that matches is used.  The same is true for
	the end patterns.

	The search for the end pattern starts right after the start pattern.
	Offsets are not used for this.	This implies that the match for the
	end pattern will never overlap with the start pattern.

	The skip and end pattern can match across line breaks, but since the
	search for the pattern can start in any line it often does not do what
	you want.  The skip pattern doesn't avoid a match of an end pattern in
	the next line.	Use single-line patterns to avoid trouble.

	Note: The decision to start a region is only based on a matching start
	pattern.  There is no check for a matching end pattern.  This does NOT
	work: >
		:syn region First  start="("  end=":"
		:syn region Second start="("  end=";"
<	The Second always matches before the First (last defined pattern has
	higher priority).  The Second region then continues until the next
	';', no matter if there is a ':' before it.  Using a match does work: >
		:syn match First  "(\_.\{-}:"
		:syn match Second "(\_.\{-};"
<	This pattern matches any character or line break with "\_." and
	repeats that with "\{-}" (repeat as few as possible).

							*:syn-keepend*
	By default, a contained match can obscure a match for the end pattern.
	This is useful for nesting.  For example, a region that starts with
	"{" and ends with "}", can contain another region.  An encountered "}"
	will then end the contained region, but not the outer region:
	    {		starts outer "{}" region
		{	starts contained "{}" region
		}	ends contained "{}" region
	    }		ends outer "{} region
	If you don't want this, the "keepend" argument will make the matching
	of an end pattern of the outer region also end any contained item.
	This makes it impossible to nest the same region, but allows for
	contained items to highlight parts of the end pattern, without causing
	that to skip the match with the end pattern.  Example: >
  :syn match  vimComment +"[^"]\+$+
  :syn region vimCommand start="set" end="$" contains=vimComment keepend
<	The "keepend" makes the vimCommand always end at the end of the line,
	even though the contained vimComment includes a match with the <EOL>.

	When "keepend" is not used, a match with an end pattern is retried
	after each contained match.  When "keepend" is included, the first
	encountered match with an end pattern is used, truncating any
	contained matches.
							*:syn-extend*
	The "keepend" behavior can be changed by using the "extend" argument.
	When an item with "extend" is contained in an item that uses
	"keepend", the "keepend" is ignored and the containing region will be
	extended.
	This can be used to have some contained items extend a region while
	others don't.  Example: >

   :syn region htmlRef start=+<a>+ end=+</a>+ keepend contains=htmlItem,htmlScript
   :syn match htmlItem +<[^>]*>+ contained
   :syn region htmlScript start=+<script+ end=+</script[^>]*>+ contained extend

<	Here the htmlItem item does not make the htmlRef item continue
	further, it is only used to highlight the <> items.  The htmlScript
	item does extend the htmlRef item.

	Another example: >
   :syn region xmlFold start="<a>" end="</a>" fold transparent keepend extend
<	This defines a region with "keepend", so that its end cannot be
	changed by contained items, like when the "</a>" is matched to
	highlight it differently.  But when the xmlFold region is nested (it
	includes itself), the "extend" applies, so that the "</a>" of a nested
	region only ends that region, and not the one it is contained in.

							*:syn-excludenl*
	When a pattern for a match or end pattern of a region includes a '$'
	to match the end-of-line, it will make a region item that it is
	contained in continue on the next line.  For example, a match with
	"\\$" (backslash at the end of the line) can make a region continue
	that would normally stop at the end of the line.  This is the default
	behavior.  If this is not wanted, there are two ways to avoid it:
	1. Use "keepend" for the containing item.  This will keep all
	   contained matches from extending the match or region.  It can be
	   used when all contained items must not extend the containing item.
	2. Use "excludenl" in the contained item.  This will keep that match
	   from extending the containing match or region.  It can be used if
	   only some contained items must not extend the containing item.
	   "excludenl" must be given before the pattern it applies to.

							*:syn-matchgroup*
	"matchgroup" can be used to highlight the start and/or end pattern
	differently than the body of the region.  Example: >
  :syntax region String matchgroup=Quote start=+"+  skip=+\\"+	end=+"+
<	This will highlight the quotes with the "Quote" group, and the text in
	between with the "String" group.
	The "matchgroup" is used for all start and end patterns that follow,
	until the next "matchgroup".  Use "matchgroup=NONE" to go back to not
	using a matchgroup.

	In a start or end pattern that is highlighted with "matchgroup" the
	contained items of the region are not used.  This can be used to avoid
	that a contained item matches in the start or end pattern match.  When
	using "transparent", this does not apply to a start or end pattern
	match that is highlighted with "matchgroup".

	Here is an example, which highlights three levels of parentheses in
	different colors: >
   :sy region par1 matchgroup=par1 start=/(/ end=/)/ contains=par2
   :sy region par2 matchgroup=par2 start=/(/ end=/)/ contains=par3 contained
   :sy region par3 matchgroup=par3 start=/(/ end=/)/ contains=par1 contained
   :hi par1 ctermfg=red guifg=red
   :hi par2 ctermfg=blue guifg=blue
   :hi par3 ctermfg=darkgreen guifg=darkgreen
<
						*E849*
The maximum number of syntax groups is 19999.

==============================================================================
6. :syntax arguments					*:syn-arguments*

The :syntax commands that define syntax items take a number of arguments.
The common ones are explained here.  The arguments may be given in any order
and may be mixed with patterns.

Not all commands accept all arguments.	This table shows which arguments
can not be used for all commands:
							*E395*
		    contains  oneline	fold  display  extend concealends~
:syntax keyword		 -	 -	 -	 -	 -      -
:syntax match		yes	 -	yes	yes	yes     -
:syntax region		yes	yes	yes	yes	yes    yes

These arguments can be used for all three commands:
	conceal
	cchar
	contained
	containedin
	nextgroup
	transparent
	skipwhite
	skipnl
	skipempty

conceal						*conceal* *:syn-conceal*

When the "conceal" argument is given, the item is marked as concealable.
Whether or not it is actually concealed depends on the value of the
'conceallevel' option.  The 'concealcursor' option is used to decide whether
concealable items in the current line are displayed unconcealed to be able to
edit the line.
Another way to conceal text with with |matchadd()|.

concealends						*:syn-concealends*

When the "concealends" argument is given, the start and end matches of
the region, but not the contents of the region, are marked as concealable.
Whether or not they are actually concealed depends on the setting on the
'conceallevel' option. The ends of a region can only be concealed separately
in this way when they have their own highlighting via "matchgroup"

cchar							*:syn-cchar*
							*E844*
The "cchar" argument defines the character shown in place of the item
when it is concealed (setting "cchar" only makes sense when the conceal
argument is given.) If "cchar" is not set then the default conceal
character defined in the 'listchars' option is used.  The character cannot be
a control character such as Tab.  Example: >
   :syntax match Entity "&amp;" conceal cchar=&
See |hl-Conceal| for highlighting.

contained						*:syn-contained*

When the "contained" argument is given, this item will not be recognized at
the top level, but only when it is mentioned in the "contains" field of
another match.	Example: >
   :syntax keyword Todo    TODO    contained
   :syntax match   Comment "//.*"  contains=Todo


display							*:syn-display*

If the "display" argument is given, this item will be skipped when the
detected highlighting will not be displayed.  This will speed up highlighting,
by skipping this item when only finding the syntax state for the text that is
to be displayed.

Generally, you can use "display" for match and region items that meet these
conditions:
- The item does not continue past the end of a line.  Example for C: A region
  for a "/*" comment can't contain "display", because it continues on the next
  line.
- The item does not contain items that continue past the end of the line or
  make it continue on the next line.
- The item does not change the size of any item it is contained in.  Example
  for C: A match with "\\$" in a preprocessor match can't have "display",
  because it may make that preprocessor match shorter.
- The item does not allow other items to match that didn't match otherwise,
  and that item may extend the match too far.  Example for C: A match for a
  "//" comment can't use "display", because a "/*" inside that comment would
  match then and start a comment which extends past the end of the line.

Examples, for the C language, where "display" can be used:
- match with a number
- match with a label


transparent						*:syn-transparent*

If the "transparent" argument is given, this item will not be highlighted
itself, but will take the highlighting of the item it is contained in.	This
is useful for syntax items that don't need any highlighting but are used
only to skip over a part of the text.

The "contains=" argument is also inherited from the item it is contained in,
unless a "contains" argument is given for the transparent item itself.	To
avoid that unwanted items are contained, use "contains=NONE".  Example, which
highlights words in strings, but makes an exception for "vim": >
	:syn match myString /'[^']*'/ contains=myWord,myVim
	:syn match myWord   /\<[a-z]*\>/ contained
	:syn match myVim    /\<vim\>/ transparent contained contains=NONE
	:hi link myString String
	:hi link myWord   Comment
Since the "myVim" match comes after "myWord" it is the preferred match (last
match in the same position overrules an earlier one).  The "transparent"
argument makes the "myVim" match use the same highlighting as "myString".  But
it does not contain anything.  If the "contains=NONE" argument would be left
out, then "myVim" would use the contains argument from myString and allow
"myWord" to be contained, which will be highlighted as a Constant.  This
happens because a contained match doesn't match inside itself in the same
position, thus the "myVim" match doesn't overrule the "myWord" match here.

When you look at the colored text, it is like looking at layers of contained
items.	The contained item is on top of the item it is contained in, thus you
see the contained item.  When a contained item is transparent, you can look
through, thus you see the item it is contained in.  In a picture:

		look from here

	    |	|   |	|   |	|
	    V	V   V	V   V	V

	       xxxx	  yyy		more contained items
	    ....................	contained item (transparent)
	=============================	first item

The 'x', 'y' and '=' represent a highlighted syntax item.  The '.' represent a
transparent group.

What you see is:

	=======xxxx=======yyy========

Thus you look through the transparent "....".


oneline							*:syn-oneline*

The "oneline" argument indicates that the region does not cross a line
boundary.  It must match completely in the current line.  However, when the
region has a contained item that does cross a line boundary, it continues on
the next line anyway.  A contained item can be used to recognize a line
continuation pattern.  But the "end" pattern must still match in the first
line, otherwise the region doesn't even start.

When the start pattern includes a "\n" to match an end-of-line, the end
pattern must be found in the same line as where the start pattern ends.  The
end pattern may also include an end-of-line.  Thus the "oneline" argument
means that the end of the start pattern and the start of the end pattern must
be within one line.  This can't be changed by a skip pattern that matches a
line break.


fold							*:syn-fold*

The "fold" argument makes the fold level increase by one for this item.
Example: >
   :syn region myFold start="{" end="}" transparent fold
   :syn sync fromstart
   :set foldmethod=syntax
This will make each {} block form one fold.

The fold will start on the line where the item starts, and end where the item
ends.  If the start and end are within the same line, there is no fold.
The 'foldnestmax' option limits the nesting of syntax folds.
{not available when Vim was compiled without |+folding| feature}


			*:syn-contains* *E405* *E406* *E407* *E408* *E409*
contains={group-name},..

The "contains" argument is followed by a list of syntax group names.  These
groups will be allowed to begin inside the item (they may extend past the
containing group's end).  This allows for recursive nesting of matches and
regions.  If there is no "contains" argument, no groups will be contained in
this item.  The group names do not need to be defined before they can be used
here.

contains=ALL
		If the only item in the contains list is "ALL", then all
		groups will be accepted inside the item.

contains=ALLBUT,{group-name},..
		If the first item in the contains list is "ALLBUT", then all
		groups will be accepted inside the item, except the ones that
		are listed.  Example: >
  :syntax region Block start="{" end="}" ... contains=ALLBUT,Function

contains=TOP
		If the first item in the contains list is "TOP", then all
		groups will be accepted that don't have the "contained"
		argument.
contains=TOP,{group-name},..
		Like "TOP", but excluding the groups that are listed.

contains=CONTAINED
		If the first item in the contains list is "CONTAINED", then
		all groups will be accepted that have the "contained"
		argument.
contains=CONTAINED,{group-name},..
		Like "CONTAINED", but excluding the groups that are
		listed.


The {group-name} in the "contains" list can be a pattern.  All group names
that match the pattern will be included (or excluded, if "ALLBUT" is used).
The pattern cannot contain white space or a ','.  Example: >
   ... contains=Comment.*,Keyw[0-3]
The matching will be done at moment the syntax command is executed.  Groups
that are defined later will not be matched.  Also, if the current syntax
command defines a new group, it is not matched.  Be careful: When putting
syntax commands in a file you can't rely on groups NOT being defined, because
the file may have been sourced before, and ":syn clear" doesn't remove the
group names.

The contained groups will also match in the start and end patterns of a
region.  If this is not wanted, the "matchgroup" argument can be used
|:syn-matchgroup|.  The "ms=" and "me=" offsets can be used to change the
region where contained items do match.	Note that this may also limit the
area that is highlighted


containedin={group-name}...				*:syn-containedin*

The "containedin" argument is followed by a list of syntax group names.  The
item will be allowed to begin inside these groups.  This works as if the
containing item has a "contains=" argument that includes this item.

The {group-name}... can be used just like for "contains", as explained above.

This is useful when adding a syntax item afterwards.  An item can be told to
be included inside an already existing item, without changing the definition
of that item.  For example, to highlight a word in a C comment after loading
the C syntax: >
	:syn keyword myword HELP containedin=cComment contained
Note that "contained" is also used, to avoid that the item matches at the top
level.

Matches for "containedin" are added to the other places where the item can
appear.  A "contains" argument may also be added as usual.  Don't forget that
keywords never contain another item, thus adding them to "containedin" won't
work.


nextgroup={group-name},..				*:syn-nextgroup*

The "nextgroup" argument is followed by a list of syntax group names,
separated by commas (just like with "contains", so you can also use patterns).

If the "nextgroup" argument is given, the mentioned syntax groups will be
tried for a match, after the match or region ends.  If none of the groups have
a match, highlighting continues normally.  If there is a match, this group
will be used, even when it is not mentioned in the "contains" field of the
current group.	This is like giving the mentioned group priority over all
other groups.  Example: >
   :syntax match  ccFoobar  "Foo.\{-}Bar"  contains=ccFoo
   :syntax match  ccFoo     "Foo"	    contained nextgroup=ccFiller
   :syntax region ccFiller  start="."  matchgroup=ccBar  end="Bar"  contained

This will highlight "Foo" and "Bar" differently, and only when there is a
"Bar" after "Foo".  In the text line below, "f" shows where ccFoo is used for
highlighting, and "bbb" where ccBar is used. >

   Foo asdfasd Bar asdf Foo asdf Bar asdf
   fff	       bbb	fff	 bbb

Note the use of ".\{-}" to skip as little as possible until the next Bar.
when ".*" would be used, the "asdf" in between "Bar" and "Foo" would be
highlighted according to the "ccFoobar" group, because the ccFooBar match
would include the first "Foo" and the last "Bar" in the line (see |pattern|).


skipwhite						*:syn-skipwhite*
skipnl							*:syn-skipnl*
skipempty						*:syn-skipempty*

These arguments are only used in combination with "nextgroup".	They can be
used to allow the next group to match after skipping some text:
	skipwhite	skip over space and tab characters
	skipnl		skip over the end of a line
	skipempty	skip over empty lines (implies a "skipnl")

When "skipwhite" is present, the white space is only skipped if there is no
next group that matches the white space.

When "skipnl" is present, the match with nextgroup may be found in the next
line.  This only happens when the current item ends at the end of the current
line!  When "skipnl" is not present, the nextgroup will only be found after
the current item in the same line.

When skipping text while looking for a next group, the matches for other
groups are ignored.  Only when no next group matches, other items are tried
for a match again.  This means that matching a next group and skipping white
space and <EOL>s has a higher priority than other items.

Example: >
  :syn match ifstart "\<if.*"	  nextgroup=ifline skipwhite skipempty
  :syn match ifline  "[^ \t].*" nextgroup=ifline skipwhite skipempty contained
  :syn match ifline  "endif"	contained
Note that the "[^ \t].*" match matches all non-white text.  Thus it would also
match "endif".	Therefore the "endif" match is put last, so that it takes
precedence.
Note that this example doesn't work for nested "if"s.  You need to add
"contains" arguments to make that work (omitted for simplicity of the
example).

IMPLICIT CONCEAL					*:syn-conceal-implicit*

:sy[ntax] conceal [on|off]
	This defines if the following ":syntax" commands will define keywords,
	matches or regions with the "conceal" flag set. After ":syn conceal
	on", all subsequent ":syn keyword", ":syn match" or ":syn region"
	defined will have the "conceal" flag set implicitly. ":syn conceal
	off" returns to the normal state where the "conceal" flag must be
	given explicitly.

==============================================================================
7. Syntax patterns				*:syn-pattern* *E401* *E402*

In the syntax commands, a pattern must be surrounded by two identical
characters.  This is like it works for the ":s" command.  The most common to
use is the double quote.  But if the pattern contains a double quote, you can
use another character that is not used in the pattern.	Examples: >
  :syntax region Comment  start="/\*"  end="\*/"
  :syntax region String   start=+"+    end=+"+	 skip=+\\"+

See |pattern| for the explanation of what a pattern is.  Syntax patterns are
always interpreted like the 'magic' option is set, no matter what the actual
value of 'magic' is.  And the patterns are interpreted like the 'l' flag is
not included in 'cpoptions'.  This was done to make syntax files portable and
independent of the 'magic' setting.

Try to avoid patterns that can match an empty string, such as "[a-z]*".
This slows down the highlighting a lot, because it matches everywhere.

						*:syn-pattern-offset*
The pattern can be followed by a character offset.  This can be used to
change the highlighted part, and to change the text area included in the
match or region (which only matters when trying to match other items).	Both
are relative to the matched pattern.  The character offset for a skip
pattern can be used to tell where to continue looking for an end pattern.

The offset takes the form of "{what}={offset}"
The {what} can be one of seven strings:

ms	Match Start	offset for the start of the matched text
me	Match End	offset for the end of the matched text
hs	Highlight Start	offset for where the highlighting starts
he	Highlight End	offset for where the highlighting ends
rs	Region Start	offset for where the body of a region starts
re	Region End	offset for where the body of a region ends
lc	Leading Context	offset past "leading context" of pattern

The {offset} can be:

s	start of the matched pattern
s+{nr}	start of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the right
s-{nr}	start of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the left
e	end of the matched pattern
e+{nr}	end of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the right
e-{nr}	end of the matched pattern plus {nr} chars to the left
{nr}	(for "lc" only): start matching {nr} chars right of the start

Examples: "ms=s+1", "hs=e-2", "lc=3".

Although all offsets are accepted after any pattern, they are not always
meaningful.  This table shows which offsets are actually used:

		    ms	 me   hs   he	rs   re	  lc ~
match item	    yes  yes  yes  yes	-    -	  yes
region item start   yes  -    yes  -	yes  -	  yes
region item skip    -	 yes  -    -	-    -	  yes
region item end     -	 yes  -    yes	-    yes  yes

Offsets can be concatenated, with a ',' in between.  Example: >
  :syn match String  /"[^"]*"/hs=s+1,he=e-1
<
    some "string" text
	  ^^^^^^		highlighted

Notes:
- There must be no white space between the pattern and the character
  offset(s).
- The highlighted area will never be outside of the matched text.
- A negative offset for an end pattern may not always work, because the end
  pattern may be detected when the highlighting should already have stopped.
- Before Vim 7.2 the offsets were counted in bytes instead of characters.
  This didn't work well for multi-byte characters, so it was changed with the
  Vim 7.2 release.
- The start of a match cannot be in a line other than where the pattern
  matched.  This doesn't work: "a\nb"ms=e.  You can make the highlighting
  start in another line, this does work: "a\nb"hs=e.

Example (match a comment but don't highlight the /* and */): >
  :syntax region Comment start="/\*"hs=e+1 end="\*/"he=s-1
<
	/* this is a comment */
	  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^	  highlighted

A more complicated Example: >
  :syn region Exa matchgroup=Foo start="foo"hs=s+2,rs=e+2 matchgroup=Bar end="bar"me=e-1,he=e-1,re=s-1
<
	 abcfoostringbarabc
	    mmmmmmmmmmm	    match
	      sssrrreee	    highlight start/region/end ("Foo", "Exa" and "Bar")

Leading context			*:syn-lc* *:syn-leading* *:syn-context*

Note: This is an obsolete feature, only included for backwards compatibility
with previous Vim versions.  It's now recommended to use the |/\@<=| construct
in the pattern.

The "lc" offset specifies leading context -- a part of the pattern that must
be present, but is not considered part of the match.  An offset of "lc=n" will
cause Vim to step back n columns before attempting the pattern match, allowing
characters which have already been matched in previous patterns to also be
used as leading context for this match.  This can be used, for instance, to
specify that an "escaping" character must not precede the match: >

  :syn match ZNoBackslash "[^\\]z"ms=s+1
  :syn match WNoBackslash "[^\\]w"lc=1
  :syn match Underline "_\+"
<
	  ___zzzz ___wwww
	  ^^^	  ^^^	  matches Underline
	      ^ ^	  matches ZNoBackslash
		     ^^^^ matches WNoBackslash

The "ms" offset is automatically set to the same value as the "lc" offset,
unless you set "ms" explicitly.


Multi-line patterns					*:syn-multi-line*

The patterns can include "\n" to match an end-of-line.	Mostly this works as
expected, but there are a few exceptions.

When using a start pattern with an offset, the start of the match is not
allowed to start in a following line.  The highlighting can start in a
following line though.  Using the "\zs" item also requires that the start of
the match doesn't move to another line.

The skip pattern can include the "\n", but the search for an end pattern will
continue in the first character of the next line, also when that character is
matched by the skip pattern.  This is because redrawing may start in any line
halfway in a region and there is no check if the skip pattern started in a
previous line. For example, if the skip pattern is "a\nb" and an end pattern
is "b", the end pattern does match in the second line of this: >
	 x x a
	 b x x
Generally this means that the skip pattern should not match any characters
after the "\n".


External matches					*:syn-ext-match*

These extra regular expression items are available in region patterns:

					*/\z(* */\z(\)* *E50* *E52* *E879*
    \z(\)	Marks the sub-expression as "external", meaning that it can be
		accessed from another pattern match.  Currently only usable in
		defining a syntax region start pattern.

					*/\z1* */\z2* */\z3* */\z4* */\z5*
    \z1  ...  \z9			*/\z6* */\z7* */\z8* */\z9* *E66* *E67*
		Matches the same string that was matched by the corresponding
		sub-expression in a previous start pattern match.

Sometimes the start and end patterns of a region need to share a common
sub-expression.  A common example is the "here" document in Perl and many Unix
shells.  This effect can be achieved with the "\z" special regular expression
items, which marks a sub-expression as "external", in the sense that it can be
referenced from outside the pattern in which it is defined.  The here-document
example, for instance, can be done like this: >
  :syn region hereDoc start="<<\z(\I\i*\)" end="^\z1$"

As can be seen here, the \z actually does double duty.	In the start pattern,
it marks the "\(\I\i*\)" sub-expression as external; in the end pattern, it
changes the \z1 back-reference into an external reference referring to the
first external sub-expression in the start pattern.  External references can
also be used in skip patterns: >
  :syn region foo start="start \(\I\i*\)" skip="not end \z1" end="end \z1"

Note that normal and external sub-expressions are completely orthogonal and
indexed separately; for instance, if the pattern "\z(..\)\(..\)" is applied
to the string "aabb", then \1 will refer to "bb" and \z1 will refer to "aa".
Note also that external sub-expressions cannot be accessed as back-references
within the same pattern like normal sub-expressions.  If you want to use one
sub-expression as both a normal and an external sub-expression, you can nest
the two, as in "\(\z(...\)\)".

Note that only matches within a single line can be used.  Multi-line matches
cannot be referred to.

==============================================================================
8. Syntax clusters					*:syn-cluster* *E400*

:sy[ntax] cluster {cluster-name} [contains={group-name}..]
				 [add={group-name}..]
				 [remove={group-name}..]

This command allows you to cluster a list of syntax groups together under a
single name.

	contains={group-name}..
		The cluster is set to the specified list of groups.
	add={group-name}..
		The specified groups are added to the cluster.
	remove={group-name}..
		The specified groups are removed from the cluster.

A cluster so defined may be referred to in a contains=.., containedin=..,
nextgroup=.., add=..  or remove=.. list with a "@" prefix.  You can also use
this notation to implicitly declare a cluster before specifying its contents.

Example: >
   :syntax match Thing "# [^#]\+ #" contains=@ThingMembers
   :syntax cluster ThingMembers contains=ThingMember1,ThingMember2

As the previous example suggests, modifications to a cluster are effectively
retroactive; the membership of the cluster is checked at the last minute, so
to speak: >
   :syntax keyword A aaa
   :syntax keyword B bbb
   :syntax cluster AandB contains=A
   :syntax match Stuff "( aaa bbb )" contains=@AandB
   :syntax cluster AandB add=B	  " now both keywords are matched in Stuff

This also has implications for nested clusters: >
   :syntax keyword A aaa
   :syntax keyword B bbb
   :syntax cluster SmallGroup contains=B
   :syntax cluster BigGroup contains=A,@SmallGroup
   :syntax match Stuff "( aaa bbb )" contains=@BigGroup
   :syntax cluster BigGroup remove=B	" no effect, since B isn't in BigGroup
   :syntax cluster SmallGroup remove=B	" now bbb isn't matched within Stuff
<
						*E848*
The maximum number of clusters is 9767.

==============================================================================
9. Including syntax files				*:syn-include* *E397*

It is often useful for one language's syntax file to include a syntax file for
a related language.  Depending on the exact relationship, this can be done in
two different ways:

	- If top-level syntax items in the included syntax file are to be
	  allowed at the top level in the including syntax, you can simply use
	  the |:runtime| command: >

  " In cpp.vim:
  :runtime! syntax/c.vim
  :unlet b:current_syntax

<	- If top-level syntax items in the included syntax file are to be
	  contained within a region in the including syntax, you can use the
	  ":syntax include" command:

:sy[ntax] include [@{grouplist-name}] {file-name}

	  All syntax items declared in the included file will have the
	  "contained" flag added.  In addition, if a group list is specified,
	  all top-level syntax items in the included file will be added to
	  that list. >

   " In perl.vim:
   :syntax include @Pod <sfile>:p:h/pod.vim
   :syntax region perlPOD start="^=head" end="^=cut" contains=@Pod
<
	  When {file-name} is an absolute path (starts with "/", "c:", "$VAR"
	  or "<sfile>") that file is sourced.  When it is a relative path
	  (e.g., "syntax/pod.vim") the file is searched for in 'runtimepath'.
	  All matching files are loaded.  Using a relative path is
	  recommended, because it allows a user to replace the included file
	  with his own version, without replacing the file that does the ":syn
	  include".

						*E847*
The maximum number of includes is 999.

==============================================================================
10. Synchronizing				*:syn-sync* *E403* *E404*

Vim wants to be able to start redrawing in any position in the document.  To
make this possible it needs to know the syntax state at the position where
redrawing starts.

:sy[ntax] sync [ccomment [group-name] | minlines={N} | ...]

There are four ways to synchronize:
1. Always parse from the start of the file.
   |:syn-sync-first|
2. Based on C-style comments.  Vim understands how C-comments work and can
   figure out if the current line starts inside or outside a comment.
   |:syn-sync-second|
3. Jumping back a certain number of lines and start parsing there.
   |:syn-sync-third|
4. Searching backwards in the text for a pattern to sync on.
   |:syn-sync-fourth|

				*:syn-sync-maxlines* *:syn-sync-minlines*
For the last three methods, the line range where the parsing can start is
limited by "minlines" and "maxlines".

If the "minlines={N}" argument is given, the parsing always starts at least
that many lines backwards.  This can be used if the parsing may take a few
lines before it's correct, or when it's not possible to use syncing.

If the "maxlines={N}" argument is given, the number of lines that are searched
for a comment or syncing pattern is restricted to N lines backwards (after
adding "minlines").  This is useful if you have few things to sync on and a
slow machine.  Example: >
   :syntax sync maxlines=500 ccomment
<
						*:syn-sync-linebreaks*
When using a pattern that matches multiple lines, a change in one line may
cause a pattern to no longer match in a previous line.	This means has to
start above where the change was made.	How many lines can be specified with
the "linebreaks" argument.  For example, when a pattern may include one line
break use this: >
   :syntax sync linebreaks=1
The result is that redrawing always starts at least one line before where a
change was made.  The default value for "linebreaks" is zero.  Usually the
value for "minlines" is bigger than "linebreaks".


First syncing method:			*:syn-sync-first*
>
   :syntax sync fromstart

The file will be parsed from the start.  This makes syntax highlighting
accurate, but can be slow for long files.  Vim caches previously parsed text,
so that it's only slow when parsing the text for the first time.  However,
when making changes some part of the text needs to be parsed again (worst
case: to the end of the file).

Using "fromstart" is equivalent to using "minlines" with a very large number.


Second syncing method:			*:syn-sync-second* *:syn-sync-ccomment*

For the second method, only the "ccomment" argument needs to be given.
Example: >
   :syntax sync ccomment

When Vim finds that the line where displaying starts is inside a C-style
comment, the last region syntax item with the group-name "Comment" will be
used.  This requires that there is a region with the group-name "Comment"!
An alternate group name can be specified, for example: >
   :syntax sync ccomment javaComment
This means that the last item specified with "syn region javaComment" will be
used for the detected C comment region.  This only works properly if that
region does have a start pattern "\/*" and an end pattern "*\/".

The "maxlines" argument can be used to restrict the search to a number of
lines.	The "minlines" argument can be used to at least start a number of
lines back (e.g., for when there is some construct that only takes a few
lines, but it hard to sync on).

Note: Syncing on a C comment doesn't work properly when strings are used
that cross a line and contain a "*/".  Since letting strings cross a line
is a bad programming habit (many compilers give a warning message), and the
chance of a "*/" appearing inside a comment is very small, this restriction
is hardly ever noticed.


Third syncing method:				*:syn-sync-third*

For the third method, only the "minlines={N}" argument needs to be given.
Vim will subtract {N} from the line number and start parsing there.  This
means {N} extra lines need to be parsed, which makes this method a bit slower.
Example: >
   :syntax sync minlines=50

"lines" is equivalent to "minlines" (used by older versions).


Fourth syncing method:				*:syn-sync-fourth*

The idea is to synchronize on the end of a few specific regions, called a
sync pattern.  Only regions can cross lines, so when we find the end of some
region, we might be able to know in which syntax item we are.  The search
starts in the line just above the one where redrawing starts.  From there
the search continues backwards in the file.

This works just like the non-syncing syntax items.  You can use contained
matches, nextgroup, etc.  But there are a few differences:
- Keywords cannot be used.
- The syntax items with the "sync" keyword form a completely separated group
  of syntax items.  You can't mix syncing groups and non-syncing groups.
- The matching works backwards in the buffer (line by line), instead of
  forwards.
- A line continuation pattern can be given.  It is used to decide which group
  of lines need to be searched like they were one line.  This means that the
  search for a match with the specified items starts in the first of the
  consecutive that contain the continuation pattern.
- When using "nextgroup" or "contains", this only works within one line (or
  group of continued lines).
- When using a region, it must start and end in the same line (or group of
  continued lines).  Otherwise the end is assumed to be at the end of the
  line (or group of continued lines).
- When a match with a sync pattern is found, the rest of the line (or group of
  continued lines) is searched for another match.  The last match is used.
  This is used when a line can contain both the start end the end of a region
  (e.g., in a C-comment like /* this */, the last "*/" is used).

There are two ways how a match with a sync pattern can be used:
1. Parsing for highlighting starts where redrawing starts (and where the
   search for the sync pattern started).  The syntax group that is expected
   to be valid there must be specified.  This works well when the regions
   that cross lines cannot contain other regions.
2. Parsing for highlighting continues just after the match.  The syntax group
   that is expected to be present just after the match must be specified.
   This can be used when the previous method doesn't work well.  It's much
   slower, because more text needs to be parsed.
Both types of sync patterns can be used at the same time.

Besides the sync patterns, other matches and regions can be specified, to
avoid finding unwanted matches.

[The reason that the sync patterns are given separately, is that mostly the
search for the sync point can be much simpler than figuring out the
highlighting.  The reduced number of patterns means it will go (much)
faster.]

					    *syn-sync-grouphere* *E393* *E394*
    :syntax sync match {sync-group-name} grouphere {group-name} "pattern" ..

	Define a match that is used for syncing.  {group-name} is the
	name of a syntax group that follows just after the match.  Parsing
	of the text for highlighting starts just after the match.  A region
	must exist for this {group-name}.  The first one defined will be used.
	"NONE" can be used for when there is no syntax group after the match.

						*syn-sync-groupthere*
    :syntax sync match {sync-group-name} groupthere {group-name} "pattern" ..

	Like "grouphere", but {group-name} is the name of a syntax group that
	is to be used at the start of the line where searching for the sync
	point started.	The text between the match and the start of the sync
	pattern searching is assumed not to change the syntax highlighting.
	For example, in C you could search backwards for "/*" and "*/".  If
	"/*" is found first, you know that you are inside a comment, so the
	"groupthere" is "cComment".  If "*/" is found first, you know that you
	are not in a comment, so the "groupthere" is "NONE".  (in practice
	it's a bit more complicated, because the "/*" and "*/" could appear
	inside a string.  That's left as an exercise to the reader...).

    :syntax sync match ..
    :syntax sync region ..

	Without a "groupthere" argument.  Define a region or match that is
	skipped while searching for a sync point.

						*syn-sync-linecont*
    :syntax sync linecont {pattern}

	When {pattern} matches in a line, it is considered to continue in
	the next line.	This means that the search for a sync point will
	consider the lines to be concatenated.

If the "maxlines={N}" argument is given too, the number of lines that are
searched for a match is restricted to N.  This is useful if you have very
few things to sync on and a slow machine.  Example: >
   :syntax sync maxlines=100

You can clear all sync settings with: >
   :syntax sync clear

You can clear specific sync patterns with: >
   :syntax sync clear {sync-group-name} ..

==============================================================================
11. Listing syntax items		*:syntax* *:sy* *:syn* *:syn-list*

This command lists all the syntax items: >

    :sy[ntax] [list]

To show the syntax items for one syntax group: >

    :sy[ntax] list {group-name}

To list the syntax groups in one cluster:			*E392*	 >

    :sy[ntax] list @{cluster-name}

See above for other arguments for the ":syntax" command.

Note that the ":syntax" command can be abbreviated to ":sy", although ":syn"
is mostly used, because it looks better.

==============================================================================
12. Highlight command			*:highlight* *:hi* *E28* *E411* *E415*

There are three types of highlight groups:
- The ones used for specific languages.  For these the name starts with the
  name of the language.  Many of these don't have any attributes, but are
  linked to a group of the second type.
- The ones used for all syntax languages.
- The ones used for the 'highlight' option.
							*hitest.vim*
You can see all the groups currently active with this command: >
    :so $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/hitest.vim
This will open a new window containing all highlight group names, displayed
in their own color.

						*:colo* *:colorscheme* *E185*
:colo[rscheme]		Output the name of the currently active color scheme.
			This is basically the same as >
				:echo g:colors_name
<			In case g:colors_name has not been defined :colo will
			output "default".  When compiled without the |+eval|
			feature it will output "unknown".

:colo[rscheme] {name}	Load color scheme {name}.  This searches 'runtimepath'
			for the file "colors/{name}.vim".  The first one that
			is found is loaded.
			Also searches all plugins in 'packpath', first below
			"start" and then under "opt".

			Doesn't work recursively, thus you can't use
			":colorscheme" in a color scheme script.
			After the color scheme has been loaded the
			|ColorScheme| autocommand event is triggered.
			For info about writing a colorscheme file: >
				:edit $VIMRUNTIME/colors/README.txt

:hi[ghlight]		List all the current highlight groups that have
			attributes set.

:hi[ghlight] {group-name}
			List one highlight group.

:hi[ghlight] clear	Reset all highlighting to the defaults.  Removes all
			highlighting for groups added by the user!
			Uses the current value of 'background' to decide which
			default colors to use.

:hi[ghlight] clear {group-name}
:hi[ghlight] {group-name} NONE
			Disable the highlighting for one highlight group.  It
			is _not_ set back to the default colors.

:hi[ghlight] [default] {group-name} {key}={arg} ..
			Add a highlight group, or change the highlighting for
			an existing group.
			See |highlight-args| for the {key}={arg} arguments.
			See |:highlight-default| for the optional [default]
			argument.

Normally a highlight group is added once when starting up.  This sets the
default values for the highlighting.  After that, you can use additional
highlight commands to change the arguments that you want to set to non-default
values.  The value "NONE" can be used to switch the value off or go back to
the default value.

A simple way to change colors is with the |:colorscheme| command.  This loads
a file with ":highlight" commands such as this: >

   :hi Comment	gui=bold

Note that all settings that are not included remain the same, only the
specified field is used, and settings are merged with previous ones.  So, the
result is like this single command has been used: >
   :hi Comment	term=bold ctermfg=Cyan guifg=#80a0ff gui=bold
<
							*:highlight-verbose*
When listing a highlight group and 'verbose' is non-zero, the listing will
also tell where it was last set.  Example: >
	:verbose hi Comment
<	Comment        xxx term=bold ctermfg=4 guifg=Blue ~
	   Last set from /home/mool/vim/vim7/runtime/syntax/syncolor.vim ~

When ":hi clear" is used then the script where this command is used will be
mentioned for the default values. See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

					*highlight-args* *E416* *E417* *E423*
There are three types of terminals for highlighting:
term	a normal terminal (vt100, xterm)
cterm	a color terminal (Windows console, color-xterm, these have the "Co"
	termcap entry)
gui	the GUI

For each type the highlighting can be given.  This makes it possible to use
the same syntax file on all terminals, and use the optimal highlighting.

1. highlight arguments for normal terminals

					*bold* *underline* *undercurl*
					*inverse* *italic* *standout*
term={attr-list}			*attr-list* *highlight-term* *E418*
	attr-list is a comma separated list (without spaces) of the
	following items (in any order):
		bold
		underline
		undercurl	a curly underline
		reverse
		inverse		same as reverse
		italic
		standout
		NONE		no attributes used (used to reset it)

	Note that "bold" can be used here and by using a bold font.  They
	have the same effect.
	If running in a terminal, "undercurl" acts as an alias for "underline".
	It is set using |highlight-guisp|.

start={term-list}				*highlight-start* *E422*
stop={term-list}				*term-list* *highlight-stop*
	These lists of terminal codes can be used to get
	non-standard attributes on a terminal.

	The escape sequence specified with the "start" argument
	is written before the characters in the highlighted
	area.  It can be anything that you want to send to the
	terminal to highlight this area.  The escape sequence
	specified with the "stop" argument is written after the
	highlighted area.  This should undo the "start" argument.
	Otherwise the screen will look messed up.

	The {term-list} can have two forms:

	1. A string with escape sequences.
	   This is any string of characters, except that it can't start with
	   "t_" and blanks are not allowed.  The <> notation is recognized
	   here, so you can use things like "<Esc>" and "<Space>".  Example:
		start=<Esc>[27h;<Esc>[<Space>r;

	2. A list of terminal codes.
	   Each terminal code has the form "t_xx", where "xx" is the name of
	   the termcap entry.  The codes have to be separated with commas.
	   White space is not allowed.	Example:
		start=t_C1,t_BL
	   The terminal codes must exist for this to work.


2. highlight arguments for color terminals

cterm={attr-list}					*highlight-cterm*
	See above for the description of {attr-list} |attr-list|.
	The "cterm" argument is likely to be different from "term", when
	colors are used.  For example, in a normal terminal comments could
	be underlined, in a color terminal they can be made Blue.
	Note: Many terminals (e.g., DOS console) can't mix these attributes
	with coloring.	Use only one of "cterm=" OR "ctermfg=" OR "ctermbg=".

ctermfg={color-nr}				*highlight-ctermfg* *E421*
ctermbg={color-nr}				*highlight-ctermbg*
	The {color-nr} argument is a color number.  Its range is zero to
	(not including) the number given by the termcap entry "Co".
	The actual color with this number depends on the type of terminal
	and its settings.  Sometimes the color also depends on the settings of
	"cterm".  For example, on some systems "cterm=bold ctermfg=3" gives
	another color, on others you just get color 3.

	For an xterm this depends on your resources, and is a bit
	unpredictable.	See your xterm documentation for the defaults.	The
	colors for a color-xterm can be changed from the .Xdefaults file.
	Unfortunately this means that it's not possible to get the same colors
	for each user.	See |xterm-color| for info about color xterms.

	The MSDOS standard colors are fixed (in a console window), so these
	have been used for the names.  But the meaning of color names in X11
	are fixed, so these color settings have been used, to make the
	highlighting settings portable (complicated, isn't it?).  The
	following names are recognized, with the color number used:

							*cterm-colors*
	    NR-16   NR-8    COLOR NAME ~
	    0	    0	    Black
	    1	    4	    DarkBlue
	    2	    2	    DarkGreen
	    3	    6	    DarkCyan
	    4	    1	    DarkRed
	    5	    5	    DarkMagenta
	    6	    3	    Brown, DarkYellow
	    7	    7	    LightGray, LightGrey, Gray, Grey
	    8	    0*	    DarkGray, DarkGrey
	    9	    4*	    Blue, LightBlue
	    10	    2*	    Green, LightGreen
	    11	    6*	    Cyan, LightCyan
	    12	    1*	    Red, LightRed
	    13	    5*	    Magenta, LightMagenta
	    14	    3*	    Yellow, LightYellow
	    15	    7*	    White

	The number under "NR-16" is used for 16-color terminals ('t_Co'
	greater than or equal to 16).  The number under "NR-8" is used for
	8-color terminals ('t_Co' less than 16).  The '*' indicates that the
	bold attribute is set for ctermfg.  In many 8-color terminals (e.g.,
	"linux"), this causes the bright colors to appear.  This doesn't work
	for background colors!	Without the '*' the bold attribute is removed.
	If you want to set the bold attribute in a different way, put a
	"cterm=" argument AFTER the "ctermfg=" or "ctermbg=" argument.	Or use
	a number instead of a color name.

	The case of the color names is ignored.
	Note that for 16 color ansi style terminals (including xterms), the
	numbers in the NR-8 column is used.  Here '*' means 'add 8' so that Blue
	is 12, DarkGray is 8 etc.

	Note that for some color terminals these names may result in the wrong
	colors!

	You can also use "NONE" to remove the color.

							*:hi-normal-cterm*
	When setting the "ctermfg" or "ctermbg" colors for the Normal group,
	these will become the colors used for the non-highlighted text.
	Example: >
		:highlight Normal ctermfg=grey ctermbg=darkblue
<	When setting the "ctermbg" color for the Normal group, the
	'background' option will be adjusted automatically.  This causes the
	highlight groups that depend on 'background' to change!  This means
	you should set the colors for Normal first, before setting other
	colors.
	When a colorscheme is being used, changing 'background' causes it to
	be reloaded, which may reset all colors (including Normal).  First
	delete the "g:colors_name" variable when you don't want this.

	When you have set "ctermfg" or "ctermbg" for the Normal group, Vim
	needs to reset the color when exiting.	This is done with the "op"
	termcap entry |t_op|.  If this doesn't work correctly, try setting the
	't_op' option in your vimrc.
							*E419* *E420*
	When Vim knows the normal foreground and background colors, "fg" and
	"bg" can be used as color names.  This only works after setting the
	colors for the Normal group and for the Windows console.  Example, for
	reverse video: >
	    :highlight Visual ctermfg=bg ctermbg=fg
<	Note that the colors are used that are valid at the moment this
	command are given.  If the Normal group colors are changed later, the
	"fg" and "bg" colors will not be adjusted.


3. highlight arguments for the GUI

gui={attr-list}						*highlight-gui*
	These give the attributes to use in the GUI mode.
	See |attr-list| for a description.
	Note that "bold" can be used here and by using a bold font.  They
	have the same effect.
	Note that the attributes are ignored for the "Normal" group.

font={font-name}					*highlight-font*
	font-name is the name of a font, as it is used on the system Vim
	runs on.  For X11 this is a complicated name, for example: >
   font=-misc-fixed-bold-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70-iso8859-1
<
	The font-name "NONE" can be used to revert to the default font.
	When setting the font for the "Normal" group, this becomes the default
	font (until the 'guifont' option is changed; the last one set is
	used).
	The following only works with Motif not with other GUIs:
	When setting the font for the "Menu" group, the menus will be changed.
	When setting the font for the "Tooltip" group, the tooltips will be
	changed.
	All fonts used, except for Menu and Tooltip, should be of the same
	character size as the default font!  Otherwise redrawing problems will
	occur.

guifg={color-name}					*highlight-guifg*
guibg={color-name}					*highlight-guibg*
guisp={color-name}					*highlight-guisp*
	These give the foreground (guifg), background (guibg) and special
	(guisp) color to use in the GUI.  "guisp" is used for undercurl.
	There are a few special names:
		NONE		no color (transparent)
		bg		use normal background color
		background	use normal background color
		fg		use normal foreground color
		foreground	use normal foreground color
	To use a color name with an embedded space or other special character,
	put it in single quotes.  The single quote cannot be used then.
	Example: >
	    :hi comment guifg='salmon pink'
<
							*gui-colors*
	Suggested color names (these are available on most systems):
	    Red		LightRed	DarkRed
	    Green	LightGreen	DarkGreen	SeaGreen
	    Blue	LightBlue	DarkBlue	SlateBlue
	    Cyan	LightCyan	DarkCyan
	    Magenta	LightMagenta	DarkMagenta
	    Yellow	LightYellow	Brown		DarkYellow
	    Gray	LightGray	DarkGray
	    Black	White
	    Orange	Purple		Violet

	In the Win32 GUI version, additional system colors are available.  See
	|win32-colors|.

	You can also specify a color by its Red, Green and Blue values.
	The format is "#rrggbb", where
		"rr"	is the Red value
		"gg"	is the Green value
		"bb"	is the Blue value
	All values are hexadecimal, range from "00" to "ff".  Examples: >
  :highlight Comment guifg=#11f0c3 guibg=#ff00ff
<
					*highlight-groups* *highlight-default*
These are the default highlighting groups.  These groups are used by the
'highlight' option default.  Note that the highlighting depends on the value
of 'background'.  You can see the current settings with the ":highlight"
command.

==============================================================================
13. Linking groups		*:hi-link* *:highlight-link* *E412* *E413*

When you want to use the same highlighting for several syntax groups, you
can do this more easily by linking the groups into one common highlight
group, and give the color attributes only for that group.

To set a link:

    :hi[ghlight][!] [default] link {from-group} {to-group}

To remove a link:

    :hi[ghlight][!] [default] link {from-group} NONE

Notes:							*E414*
- If the {from-group} and/or {to-group} doesn't exist, it is created.  You
  don't get an error message for a non-existing group.
- As soon as you use a ":highlight" command for a linked group, the link is
  removed.
- If there are already highlight settings for the {from-group}, the link is
  not made, unless the '!' is given.  For a ":highlight link" command in a
  sourced file, you don't get an error message.  This can be used to skip
  links for groups that already have settings.

					*:hi-default* *:highlight-default*
The [default] argument is used for setting the default highlighting for a
group.	If highlighting has already been specified for the group the command
will be ignored.  Also when there is an existing link.

Using [default] is especially useful to overrule the highlighting of a
specific syntax file.  For example, the C syntax file contains: >
	:highlight default link cComment Comment
If you like Question highlighting for C comments, put this in your vimrc file: >
	:highlight link cComment Question
Without the "default" in the C syntax file, the highlighting would be
overruled when the syntax file is loaded.

==============================================================================
14. Cleaning up						*:syn-clear* *E391*

If you want to clear the syntax stuff for the current buffer, you can use this
command: >
  :syntax clear

This command should be used when you want to switch off syntax highlighting,
or when you want to switch to using another syntax.  It's normally not needed
in a syntax file itself, because syntax is cleared by the autocommands that
load the syntax file.
The command also deletes the "b:current_syntax" variable, since no syntax is
loaded after this command.

If you want to disable syntax highlighting for all buffers, you need to remove
the autocommands that load the syntax files: >
  :syntax off

What this command actually does, is executing the command >
  :source $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/nosyntax.vim
See the "nosyntax.vim" file for details.  Note that for this to work
$VIMRUNTIME must be valid.  See |$VIMRUNTIME|.

To clean up specific syntax groups for the current buffer: >
  :syntax clear {group-name} ..
This removes all patterns and keywords for {group-name}.

To clean up specific syntax group lists for the current buffer: >
  :syntax clear @{grouplist-name} ..
This sets {grouplist-name}'s contents to an empty list.

						*:syntax-reset* *:syn-reset*
If you have changed the colors and messed them up, use this command to get the
defaults back: >

  :syntax reset

It is a bit of a wrong name, since it does not reset any syntax items, it only
affects the highlighting.

This doesn't change the colors for the 'highlight' option.

Note that the syntax colors that you set in your vimrc file will also be reset
back to their Vim default.
Note that if you are using a color scheme, the colors defined by the color
scheme for syntax highlighting will be lost.

What this actually does is: >

	let g:syntax_cmd = "reset"
	runtime! syntax/syncolor.vim

Note that this uses the 'runtimepath' option.

							*syncolor*
If you want to use different colors for syntax highlighting, you can add a Vim
script file to set these colors.  Put this file in a directory in
'runtimepath' which comes after $VIMRUNTIME, so that your settings overrule
the default colors.  This way these colors will be used after the ":syntax
reset" command.

For Unix you can use the file ~/.config/nvim/after/syntax/syncolor.vim.  
Example: >

	if &background == "light"
	  highlight comment ctermfg=darkgreen guifg=darkgreen
	else
	  highlight comment ctermfg=green guifg=green
	endif

								*E679*
Do make sure this syncolor.vim script does not use a "syntax on", set the
'background' option or uses a "colorscheme" command, because it results in an
endless loop.

Note that when a color scheme is used, there might be some confusion whether
your defined colors are to be used or the colors from the scheme.  This
depends on the color scheme file.  See |:colorscheme|.

							*syntax_cmd*
The "syntax_cmd" variable is set to one of these values when the
syntax/syncolor.vim files are loaded:
   "on"		":syntax on" command.  Highlight colors are overruled but
		links are kept
   "enable"	":syntax enable" command.  Only define colors for groups that
		don't have highlighting yet.  Use ":syntax default".
   "reset"	":syntax reset" command or loading a color scheme.  Define all
		the colors.
   "skip"	Don't define colors.  Used to skip the default settings when a
		syncolor.vim file earlier in 'runtimepath' has already set
		them.

==============================================================================
15. Highlighting tags					*tag-highlight*

If you want to highlight all the tags in your file, you can use the following
mappings.

	<F11>	-- Generate tags.vim file, and highlight tags.
	<F12>	-- Just highlight tags based on existing tags.vim file.
>
  :map <F11>  :sp tags<CR>:%s/^\([^	:]*:\)\=\([^	]*\).*/syntax keyword Tag \2/<CR>:wq! tags.vim<CR>/^<CR><F12>
  :map <F12>  :so tags.vim<CR>

WARNING: The longer the tags file, the slower this will be, and the more
memory Vim will consume.

Only highlighting typedefs, unions and structs can be done too.  For this you
must use Exuberant ctags (found at http://ctags.sf.net).

Put these lines in your Makefile:

# Make a highlight file for types.  Requires Exuberant ctags and awk
types: types.vim
types.vim: *.[ch]
	ctags --c-kinds=gstu -o- *.[ch] |\
		awk 'BEGIN{printf("syntax keyword Type\t")}\
			{printf("%s ", $$1)}END{print ""}' > $@

And put these lines in your vimrc: >

   " load the types.vim highlighting file, if it exists
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch] let fname = expand('<afile>:p:h') . '/types.vim'
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch] if filereadable(fname)
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch]   exe 'so ' . fname
   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.[ch] endif

==============================================================================
16. Window-local syntax				*:ownsyntax*

Normally all windows on a buffer share the same syntax settings. It is
possible, however, to set a particular window on a file to have its own
private syntax setting. A possible example would be to edit LaTeX source
with conventional highlighting in one window, while seeing the same source
highlighted differently (so as to hide control sequences and indicate bold,
italic etc regions) in another. The 'scrollbind' option is useful here.

To set the current window to have the syntax "foo", separately from all other
windows on the buffer: >
   :ownsyntax foo
<						*w:current_syntax*
This will set the "w:current_syntax" variable to "foo".  The value of
"b:current_syntax" does not change.  This is implemented by saving and
restoring "b:current_syntax", since the syntax files do set
"b:current_syntax".  The value set by the syntax file is assigned to
"w:current_syntax".
Note: This resets the 'spell', 'spellcapcheck' and 'spellfile' options.

Once a window has its own syntax, syntax commands executed from other windows
on the same buffer (including :syntax clear) have no effect. Conversely,
syntax commands executed from that window do not affect other windows on the
same buffer.

A window with its own syntax reverts to normal behavior when another buffer
is loaded into that window or the file is reloaded.
When splitting the window, the new window will use the original syntax.

==============================================================================
17. Color xterms				*xterm-color* *color-xterm*

Most color xterms have only eight colors.  If you don't get colors with the
default setup, it should work with these lines in your vimrc: >
   :if &term =~ "xterm"
   :  if has("terminfo")
   :	set t_Co=8
   :	set t_Sf=<Esc>[3%p1%dm
   :	set t_Sb=<Esc>[4%p1%dm
   :  else
   :	set t_Co=8
   :	set t_Sf=<Esc>[3%dm
   :	set t_Sb=<Esc>[4%dm
   :  endif
   :endif
<	[<Esc> is a real escape, type CTRL-V <Esc>]

You might want to change the first "if" to match the name of your terminal,
e.g. "dtterm" instead of "xterm".

Note: Do these settings BEFORE doing ":syntax on".  Otherwise the colors may
be wrong.
							*xiterm* *rxvt*
The above settings have been mentioned to work for xiterm and rxvt too.
But for using 16 colors in an rxvt these should work with terminfo: >
	:set t_AB=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t25;%p1%{40}%+%e5;%p1%{32}%+%;%dm
	:set t_AF=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t22;%p1%{30}%+%e1;%p1%{22}%+%;%dm
<
							*colortest.vim*
To test your color setup, a file has been included in the Vim distribution.
To use it, execute this command: >
   :runtime syntax/colortest.vim

Some versions of xterm (and other terminals, like the Linux console) can
output lighter foreground colors, even though the number of colors is defined
at 8.  Therefore Vim sets the "cterm=bold" attribute for light foreground
colors, when 't_Co' is 8.

							*xfree-xterm*
To get 16 colors or more, get the newest xterm version (which should be
included with XFree86 3.3 and later).  You can also find the latest version
at: >
	http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html
Here is a good way to configure it.  This uses 88 colors and enables the
termcap-query feature, which allows Vim to ask the xterm how many colors it
supports. >
	./configure --disable-bold-color --enable-88-color --enable-tcap-query
If you only get 8 colors, check the xterm compilation settings.
(Also see |UTF8-xterm| for using this xterm with UTF-8 character encoding).

This xterm should work with these lines in your vimrc (for 16 colors): >
   :if has("terminfo")
   :  set t_Co=16
   :  set t_AB=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{40}%+%e%p1%{92}%+%;%dm
   :  set t_AF=<Esc>[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{30}%+%e%p1%{82}%+%;%dm
   :else
   :  set t_Co=16
   :  set t_Sf=<Esc>[3%dm
   :  set t_Sb=<Esc>[4%dm
   :endif
<	[<Esc> is a real escape, type CTRL-V <Esc>]

Without |+terminfo|, Vim will recognize these settings, and automatically
translate cterm colors of 8 and above to "<Esc>[9%dm" and "<Esc>[10%dm".
Colors above 16 are also translated automatically.

For 256 colors this has been reported to work: >

   :set t_AB=<Esc>[48;5;%dm
   :set t_AF=<Esc>[38;5;%dm

Or just set the TERM environment variable to "xterm-color" or "xterm-16color"
and try if that works.

You probably want to use these X resources (in your ~/.Xdefaults file):
	XTerm*color0:			#000000
	XTerm*color1:			#c00000

[Note: The cursorColor is required to work around a bug, which changes the
cursor color to the color of the last drawn text.  This has been fixed by a
newer version of xterm, but not everybody is using it yet.]

To get these right away, reload the .Xdefaults file to the X Option database
Manager (you only need to do this when you just changed the .Xdefaults file): >
  xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults
<
					*xterm-blink* *xterm-blinking-cursor*
To make the cursor blink in an xterm, see tools/blink.c.  Or use Thomas
Dickey's xterm above patchlevel 107 (see above for where to get it), with
these resources:
	XTerm*cursorBlink:	on
	XTerm*cursorOnTime:	400
	XTerm*cursorOffTime:	250
	XTerm*cursorColor:	White

							*hpterm-color*
These settings work (more or less) for an hpterm, which only supports 8
foreground colors: >
   :if has("terminfo")
   :  set t_Co=8
   :  set t_Sf=<Esc>[&v%p1%dS
   :  set t_Sb=<Esc>[&v7S
   :else
   :  set t_Co=8
   :  set t_Sf=<Esc>[&v%dS
   :  set t_Sb=<Esc>[&v7S
   :endif
<	[<Esc> is a real escape, type CTRL-V <Esc>]

						*Eterm* *enlightened-terminal*
These settings have been reported to work for the Enlightened terminal
emulator, or Eterm.  They might work for all xterm-like terminals that use the
bold attribute to get bright colors.  Add an ":if" like above when needed. >
       :set t_Co=16
       :set t_AF=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t3%p1%d%e%p1%{22}%+%d;1%;m
       :set t_AB=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t4%p1%d%e%p1%{32}%+%d;1%;m
<
						*TTpro-telnet*
These settings should work for TTpro telnet.  Tera Term Pro is a freeware /
open-source program for MS-Windows. >
	set t_Co=16
	set t_AB=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{40}%+%e%p1%{32}%+5;%;%dm
	set t_AF=^[[%?%p1%{8}%<%t%p1%{30}%+%e%p1%{22}%+1;%;%dm
Also make sure TTpro's Setup / Window / Full Color is enabled, and make sure
that Setup / Font / Enable Bold is NOT enabled.

18. When syntax is slow						*:syntime*

This is aimed at authors of a syntax file.

If your syntax causes redrawing to be slow, here are a few hints on making it
faster.  To see slowness switch on some features that usually interfere, such
as 'relativenumber' and |folding|.

Note: this is only available when compiled with the |+profile| feature.
You many need to build Vim with "huge" features.

To find out what patterns are consuming most time, get an overview with this
sequence: >
	:syntime on
	[ redraw the text at least once with CTRL-L ]
	:syntime report

This will display a list of syntax patterns that were used, sorted by the time
it took to match them against the text.

:syntime on		Start measuring syntax times.  This will add some
			overhead to compute the time spent on syntax pattern
			matching.

:syntime off		Stop measuring syntax times.

:syntime clear		Set all the counters to zero, restart measuring.

:syntime report		Show the syntax items used since ":syntime on" in the
			current window.  Use a wider display to see more of
			the output.

			The list is sorted by total time. The columns are:
			TOTAL		Total time in seconds spent on
					matching this pattern.
			COUNT		Number of times the pattern was used.
			MATCH		Number of times the pattern actually
					matched
			SLOWEST		The longest time for one try.
			AVERAGE		The average time for one try.
			NAME		Name of the syntax item.  Note that
					this is not unique.
			PATTERN		The pattern being used.

Pattern matching gets slow when it has to try many alternatives.  Try to
include as much literal text as possible to reduce the number of ways a
pattern does NOT match.

When using the "\@<=" and "\@<!" items, add a maximum size to avoid trying at
all positions in the current and previous line.  For example, if the item is
literal text specify the size of that text (in bytes):

"<\@<=span"	Matches "span" in "<span".  This tries matching with "<" in
		many places.
"<\@1<=span"	Matches the same, but only tries one byte before "span".

" Small text columns like the foldcolumn and line number column need a weird
" hack to work around Webkit's and (in versions prior to 9) IE's lack of support
" for the 'ch' unit without messing up Opera, which also doesn't support it but
" works anyway.
"
" The problem is that without the 'ch' unit, it is not possible to specify a
" size of an <input> in terms of character widths. Only Opera seems to do the
" "sensible" thing and make the <input> sized to fit exactly as many characters
" as specified by its "size" attribute, but the spec actually says "at least
" wide enough to fit 'size' characters", so the other browsers are technically
" correct as well.
"
" Anyway, this leads to two diffculties:
"   1. The foldcolumn is made up of multiple elements side-by-side with
"      different sizes, each of which has their own extra padding added. Thus, a
"      column made up of one item of size 1 and another of size 2 would not
"      necessarily be equal in size to another line's foldcolumn with a single
"      item of size 3.
"   2. The extra padding added to the <input> elements adds up to make the
"      foldcolumn and line number column too wide, especially in Webkit
"      browsers.
"
" So, the full workaround is:
"   1. Define a default size in em, equal to the number of characters in the
"      input element, in case javascript is disabled and the browser does not
"      support the 'ch' unit. Unfortunately this makes Opera no longer work
"      properly without javascript. 1em per character is much too wide but it
"      looks better in webkit browsers than unaligned columns.
"   2. Insert the following javascript to run at page load, which checks for the
"      width of a single character (in an extraneous page element inserted
"      before the page title, and set to hidden) and compares it to the width of
"      another extra <input> element with only one character. If the width
"      matches, the script does nothing more, but if not, it will figure out the
"      fraction of an em unit which would correspond with a ch unit if there
"      were one, and set the containing element (<pre> or <div>) to a class with
"      pre-defined rules which is closest to that fraction of an em. Rules are
"      defined from 0.05 em to 1em per ch.
