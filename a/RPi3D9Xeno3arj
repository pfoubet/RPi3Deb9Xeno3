-r returnaddress] [-A] [-ok | -okay | -nok | -nokay]


Options:

  -v    Include Verbose configuration data in the report
  -f    File containing the body of the report. Use this to
        quickly send a prepared message.
  -p    File containing a patch or other text attachment. Separate
        multiple files with commas.
  -F    File to output the resulting mail message to, instead of mailing.
  -S    Send without asking for confirmation.
  -a    Address to send the report to. Defaults to '$address'.
  -c    Address to send copy of report to. Defaults to '$cc'.
  -C    Don't send copy to administrator.
  -s    Subject to include with the message. You will be prompted
        if you don't supply one on the command line.
  -b    Body of the report. If not included on the command line, or
        in a file with -f, you will get a chance to edit the message.
  -r    Your return address. The program will ask you to confirm
        this if you don't give it here.
  -e    Editor to use.
  -t    Test mode. The target address defaults to '$testaddress'.
  -T    Thank-you mode. The target address defaults to '$thanksaddress'.
  -d    Data mode.  This prints out your configuration data, without mailing
        anything. You can use this with -v to get more complete data.
  -A    Don't send a bug received acknowledgement to the return address.
  -ok   Report successful build on this system to perl porters
        (use alone or with -v). Only use -ok if *everything* was ok:
        if there were *any* problems at all, use -nok.
  -okay As -ok but allow report from old builds.
  -nok  Report unsuccessful build on this system to perl porters
        (use alone or with -v). You must describe what went wrong
        in the body of the report which you will be asked to edit.
  -nokay As -nok but allow report from old builds.
  -h    Print this help message.

B<perlthanks>

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This program is designed to help you generate and send bug reports
(and thank-you notes) about perl5 and the modules which ship with it.

In most cases, you can just run it interactively from a command
line without any special arguments and follow the prompts.

If you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one that was not
part of the I<standard distribution>), a binary distribution, or a
non-core module (such as Tk, DBI, etc), then please see the
documentation that came with that distribution to determine the
correct place to report bugs.

If you are unable to send your report using B<perlbug> (most likely
because your system doesn't have a way to send mail that perlbug
recognizes), you may be able to use this tool to compose your report
and save it to a file which you can then send to B<perlbug@perl.org>
using your regular mail client.

In extreme cases, B<perlbug> may not work well enough on your system
to guide you through composing a bug report. In those cases, you
may be able to use B<perlbug -d> to get system configuration
information to include in a manually composed bug report to
B<perlbug@perl.org>.


When reporting a bug, please run through this checklist:

=over 4

=item What version of Perl you are running?

Type C<perl -v> at the command line to find out.

=item Are you running the latest released version of perl?

Look at http://www.perl.org/ to find out.  If you are not using the
latest released version, please try to replicate your bug on the
latest stable release.

Note that reports about bugs in old versions of Perl, especially
those which indicate you haven't also tested the current stable
release of Perl, are likely to receive less attention from the
volunteers who build and maintain Perl than reports about bugs in
the current release.

This tool isn't appropriate for reporting bugs in any version
prior to Perl 5.0.

=item Are you sure what you have is a bug?

A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to be
documented features in Perl.  Make sure the issue you've run into
isn't intentional by glancing through the documentation that comes
with the Perl distribution.

Given the sheer volume of Perl documentation, this isn't a trivial
undertaking, but if you can point to documentation that suggests
the behaviour you're seeing is I<wrong>, your issue is likely to
receive more attention. You may want to start with B<perldoc>
L<perltrap> for pointers to common traps that new (and experienced)
Perl programmers run into.

If you're unsure of the meaning of an error message you've run
across, B<perldoc> L<perldiag> for an explanation.  If the message
isn't in perldiag, it probably isn't generated by Perl.  You may
have luck consulting your operating system documentation instead.

If you are on a non-UNIX platform B<perldoc> L<perlport>, as some
features may be unimplemented or work differently.

You may be able to figure out what's going wrong using the Perl
debugger.  For information about how to use the debugger B<perldoc>
L<perldebug>.

=item Do you have a proper test case?

The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be
fixed -- if nobody can duplicate your problem, it probably won't be 
addressed.

A good test case has most of these attributes: short, simple code;
few dependencies on external commands, modules, or libraries; no
platform-dependent code (unless it's a platform-specific bug);
clear, simple documentation.

A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be included in
Perl's test suite.  If you have the time, consider writing your test case so
that it can be easily included into the standard test suite.

=item Have you included all relevant information?

Be sure to include the B<exact> error messages, if any.
"Perl gave an error" is not an exact error message.

If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a debugger
(B<dbx>, B<gdb>, etc) to produce a stack trace to include in the bug
report.  

NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info
(often B<-g>), the stack trace is likely to be somewhat hard to use
because it will most probably contain only the function names and not
their arguments.  If possible, recompile your Perl with debug info and
reproduce the crash and the stack trace.

=item Can you describe the bug in plain English?

The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely
it will be fixed.  Any insight you can provide into the problem
will help a great deal.  In other words, try to analyze the problem
(to the extent you can) and report your discoveries.

=item Can you fix the bug yourself?

If so, that's great news; bug reports with patches are likely to
receive significantly more attention and interest than those without
patches.  Please attach your patch to the report using the C<-p> option.
When sending a patch, create it using C<git format-patch> if possible,
though a unified diff created with C<diff -pu> will do nearly as well.

Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or requests for more
detailed explanations about your fix.

Here are a few hints for creating high-quality patches:

Make sure the patch is not reversed (the first argument to diff is
typically the original file, the second argument your changed file).
Make sure you test your patch by applying it with C<git am> or the
C<patch> program before you send it on its way.  Try to follow the
same style as the code you are trying to patch.  Make sure your patch
really does work (C<make test>, if the thing you're patching is covered
by Perl's test suite).

=item Can you use C<perlbug> to submit the report?

B<perlbug> will, amongst other things, ensure your report includes
crucial information about your version of perl.  If C<perlbug> is
unable to mail your report after you have typed it in, you may have
to compose the message yourself, add the output produced by C<perlbug
-d> and email it to B<perlbug@perl.org>.  If, for some reason, you
cannot run C<perlbug> at all on your system, be sure to include the
entire output produced by running C<perl -V> (note the uppercase V).

Whether you use C<perlbug> or send the email manually, please make
your Subject line informative.  "a bug" is not informative.  Neither
is "perl crashes" nor is "HELP!!!".  These don't help.  A compact
description of what's wrong is fine.

=item Can you use C<perlbug> to submit a thank-you note?

Yes, you can do this by either using the C<-T> option, or by invoking
the program as C<perlthanks>. Thank-you notes are good. It makes people
smile. 

=back

Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be told the
bug is in your code, or possibly to get no reply at all.  The
volunteers who maintain Perl are busy folks, so if your problem is
an obvious bug in your own code, is difficult to understand or is
a duplicate of an existing report, you may not receive a personal
reply.

If it is important to you that your bug be fixed, do monitor the
perl5-porters@perl.org mailing list (mailing lists are moderated, your
message may take a while to show up) and the commit logs to development
versions of Perl, and encourage the maintainers with kind words or
offers of frosty beverages.  (Please do be kind to the maintainers.
Harassing or flaming them is likely to have the opposite effect of the
one you want.)

Feel free to update the ticket about your bug on http://rt.perl.org
if a new version of Perl is released and your bug is still present.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-a>

Address to send the report to.  Defaults to B<perlbug@perl.org>.

=item B<-A>

Don't send a bug received acknowledgement to the reply address.
Generally it is only a sensible to use this option if you are a
perl maintainer actively watching perl porters for your message to
arrive.

=item B<-b>

Body of the report.  If not included on the command line, or
in a file with B<-f>, you will get a chance to edit the message.

=item B<-C>

Don't send copy to administrator.

=item B<-c>

Address to send copy of report to.  Defaults to the address of the
local perl administrator (recorded when perl was built).

=item B<-d>

Data mode (the default if you redirect or pipe output).  This prints out
your configuration data, without mailing anything.  You can use this
with B<-v> to get more complete data.

=item B<-e>

Editor to use.

=item B<-f>

File containing the body of the report.  Use this to quickly send a
prepared message.

=item B<-F>

File to output the results to instead of sending as an email. Useful
particularly when running perlbug on a machine with no direct internet
connection.

=item B<-h>

Prints a brief summary of the options.

=item B<-ok>

Report successful build on this system to perl porters. Forces B<-S>
and B<-C>. Forces and supplies values for B<-s> and B<-b>. Only
prompts for a return address if it cannot guess it (for use with
B<make>). Honors return address specified with B<-r>.  You can use this
with B<-v> to get more complete data.   Only makes a report if this
system is less than 60 days old.

=item B<-okay>

As B<-ok> except it will report on older systems.

=item B<-nok>

Report unsuccessful build on this system.  Forces B<-C>.  Forces and
supplies a value for B<-s>, then requires you to edit the report
and say what went wrong.  Alternatively, a prepared report may be
supplied using B<-f>.  Only prompts for a return address if it
cannot guess it (for use with B<make>). Honors return address
specified with B<-r>.  You can use this with B<-v> to get more
complete data.  Only makes a report if this system is less than 60
days old.

=item B<-nokay>

As B<-nok> except it will report on older systems.

=item B<-p>

The names of one or more patch files or other text attachments to be
included with the report.  Multiple files must be separated with commas.

=item B<-r>

Your return address.  The program will ask you to confirm its default
if you don't use this option.

=item B<-S>

Send without asking for confirmation.

=item B<-s>

Subject to include with the message.  You will be prompted if you don't
supply one on the command line.

=item B<-t>

Test mode.  The target address defaults to B<perlbug-test@perl.org>.

=item B<-T>

Send a thank-you note instead of a bug report. 

=item B<-v>

Include verbose configuration data in the report.

    resolve encoding to its (Encode) canonical name

The following are mainly of interest to Encode hackers:
  -C N | -c           check the validity of the input
  -D,--debug          show debug information
  -S,--scheme scheme  use the scheme for conversion
Those are handy when you can only see ASCII characters:
  -p,--perlqq         transliterate characters missing in encoding to \\x{HHHH}
                      where HHHH is the hexadecimal Unicode code point
  --htmlcref          transliterate characters missing in encoding to &#NNN;

  --xmlcref           transliterate characters missing in encoding to &#xHHHH;

=head1 NAME

piconv -- iconv(1), reinvented in perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  piconv [-f from_encoding] [-t to_encoding]
         [-p|--perlqq|--htmlcref|--xmlcref] [-C N|-c] [-D] [-S scheme]
         [-s string|file...]
  piconv -l
  piconv -r encoding_alias
  piconv -h

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<piconv> is perl version of B<iconv>, a character encoding converter
widely available for various Unixen today.  This script was primarily
a technology demonstrator for Perl 5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the
place of iconv for virtually any case.

piconv converts the character encoding of either STDIN or files
specified in the argument and prints out to STDOUT.

Here is the list of options.  Some options can be in short format (-f)
or long (--from) one.

=over 4

=item -f,--from I<from_encoding>

Specifies the encoding you are converting from.  Unlike B<iconv>,
this option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.

=item -t,--to I<to_encoding>

Specifies the encoding you are converting to.  Unlike B<iconv>,
this option can be omitted.  In such cases, the current locale is used.

Therefore, when both -f and -t are omitted, B<piconv> just acts
like B<cat>.

=item -s,--string I<string>

uses I<string> instead of file for the source of text.

=item -l,--list

Lists all available encodings, one per line, in case-insensitive
order.  Note that only the canonical names are listed; many aliases
exist.  For example, the names are case-insensitive, and many standard
and common aliases work, such as "latin1" for "ISO-8859-1", or "ibm850"
instead of "cp850", or "winlatin1" for "cp1252".  See L<Encode::Supported>
for a full discussion.

=item -r,--resolve I<encoding_alias>

Resolve I<encoding_alias> to Encode canonical encoding name.

=item -C,--check I<N>

Check the validity of the stream if I<N> = 1.  When I<N> = -1, something
interesting happens when it encounters an invalid character.

=item -c

Same as C<-C 1>.

=item -p,--perlqq

Transliterate characters missing in encoding to \x{HHHH} where HHHH is the
hexadecimal Unicode code point.

=item --htmlcref

Transliterate characters missing in encoding to &#NNN; where NNN is the
decimal Unicode code point.

=item --xmlcref

Transliterate characters missing in encoding to &#xHHHH; where HHHH is the
hexadecimal Unicode code point.

=item -h,--help

Show usage.

=item -D,--debug

Invokes debugging mode.  Primarily for Encode hackers.

=item -S,--scheme I<scheme>

Selects which scheme is to be used for conversion.  Available schemes
are as follows:

=over 4

=item from_to

Uses Encode::from_to for conversion.  This is the default.

=item decode_encode

Input strings are decode()d then encode()d.  A straight two-step
implementation.

=item perlio

The new perlIO layer is used.  NI-S' favorite.

You should use this option if you are using UTF-16 and others which
linefeed is not $/.

=back

Like the I<-D> option, this is also for Encode hackers.

=head1 NAME

pl2pm - Rough tool to translate Perl4 .pl files to Perl5 .pm modules.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pl2pm> F<files>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pl2pm> is a tool to aid in the conversion of Perl4-style .pl
library files to Perl5-style library modules.  Usually, your old .pl
file will still work fine and you should only use this tool if you
plan to update your library to use some of the newer Perl 5 features,
such as AutoLoading.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

It's just a first step, but it's usually a good first step.

=head1 NAME

pod2usage - print usage messages from embedded pod docs in files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over 12

=item B<pod2usage>

[B<-help>]
[B<-man>]
[B<-exit>S< >I<exitval>]
[B<-output>S< >I<outfile>]
[B<-verbose> I<level>]
[B<-pathlist> I<dirlist>]
[B<-formatter> I<module>]
[B<-utf8>]
I<file>

=back

=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

=over 8

=item B<-help>

Print a brief help message and exit.

=item B<-man>

Print this command's manual page and exit.

=item B<-exit> I<exitval>

The exit status value to return.

=item B<-output> I<outfile>

The output file to print to. If the special names "-" or ">&1" or ">&STDOUT"
are used then standard output is used. If ">&2" or ">&STDERR" is used then
standard error is used.

=item B<-verbose> I<level>

The desired level of verbosity to use:

    1 : print SYNOPSIS only
    2 : print SYNOPSIS sections and any OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS sections
    3 : print the entire manpage (similar to running pod2text)

=item B<-pathlist> I<dirlist>

Specifies one or more directories to search for the input file if it
was not supplied with an absolute path. Each directory path in the given
list should be separated by a ':' on Unix (';' on MSWin32 and DOS).

=item B<-formatter> I<module>

Which text formatter to use. Default is L<Pod::Text>, or for very old
Perl versions L<Pod::PlainText>. An alternative would be e.g. 
L<Pod::Text::Termcap>.

=item B<-utf8>

This option assumes that the formatter (see above) understands the option
"utf8". It turns on generation of utf8 output.

=item I<file>

The pathname of a file containing pod documentation to be output in
usage message format (defaults to standard input).

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pod2usage> will read the given input file looking for pod
documentation and will print the corresponding usage message.
If no input file is specified then standard input is read.

B<pod2usage> invokes the B<pod2usage()> function in the B<Pod::Usage>
module. Please see L<Pod::Usage/pod2usage()>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Pod::Usage>, L<pod2text(1)>

=head1 NAME

podchecker - check the syntax of POD format documentation files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<podchecker> [B<-help>] [B<-man>] [B<-(no)warnings>] [I<file>S< >...]

=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

=over 8

=item B<-help>

Print a brief help message and exit.

=item B<-man>

Print the manual page and exit.

=item B<-warnings> B<-nowarnings>

Turn on/off printing of warnings. Repeating B<-warnings> increases the
warning level, i.e. more warnings are printed. Currently increasing to
level two causes flagging of unescaped "E<lt>,E<gt>" characters.

=item I<file>

The pathname of a POD file to syntax-check (defaults to standard input).

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<podchecker> will read the given input files looking for POD
syntax errors in the POD documentation and will print any errors
it find to STDERR. At the end, it will print a status message
indicating the number of errors found.

Directories are ignored, an appropriate warning message is printed.

B<podchecker> invokes the B<podchecker()> function exported by B<Pod::Checker>
Please see L<Pod::Checker/podchecker()> for more details.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

B<podchecker> returns a 0 (zero) exit status if all specified
POD files are ok.

=head1 ERRORS

B<podchecker> returns the exit status 1 if at least one of
the given POD files has syntax errors.

The status 2 indicates that at least one of the specified 
files does not contain I<any> POD commands.

Status 1 overrides status 2. If you want unambiguous
results, call B<podchecker> with one single argument only.

This is set automatically if --max is given but                   may be cancelled by a later --strip=none.           unused: Remove chunks not used by libpng when decoding an image.                    This retains any chunks that might be used by libpng image                  transformations.            transform: unused+bKGD.         color:  transform+iCCP and cHRM.            all:    color+gAMA and sRGB.          Only ancillary chunks are ever removed.  In addition the tRNS and sBIT          chunks are never removed as they affect exact interpretation of the         image pixel values.  The following known chunks are treated specially       by the above options:         gAMA, sRGB [all]: These specify the gamma encoding used for the pixel               values.         cHRM, iCCP [color]: These specify how colors are encoded.  iCCP also                specifies the exact encoding of a pixel value; however, in              practice most programs will ignore it.          bKGD [transform]: This is used by libpng transforms.    --max=<number>:       Use IDAT chunks sized <number>.  If no number is given the the IDAT         chunks will be the maximum size permitted; 2^31-1 bytes.  If the option         is omitted the original chunk sizes will not be changed.  When the          option is given --strip=unsafe is set automatically. This may be        cancelled if you know that all unknown unsafe-to-copy chunks really are         safe to copy across an IDAT size change.  This is true of all chunks        that have ever been formally proposed as PNG extensions.    MESSAGES        By default the program only outputs summaries for each file.      --quiet (-q):         Do not output the summaries except for files that cannot be read. With          two --quiets these are not output either.     --errors (-e):        Output errors from libpng and the program (except too-far-back).      --warnings (-w):          Output warnings from libpng.    OUTPUT          By default nothing is written.        --out=<file>:         Write the optimized/corrected version of the next PNG to <file>.  This          overrides the following two options       --suffix=<suffix>:        Set --out=<name><suffix> for all following files unless overridden on       a per-file basis by explicit --out.       --prefix=<prefix>:        Set --out=<prefix><name> for all the following files unless overridden          on a per-file basis by explicit --out.          These two options can be used together to produce a suffix and prefix.      INTERNAL OPTIONS  EXIT CODES    *** SUBJECT TO CHANGE ***   The program exit code is value in the range 0..127 holding a bit mask of    the following codes.  Notice that the results for each file are combined    together - check one file at a time to get a meaningful error code!       0x01: The zlib too-far-back error existed in at least one chunk.        0x02: At least one chunk had a CRC error.       0x04: A chunk length was incorrect.     0x08: The file was truncated.     Errors less than 16 are potentially recoverable, for a single file if the   exit code is less than 16 the file could be read (with corrections if a     non-zero code is returned).       0x10: The file could not be read, even with corrections.        0x20: The output file could not be written.     0x40: An unexpected, potentially internal, error occurred.    If the command line arguments are incorrect the program exits with exit     255.  Some older operating systems only support 7-bit exit codes, on those      systems it is suggested that this program is first tested by supplying      invalid arguments.    DESCRIPTION   pngfix:     checks each PNG file on the command line for errors.  By default errors are     not output and the program just returns an exit code and prints a summary.      With the --quiet (-q) option the summaries are suppressed too and the   program only outputs unexpected errors (internal errors and file open   errors).    Various known problems in PNG files are fixed while the file is being read      The exit code says what problems were fixed.  In particular the zlib error:           "invalid distance too far back"   caused by an incorrect optimization of a zlib stream is fixed in any    compressed chunk in which it is encountered.  An integrity problem of the   PNG stream caused by a bug in libpng which wrote an incorrect chunk length      is also fixed.  Chunk CRC errors are automatically fixed up.    Setting one of the "OUTPUT" options causes the possibly modified file to    be written to a new file.   Notice that some PNG files with the zlib optimization problem can still be      read by libpng under some circumstances.  This program will still detect    and, if requested, correct the error.   The program will reliably process all files on the command line unless      either an invalid argument causes the usage message (this message) to be    produced or the program crashes.    The summary lines describe issues encountered with the zlib compressed      stream of a chunk.  They have the following format, which is SUBJECT TO     CHANGE in the future:      chunk reason comp-level p1 p2 p3 p4 file     p1 through p4 vary according to the 'reason'.

=head1 NAME

pod2html - convert .pod files to .html files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    pod2html --help --htmldir=<name> --htmlroot=<URL>
             --infile=<name> --outfile=<name>
             --podpath=<name>:...:<name> --podroot=<name>
             --cachedir=<name> --flush --recurse --norecurse
             --quiet --noquiet --verbose --noverbose
             --index --noindex --backlink --nobacklink
             --header --noheader --poderrors --nopoderrors
             --css=<URL> --title=<name>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Converts files from pod format (see L<perlpod>) to HTML format.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

pod2html takes the following arguments:

=over 4

=item help

  --help

Displays the usage message.

=item htmldir

  --htmldir=name

Sets the directory to which all cross references in the resulting HTML file
will be relative. Not passing this causes all links to be absolute since this
is the value that tells Pod::Html the root of the documentation tree.

Do not use this and --htmlroot in the same call to pod2html; they are mutually
exclusive.

=item htmlroot

  --htmlroot=URL

Sets the base URL for the HTML files.  When cross-references are made, the
HTML root is prepended to the URL.

Do not use this if relative links are desired: use --htmldir instead.

Do not pass both this and --htmldir to pod2html; they are mutually exclusive.

=item infile

  --infile=name

Specify the pod file to convert.  Input is taken from STDIN if no
infile is specified.

=item outfile

  --outfile=name

Specify the HTML file to create.  Output goes to STDOUT if no outfile
is specified.

=item podroot

  --podroot=name

Specify the base directory for finding library pods.

=item podpath

  --podpath=name:...:name

Specify which subdirectories of the podroot contain pod files whose
HTML converted forms can be linked-to in cross-references.

=item cachedir

  --cachedir=name

Specify which directory is used for storing cache. Default directory is the
current working directory.

=item flush

  --flush

Flush the cache.

=item backlink

  --backlink

Turn =head1 directives into links pointing to the top of the HTML file.

=item nobacklink

  --nobacklink

Do not turn =head1 directives into links pointing to the top of the HTML file
(default behaviour).

=item header

  --header

Create header and footer blocks containing the text of the "NAME" section.

=item noheader

  --noheader

Do not create header and footer blocks containing the text of the "NAME"
section (default behaviour).

=item poderrors

  --poderrors

Include a "POD ERRORS" section in the outfile if there were any POD errors in
the infile (default behaviour).

=item nopoderrors

  --nopoderrors

Do not include a "POD ERRORS" section in the outfile if there were any POD
errors in the infile.

=item index

  --index

Generate an index at the top of the HTML file (default behaviour).

=item noindex

  --noindex

Do not generate an index at the top of the HTML file.


=item recurse

  --recurse

Recurse into subdirectories specified in podpath (default behaviour).

=item norecurse

  --norecurse

Do not recurse into subdirectories specified in podpath.

=item css

  --css=URL

Specify the URL of cascading style sheet to link from resulting HTML file.
Default is none style sheet.

=item title

  --title=title

Specify the title of the resulting HTML file.

=item quiet

  --quiet

Don't display mostly harmless warning messages.

=item noquiet

  --noquiet

Display mostly harmless warning messages (default behaviour). But this is not
the same as "verbose" mode.

=item verbose

  --verbose

Display progress messages.

=item noverbose

  --noverbose

Do not display progress messages (default behaviour).

=back

pod2man B<--help>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pod2man> is a front-end for Pod::Man, using it to generate *roff input
from POD source.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a
terminal using nroff(1), normally via man(1), or printing using troff(1).

I<input> is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in
code).  If I<input> isn't given, it defaults to C<STDIN>.  I<output>, if
given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If I<output>
isn't given, the formatted output is written to C<STDOUT>.  Several POD
files can be processed in the same B<pod2man> invocation (saving module
load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of I<input> and
I<output> files on the command line.

B<--section>, B<--release>, B<--center>, B<--date>, and B<--official> can
be used to set the headers and footers to use; if not given, Pod::Man will
assume various defaults.  See below or L<Pod::Man> for details.

B<pod2man> assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font
named C<CW>.  If yours is called something else (like C<CR>), use
B<--fixed> to specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output
for printing.  Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and
bold italic fixed-width output.

Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man, and therefore pod2man also
takes care of formatting func(), func(n), and simple variable references
like $foo or @bar so you don't have to use code escapes for them; complex
expressions like C<$fred{'stuff'}> will still need to be escaped, though.
It also translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes, makes
long dashes--like this--into proper em dashes, fixes "paired quotes," and
takes care of several other troff-specific tweaks.  See L<Pod::Man> for
complete information.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-c> I<string>, B<--center>=I<string>

Sets the centered page header for the C<.TH> macro to I<string>.  The
default is "User Contributed Perl Documentation", but also see
B<--official> below.

=item B<-d> I<string>, B<--date>=I<string>

Set the left-hand footer string for the C<.TH> macro to I<string>.  By
default, the modification date of the input file will be used, or the
current date if input comes from C<STDIN>, and will be based on UTC (so
that the output will be reproducible regardless of local time zone).

=item B<--errors>=I<style>

Set the error handling style.  C<die> says to throw an exception on any
POD formatting error.  C<stderr> says to report errors on standard error,
but not to throw an exception.  C<pod> says to include a POD ERRORS
section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.  C<none>
ignores POD errors entirely, as much as possible.

The default is C<die>.

=item B<--fixed>=I<font>

The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults to
C<CW>.  Some systems may want C<CR> instead.  Only matters for troff(1)
output.

=item B<--fixedbold>=I<font>

Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to C<CB>.  Only matters
for troff(1) output.

=item B<--fixeditalic>=I<font>

Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer,
since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version, not an italic
version).  Defaults to C<CI>.  Only matters for troff(1) output.

=item B<--fixedbolditalic>=I<font>

Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width font.
Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to C<CB>.  Some
systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as C<CX>.  Only matters
for troff(1) output.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print out usage information.

=item B<-l>, B<--lax>

No longer used.  B<pod2man> used to check its input for validity as a
manual page, but this should now be done by L<podchecker(1)> instead.
Accepted for backward compatibility; this option no longer does anything.

=item B<-n> I<name>, B<--name>=I<name>

Set the name of the manual page for the C<.TH> macro to I<name>.  Without
this option, the manual name is set to the uppercased base name of the
file being converted unless the manual section is 3, in which case the
path is parsed to see if it is a Perl module path.  If it is, a path like
C<.../lib/Pod/Man.pm> is converted into a name like C<Pod::Man>.  This
option, if given, overrides any automatic determination of the name.

Although one does not have to follow this convention, be aware that the
convention for UNIX man pages for commands is for the man page title to be
in all-uppercase, even if the command isn't.

This option is probably not useful when converting multiple POD files at
once.

When converting POD source from standard input, this option is required,
since there's otherwise no way to know what to use as the name of the
manual page.

=item B<--nourls>

Normally, LZ<><> formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are formatted
to show both the anchor text and the URL.  In other words:

    L<foo|http://example.com/>

is formatted as:

    foo <http://example.com/>

This flag, if given, suppresses the URL when anchor text is given, so this
example would be formatted as just C<foo>.  This can produce less
cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly important.

=item B<-o>, B<--official>

Set the default header to indicate that this page is part of the standard
Perl release, if B<--center> is not also given.

=item B<-q> I<quotes>, B<--quotes>=I<quotes>

Sets the quote marks used to surround CE<lt>> text to I<quotes>.  If
I<quotes> is a single character, it is used as both the left and right
quote.  Otherwise, it is split in half, and the first half of the string
is used as the left quote and the second is used as the right quote.

I<quotes> may also be set to the special value C<none>, in which case no
quote marks are added around CE<lt>> text (but the font is still changed for
troff output).

=item B<-r> I<version>, B<--release>=I<version>

Set the centered footer for the C<.TH> macro to I<version>.  By default,
this is set to the version of Perl you run B<pod2man> under.  Setting this
to the empty string will cause some *roff implementations to use the
system default value.

Note that some system C<an> macro sets assume that the centered footer
will be a modification date and will prepend something like "Last
modified: ".  If this is the case for your target system, you may want to
set B<--release> to the last modified date and B<--date> to the version
number.

=item B<-s> I<string>, B<--section>=I<string>

Set the section for the C<.TH> macro.  The standard section numbering
convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for
functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There is a lot
of variation here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file
formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices.  Still others
use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers
that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.

By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in C<.pm>, in
which case section 3 will be selected.

=item B<--stderr>

By default, B<pod2man> dies if any errors are detected in the POD input.
If B<--stderr> is given and no B<--errors> flag is present, errors are
sent to standard error, but B<pod2man> does not abort.  This is equivalent
to C<--errors=stderr> and is supported for backward compatibility.

=item B<-u>, B<--utf8>

By default, B<pod2man> produces the most conservative possible *roff
output to try to ensure that it will work with as many different *roff
implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations cannot handle
non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters are converted
either to a *roff escape sequence that tries to create a properly accented
character (at least for troff output) or to C<X>.

This option says to instead output literal UTF-8 characters.  If your
*roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output format to use
and avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII characters.
However, be warned that *roff source with literal UTF-8 characters is not
supported by many implementations and may even result in segfaults and
other bad behavior.

Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your POD
source should be properly declared unless it's US-ASCII.  Pod::Simple will
attempt to guess the encoding and may be successful if it's Latin-1 or
UTF-8, but it will warn, which by default results in a B<pod2man> failure.
Use the C<=encoding> command to declare the encoding.  See L<perlpod(1)>
for more information.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose>

Print out the name of each output file as it is being generated.

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

As long as all documents processed result in some output, even if that
output includes errata (a C<POD ERRORS> section generated with
C<--errors=pod>), B<pod2man> will exit with status 0.  If any of the
documents being processed do not result in an output document, B<pod2man>
will exit with status 1.  If there are syntax errors in a POD document
being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of
C<die>, B<pod2man> will abort immediately with exit status 255.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

If B<pod2man> fails with errors, see L<Pod::Man> and L<Pod::Simple> for
information about what those errors might mean.

=head1 EXAMPLES

    pod2man program > program.1
    pod2man SomeModule.pm /usr/perl/man/man3/SomeModule.3
    pod2man --section=7 note.pod > note.7

If you would like to print out a lot of man page continuously, you probably
want to set the C and D registers to set contiguous page numbering and
even/odd paging, at least on some versions of man(7).

    troff -man -rC1 -rD1 perl.1 perldata.1 perlsyn.1 ...

To get index entries on C<STDERR>, turn on the F register, as in:

    troff -man -rF1 perl.1

The indexing merely outputs messages via C<.tm> for each major page,
section, subsection, item, and any C<XE<lt>E<gt>> directives.  See
L<Pod::Man> for more details.

=head1 BUGS

Lots of this documentation is duplicated from L<Pod::Man>.

=head1 NAME

pod2text - Convert POD data to formatted ASCII text

=head1 SYNOPSIS

pod2text [B<-aclostu>] [B<--code>] [B<--errors>=I<style>] [B<-i> I<indent>]
    S<[B<-q> I<quotes>]> [B<--nourls>] [B<--stderr>] S<[B<-w> I<width>]>
    [I<input> [I<output> ...]]

pod2text B<-h>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pod2text> is a front-end for Pod::Text and its subclasses.  It uses them
to generate formatted ASCII text from POD source.  It can optionally use
either termcap sequences or ANSI color escape sequences to format the text.

I<input> is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in
code).  If I<input> isn't given, it defaults to C<STDIN>.  I<output>, if
given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If I<output>
isn't given, the formatted output is written to C<STDOUT>.  Several POD
files can be processed in the same B<pod2text> invocation (saving module
load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of I<input> and
I<output> files on the command line.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-a>, B<--alt>

Use an alternate output format that, among other things, uses a different
heading style and marks C<=item> entries with a colon in the left margin.

=item B<--code>

Include any non-POD text from the input file in the output as well.  Useful
for viewing code documented with POD blocks with the POD rendered and the
code left intact.

=item B<-c>, B<--color>

Format the output with ANSI color escape sequences.  Using this option
requires that Term::ANSIColor be installed on your system.

=item B<--errors>=I<style>

Set the error handling style.  C<die> says to throw an exception on any
POD formatting error.  C<stderr> says to report errors on standard error,
but not to throw an exception.  C<pod> says to include a POD ERRORS
section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.  C<none>
ignores POD errors entirely, as much as possible.

The default is C<die>.

=item B<-i> I<indent>, B<--indent=>I<indent>

Set the number of spaces to indent regular text, and the default indentation
for C<=over> blocks.  Defaults to 4 spaces if this option isn't given.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print out usage information and exit.

=item B<-l>, B<--loose>

Print a blank line after a C<=head1> heading.  Normally, no blank line is
printed after C<=head1>, although one is still printed after C<=head2>,
because this is the expected formatting for manual pages; if you're
formatting arbitrary text documents, using this option is recommended.

=item B<-m> I<width>, B<--left-margin>=I<width>, B<--margin>=I<width>

The width of the left margin in spaces.  Defaults to 0.  This is the margin
for all text, including headings, not the amount by which regular text is
indented; for the latter, see B<-i> option.

=item B<--nourls>

Normally, LZ<><> formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are formatted
to show both the anchor text and the URL.  In other words:

    L<foo|http://example.com/>

is formatted as:

    foo <http://example.com/>

This flag, if given, suppresses the URL when anchor text is given, so this
example would be formatted as just C<foo>.  This can produce less
cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly important.

=item B<-o>, B<--overstrike>

Format the output with overstrike printing.  Bold text is rendered as
character, backspace, character.  Italics and file names are rendered as
underscore, backspace, character.  Many pagers, such as B<less>, know how
to convert this to bold or underlined text.

=item B<-q> I<quotes>, B<--quotes>=I<quotes>

Sets the quote marks used to surround CE<lt>> text to I<quotes>.  If
I<quotes> is a single character, it is used as both the left and right
quote.  Otherwise, it is split in half, and the first half of the string
is used as the left quote and the second is used as the right quote.

I<quotes> may also be set to the special value C<none>, in which case no
quote marks are added around CE<lt>> text.

=item B<-s>, B<--sentence>

Assume each sentence ends with two spaces and try to preserve that spacing.
Without this option, all consecutive whitespace in non-verbatim paragraphs
is compressed into a single space.

=item B<--stderr>

By default, B<pod2text> dies if any errors are detected in the POD input.
If B<--stderr> is given and no B<--errors> flag is present, errors are
sent to standard error, but B<pod2text> does not abort.  This is
equivalent to C<--errors=stderr> and is supported for backward
compatibility.

=item B<-t>, B<--termcap>

Try to determine the width of the screen and the bold and underline
sequences for the terminal from termcap, and use that information in
formatting the output.  Output will be wrapped at two columns less than the
width of your terminal device.  Using this option requires that your system
have a termcap file somewhere where Term::Cap can find it and requires that
your system support termios.  With this option, the output of B<pod2text>
will contain terminal control sequences for your current terminal type.

=item B<-u>, B<--utf8>

By default, B<pod2text> tries to use the same output encoding as its input
encoding (to be backward-compatible with older versions).  This option
says to instead force the output encoding to UTF-8.

Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your POD
source should be properly declared unless it's US-ASCII.  Pod::Simple
will attempt to guess the encoding and may be successful if it's
Latin-1 or UTF-8, but it will warn, which by default results in a
B<pod2text> failure.  Use the C<=encoding> command to declare the
encoding.  See L<perlpod(1)> for more information.

=item B<-w>, B<--width=>I<width>, B<->I<width>

The column at which to wrap text on the right-hand side.  Defaults to 76,
unless B<-t> is given, in which case it's two columns less than the width of
your terminal device.

=back

=head1 EXIT STATUS

As long as all documents processed result in some output, even if that
output includes errata (a C<POD ERRORS> section generated with
C<--errors=pod>), B<pod2text> will exit with status 0.  If any of the
documents being processed do not result in an output document, B<pod2text>
will exit with status 1.  If there are syntax errors in a POD document
being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of
C<die>, B<pod2text> will abort immediately with exit status 255.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

If B<pod2text> fails with errors, see L<Pod::Text> and L<Pod::Simple> for
information about what those errors might mean.  Internally, it can also
produce the following diagnostics:

=over 4

=item -c (--color) requires Term::ANSIColor be installed

(F) B<-c> or B<--color> were given, but Term::ANSIColor could not be
loaded.

=item Unknown option: %s

(F) An unknown command line option was given.

=back

In addition, other L<Getopt::Long> error messages may result from invalid
command-line options.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item COLUMNS

If B<-t> is given, B<pod2text> will take the current width of your screen
from this environment variable, if available.  It overrides terminal width
information in TERMCAP.

=item TERMCAP

If B<-t> is given, B<pod2text> will use the contents of this environment
variable if available to determine the correct formatting sequences for your
current terminal device.

  Usage: %s [OPTION]... [FILE]...
    Paginate or columnate FILE(s) for printing.
    
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
 
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
    +FIRST_PAGE[:LAST_PAGE], --pages=FIRST_PAGE[:LAST_PAGE]
                    begin [stop] printing with page FIRST_[LAST_]PAGE
  -COLUMN, --columns=COLUMN
                    output COLUMN columns and print columns down,
                    unless -a is used. Balance number of lines in the
                    columns on each page
     -a, --across      print columns across rather than down, used together
                    with -COLUMN
  -c, --show-control-chars
                    use hat notation (^G) and octal backslash notation
  -d, --double-space
                    double space the output
     -D, --date-format=FORMAT
                    use FORMAT for the header date
  -e[CHAR[WIDTH]], --expand-tabs[=CHAR[WIDTH]]
                    expand input CHARs (TABs) to tab WIDTH (8)
  -F, -f, --form-feed
                    use form feeds instead of newlines to separate pages
                    (by a 3-line page header with -F or a 5-line header
                    and trailer without -F)
   -h, --header=HEADER
                    use a centered HEADER instead of filename in page header,
                    -h "" prints a blank line, don't use -h""
  -i[CHAR[WIDTH]], --output-tabs[=CHAR[WIDTH]]
                    replace spaces with CHARs (TABs) to tab WIDTH (8)
  -J, --join-lines  merge full lines, turns off -W line truncation, no column
                    alignment, --sep-string[=STRING] sets separators
    -l, --length=PAGE_LENGTH
                    set the page length to PAGE_LENGTH (66) lines
                    (default number of lines of text 56, and with -F 63).
                    implies -t if PAGE_LENGTH <= 10
   -m, --merge       print all files in parallel, one in each column,
                    truncate lines, but join lines of full length with -J
   -n[SEP[DIGITS]], --number-lines[=SEP[DIGITS]]
                    number lines, use DIGITS (5) digits, then SEP (TAB),
                    default counting starts with 1st line of input file
  -N, --first-line-number=NUMBER
                    start counting with NUMBER at 1st line of first
                    page printed (see +FIRST_PAGE)
     -o, --indent=MARGIN
                    offset each line with MARGIN (zero) spaces, do not
                    affect -w or -W, MARGIN will be added to PAGE_WIDTH
  -r, --no-file-warnings
                    omit warning when a file cannot be opened
      -s[CHAR], --separator[=CHAR]
                    separate columns by a single character, default for CHAR
                    is the <TAB> character without -w and 'no char' with -w.
                    -s[CHAR] turns off line truncation of all 3 column
                    options (-COLUMN|-a -COLUMN|-m) except -w is set
     -S[STRING], --sep-string[=STRING]
                    separate columns by STRING,
                    without -S: Default separator <TAB> with -J and <space>
                    otherwise (same as -S" "), no effect on column options
   -t, --omit-header  omit page headers and trailers;
                     implied if PAGE_LENGTH <= 10
   -T, --omit-pagination
                    omit page headers and trailers, eliminate any pagination
                    by form feeds set in input files
  -v, --show-nonprinting
                    use octal backslash notation
  -w, --width=PAGE_WIDTH
                    set page width to PAGE_WIDTH (72) characters for
                    multiple text-column output only, -s[char] turns off (72)
      -W, --page-width=PAGE_WIDTH
                    set page width to PAGE_WIDTH (72) characters always,
                    truncate lines, except -J option is set, no interference
                    with -S or -s

=head1 NAME

rename - renames multiple files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rename> S<[ B<-v> ]> S<[ B<-n> ]> S<[ B<-f> ]> I<perlexpr> S<[ I<files> ]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<rename>
renames the filenames supplied according to the rule specified as the
first argument.
The I<perlexpr> 
argument is a Perl expression which is expected to modify the C<$_>
string in Perl for at least some of the filenames specified.
If a given filename is not modified by the expression, it will not be
renamed.
If no filenames are given on the command line, filenames will be read
via standard input.

For example, to rename all files matching C<*.bak> to strip the extension,
you might say

	rename 's/\.bak$//' *.bak

To translate uppercase names to lower, you'd use

	rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose>

Verbose: print names of files successfully renamed.

=item B<-n>, B<--no-act>

No Action: show what files would have been renamed.

=item B<-f>, B<--force>

Force: overwrite existing files.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

No environment variables are used.

=head1 AUTHOR

Larry Wall

=head1 SEE ALSO

mv(1), perl(1)

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

If you give an invalid Perl expression you'll get a syntax error.

=head1 BUGS

The original C<rename> did not check for the existence of target filenames,
so had to be used with care.  I hope I've fixed that (Robin Barker).

=head1 NAME

ptargrep - Apply pattern matching to the contents of files in a tar archive

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  ptargrep [options] <pattern> <tar file> ...

  Options:

   --basename|-b     ignore directory paths from archive
   --ignore-case|-i  do case-insensitive pattern matching
   --list-only|-l    list matching filenames rather than extracting matches
   --verbose|-v      write debugging message to STDERR
   --help|-?         detailed help message

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility allows you to apply pattern matching to B<the contents> of files
contained in a tar archive.  You might use this to identify all files in an
archive which contain lines matching the specified pattern and either print out
the pathnames or extract the files.

The pattern will be used as a Perl regular expression (as opposed to a simple
grep regex).

Multiple tar archive filenames can be specified - they will each be processed
in turn.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--basename> (alias -b)

When matching files are extracted, ignore the directory path from the archive
and write to the current directory using the basename of the file from the
archive.  Beware: if two matching files in the archive have the same basename,
the second file extracted will overwrite the first.

=item B<--ignore-case> (alias -i)

Make pattern matching case-insensitive.

=item B<--list-only> (alias -l)

Print the pathname of each matching file from the archive to STDOUT.  Without
this option, the default behaviour is to extract each matching file.

=item B<--verbose> (alias -v)

Log debugging info to STDERR.

=item B<--help> (alias -?)

Display this documentation.

  %b      ARGUMENT as a string with '\' escapes interpreted,
          except that octal escapes are of the form \0 or \0NNN
  %q      ARGUMENT is printed in a format that can be reused as shell input,
          escaping non-printable characters with the proposed POSIX $'' syntax.

and all C format specifications ending with one of diouxXfeEgGcs, with
ARGUMENTs converted to proper type first.  Variable widths are handled.

NOTE: your shell may have its own version of %s, which usually supersedes
the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation
for details about the options it supports.

Usage:  ptardiff ARCHIVE_FILE
        ptardiff -h

    ptardiff is a small program that diffs an extracted archive
    against an unextracted one, using the perl module Archive::Tar.

    This effectively lets you view changes made to an archives contents.

    Provide the progam with an ARCHIVE_FILE and it will look up all
    the files with in the archive, scan the current working directory
    for a file with the name and diff it against the contents of the
    archive.

=head1 NOTES

=head2 .proverc

If F<~/.proverc> or F<./.proverc> exist they will be read and any
options they contain processed before the command line options. Options
in F<.proverc> are specified in the same way as command line options:

    # .proverc
    --state=hot,fast,save
    -j9

Additional option files may be specified with the C<--rc> option.
Default option file processing is disabled by the C<--norc> option.

Under Windows and VMS the option file is named F<_proverc> rather than
F<.proverc> and is sought only in the current directory.

=head2 Reading from C<STDIN>

If you have a list of tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to test) in a
file, you can add them to your tests by using a '-':

 prove - < my_list_of_things_to_test.txt

See the C<README> in the C<examples> directory of this distribution.

=head2 Default Test Directory

If no files or directories are supplied, C<prove> looks for all files
matching the pattern C<t/*.t>.

=head2 Colored Test Output

Colored test output using L<TAP::Formatter::Color> is the default, but 
if output is not to a terminal, color is disabled. You can override this by 
adding the C<--color> switch.

Color support requires L<Term::ANSIColor> on Unix-like platforms and
L<Win32::Console> on windows. If the necessary module is not installed
colored output will not be available.

=head2 Exit Code

If the tests fail C<prove> will exit with non-zero status.

=head2 Arguments to Tests

It is possible to supply arguments to tests. To do so separate them from
prove's own arguments with the arisdottle, '::'. For example

 prove -v t/mytest.t :: --url http://example.com

would run F<t/mytest.t> with the options '--url http://example.com'.
When running multiple tests they will each receive the same arguments.

=head2 C<--exec>

Normally you can just pass a list of Perl tests and the harness will know how
to execute them.  However, if your tests are not written in Perl or if you
want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the C<-e>, or C<--exec>
switch:

 prove --exec '/usr/bin/ruby -w' t/
 prove --exec '/usr/bin/perl -Tw -mstrict -Ilib' t/
 prove --exec '/path/to/my/customer/exec'

=head2 C<--merge>

If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct
order relative to test results you can use the C<--merge> option to
merge the test scripts' STDERR into their STDOUT.

This guarantees that STDOUT (where the test results appear) and STDERR
(where the diagnostics appear) will stay in sync. The harness will
display any diagnostics your tests emit on STDERR.

Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything
that appears on STDERR looks like a test result the test harness will
get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences
and can live with the risk.

=head2 C<--trap>

The C<--trap> option will attempt to trap SIGINT (Ctrl-C) during a test
run and display the test summary even if the run is interrupted

=head2 C<--state>

You can ask C<prove> to remember the state of previous test runs and
select and/or order the tests to be run based on that saved state.

The C<--state> switch requires an argument which must be a comma
separated list of one or more of the following options.

=over

=item C<last>

Run the same tests as the last time the state was saved. This makes it
possible, for example, to recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.

    # Run all tests in random order
    $ prove -b --state=save --shuffle

    # Run them again in the same order
    $ prove -b --state=last

=item C<failed>

Run only the tests that failed on the last run.

    # Run all tests
    $ prove -b --state=save

    # Run failures
    $ prove -b --state=failed

If you also specify the C<save> option newly passing tests will be
excluded from subsequent runs.

    # Repeat until no more failures
    $ prove -b --state=failed,save

=item C<passed>

Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful to make sure that no
new problems have been introduced.

=item C<all>

Run all tests in normal order. Multple options may be specified, so to
run all tests with the failures from last time first:

    $ prove -b --state=failed,all,save

=item C<hot>

Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure time of
each test is stored. The C<hot> option causes tests to be run in most-recent-
failure order.

    $ prove -b --state=hot,save

Tests that have never failed will not be selected. To run all tests with
the most recently failed first use

    $ prove -b --state=hot,all,save

This combination of options may also be specified thus

    $ prove -b --state=adrian

=item C<todo>

Run any tests with todos.

=item C<slow>

Run the tests in slowest to fastest order. This is useful in conjunction
with the C<-j> parallel testing switch to ensure that your slowest tests
start running first.

    $ prove -b --state=slow -j9

=item C<fast>

Run test tests in fastest to slowest order.

=item C<new>

Run the tests in newest to oldest order based on the modification times
of the test scripts.

=item C<old>

Run the tests in oldest to newest order.

=item C<fresh>

Run those test scripts that have been modified since the last test run.

=item C<save>

Save the state on exit. The state is stored in a file called F<.prove>
(F<_prove> on Windows and VMS) in the current directory.

=back

The C<--state> switch may be used more than once.

    $ prove -b --state=hot --state=all,save

=head2 --rules

The C<--rules> option is used to control which tests are run sequentially and
which are run in parallel, if the C<--jobs> option is specified. The option may
be specified multiple times, and the order matters.

The most practical use is likely to specify that some tests are not
"parallel-ready".  Since mentioning a file with --rules doesn't cause it to
be selected to run as a test, you can "set and forget" some rules preferences in
your .proverc file. Then you'll be able to take maximum advantage of the
performance benefits of parallel testing, while some exceptions are still run
in parallel.

=head3 --rules examples

    # All tests are allowed to run in parallel, except those starting with "p"
    --rules='seq=t/p*.t' --rules='par=**'

    # All tests must run in sequence except those starting with "p", which should be run parallel
    --rules='par=t/p*.t'

=head3 --rules resolution

=over 4

=item * By default, all tests are eligible to be run in parallel. Specifying any of your own rules removes this one.

=item * "First match wins". The first rule that matches a test will be the one that applies.

=item * Any test which does not match a rule will be run in sequence at the end of the run.

=item * The existence of a rule does not imply selecting a test. You must still specify the tests to run.

=item * Specifying a rule to allow tests to run in parallel does not make them run in parallel. You still need specify the number of parallel C<jobs> in your Harness object.

=back

=head3 --rules Glob-style pattern matching

We implement our own glob-style pattern matching for --rules. Here are the
supported patterns:

    ** is any number of characters, including /, within a pathname
    * is zero or more characters within a filename/directory name
    ? is exactly one character within a filename/directory name
    {foo,bar,baz} is any of foo, bar or baz.
    \ is an escape character

=head3 More advanced specifications for parallel vs sequence run rules

If you need more advanced management of what runs in parallel vs in sequence, see
the associated 'rules' documentation in L<TAP::Harness> and L<TAP::Parser::Scheduler>.
If what's possible directly through C<prove> is not sufficient, you can write your own
harness to access these features directly.

=head2 @INC

prove introduces a separation between "options passed to the perl which
runs prove" and "options passed to the perl which runs tests"; this
distinction is by design. Thus the perl which is running a test starts
with the default C<@INC>. Additional library directories can be added
via the C<PERL5LIB> environment variable, via -Ifoo in C<PERL5OPT> or
via the C<-Ilib> option to F<prove>.

=head2 Taint Mode

Normally when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of the
C<PERL5LIB> environment variable do not appear in C<@INC>.

Because C<PERL5LIB> is often used during testing to add build
directories to C<@INC> prove passes the names of any directories found
in C<PERL5LIB> as -I switches. The net effect of this is that
C<PERL5LIB> is honoured even when prove is run in taint mode.


=head1 FORMATTERS

You can load a custom L<TAP::Parser::Formatter>:

  prove --formatter MyFormatter

=head1 SOURCE HANDLERS

You can load custom L<TAP::Parser::SourceHandler>s, to change the way the
parser interprets particular I<sources> of TAP.

  prove --source MyHandler --source YetAnother t

If you want to provide config to the source you can use:

  prove --source MyCustom \
        --source Perl --perl-option 'foo=bar baz' --perl-option avg=0.278 \
        --source File --file-option extensions=.txt --file-option extensions=.tmp t
        --source pgTAP --pgtap-option pset=format=html --pgtap-option pset=border=2

Each C<--$source-option> option must specify a key/value pair separated by an
C<=>. If an option can take multiple values, just specify it multiple times,
as with the C<extensions=> examples above. If the option should be a hash
reference, specify the value as a second pair separated by a C<=>, as in the
C<pset=> examples above (escape C<=> with a backslash).

All C<--sources> are combined into a hash, and passed to L<TAP::Harness/new>'s
C<sources> parameter.

See L<TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory> for more details on how configuration is
passed to I<SourceHandlers>.

=head1 PLUGINS

Plugins can be loaded using the C<< -PI<plugin> >> syntax, eg:

  prove -PMyPlugin

This will search for a module named C<App::Prove::Plugin::MyPlugin>, or failing
that, C<MyPlugin>.  If the plugin can't be found, C<prove> will complain & exit.

You can pass arguments to your plugin by appending C<=arg1,arg2,etc> to the
plugin name:

  prove -PMyPlugin=fou,du,fafa

Please check individual plugin documentation for more details.

=head2 Available Plugins

For an up-to-date list of plugins available, please check CPAN:

L<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=App%3A%3AProve+Plugin>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The following is the old c2ph.doc documentation by Tom Christiansen
<tchrist@perl.com>
Date: 25 Jul 91 08:10:21 GMT

Once upon a time, I wrote a program called pstruct.  It was a perl
program that tried to parse out C structures and display their member
offsets for you.  This was especially useful for people looking at
binary dumps or poking around the kernel.

Pstruct was not a pretty program.  Neither was it particularly robust.
The problem, you see, was that the C compiler was much better at parsing
C than I could ever hope to be.

So I got smart:  I decided to be lazy and let the C compiler parse the C,
which would spit out debugger stabs for me to read.  These were much
easier to parse.  It's still not a pretty program, but at least it's more
robust.

Pstruct takes any .c or .h files, or preferably .s ones, since that's
the format it is going to massage them into anyway, and spits out
listings like this:

Actually, this was generated by a particular set of options.  You can control
the formatting of each column, whether you prefer wide or fat, hex or decimal,
leading zeroes or whatever.

All you need to be able to use this is a C compiler than generates
BSD/GCC-style stabs.  The B<-g> option on native BSD compilers and GCC
should get this for you.

To learn more, just type a bogus option, like B<-\?>, and a long usage message
will be provided.  There are a fair number of possibilities.

If you're only a C programmer, than this is the end of the message for you.
You can quit right now, and if you care to, save off the source and run it
when you feel like it.  Or not.



But if you're a perl programmer, then for you I have something much more
wondrous than just a structure offset printer.

You see, if you call pstruct by its other incybernation, c2ph, you have a code
generator that translates C code into perl code!  Well, structure and union
declarations at least, but that's quite a bit.

Prior to this point, anyone programming in perl who wanted to interact
with C programs, like the kernel, was forced to guess the layouts of
the C structures, and then hardwire these into his program.  Of course,
when you took your wonderfully crafted program to a system where the
sgtty structure was laid out differently, your program broke.  Which is
a shame.

We've had Larry's h2ph translator, which helped, but that only works on
cpp symbols, not real C, which was also very much needed.  What I offer
you is a symbolic way of getting at all the C structures.  I've couched
them in terms of packages and functions.  Consider the following program:

    #!/usr/local/bin/perl

    require 'syscall.ph';
    require 'sys/time.ph';
    require 'sys/resource.ph';

    $ru = "\0" x &rusage'sizeof();

    syscall(&SYS_getrusage, &RUSAGE_SELF, $ru)   && die "getrusage: $!";

    @ru = unpack($t = &rusage'typedef(), $ru);

    $utime =  $ru[ &rusage'ru_utime + &timeval'tv_sec  ]
	   + ($ru[ &rusage'ru_utime + &timeval'tv_usec ]) / 1e6;

    $stime =  $ru[ &rusage'ru_stime + &timeval'tv_sec  ]
	   + ($ru[ &rusage'ru_stime + &timeval'tv_usec ]) / 1e6;

    printf "you have used %8.3fs+%8.3fu seconds.\n", $utime, $stime;


As you see, the name of the package is the name of the structure.  Regular
fields are just their own names.  Plus the following accessor functions are
provided for your convenience:

 struct      This takes no arguments, and is merely the number of first-
             level elements in the structure.  You would use this for
             indexing into arrays of structures, perhaps like this

                 $usec = $u[ &user'u_utimer
                             + (&ITIMER_VIRTUAL * &itimerval'struct)
                             + &itimerval'it_value
                             + &timeval'tv_usec
                           ];

 sizeof      Returns the bytes in the structure, or the member if
             you pass it an argument, such as

                 &rusage'sizeof(&rusage'ru_utime)

 typedef     This is the perl format definition for passing to pack and
             unpack.  If you ask for the typedef of a nothing, you get
             the whole structure, otherwise you get that of the member
             you ask for.  Padding is taken care of, as is the magic to
             guarantee that a union is unpacked into all its aliases.
             Bitfields are not quite yet supported however.

 offsetof    This function is the byte offset into the array of that
             member.  You may wish to use this for indexing directly
             into the packed structure with vec() if you're too lazy
             to unpack it.

 typeof      Not to be confused with the typedef accessor function, this
             one returns the C type of that field.  This would allow
             you to print out a nice structured pretty print of some
             structure without knoning anything about it beforehand.
             No args to this one is a noop.  Someday I'll post such
             a thing to dump out your u structure for you.


The way I see this being used is like basically this:

        % h2ph <some_include_file.h  >  /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
        % c2ph  some_include_file.h  >> /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
        % install

It's a little tricker with c2ph because you have to get the includes right.
I can't know this for your system, but it's not usually too terribly difficult.

The code isn't pretty as I mentioned  -- I never thought it would be a 1000-
line program when I started, or I might not have begun. :-)  But I would have
been less cavalier in how the parts of the program communicated with each
other, etc.  It might also have helped if I didn't have to divine the makeup
of the stabs on the fly, and then account for micro differences between my
compiler and gcc.

Anyway, here it is.  Should run on perl v4 or greater.  Maybe less.

# Added checks that _() only contains string literals, and
# command line args are resolved to module lists, i.e. you

# Made docstring fit in 80 chars wide displays using pydoc.

Many systems (Solaris, Linux, Gnu) provide extensive tools that ease the
internationalization of C programs. Most of these tools are independent of
the programming language and can be used from within Python programs.
Martin von Loewis' work[1] helps considerably in this regard.

There's one problem though; xgettext is the program that scans source code
looking for message strings, but it groks only C (or C++). Python
introduces a few wrinkles, such as dual quoting characters, triple quoted
strings, and raw strings. xgettext understands none of this.

Enter pygettext, which uses Python's standard tokenize module to scan
Python source code, generating .pot files identical to what GNU xgettext[2]
generates for C and C++ code. From there, the standard GNU tools can be
used.

A word about marking Python strings as candidates for translation. GNU
xgettext recognizes the following keywords: gettext, dgettext, dcgettext,
and gettext_noop. But those can be a lot of text to include all over your
code. C and C++ have a trick: they use the C preprocessor. Most
internationalized C source includes a #define for gettext() to _() so that
what has to be written in the source is much less. Thus these are both
translatable strings:

    gettext("Translatable String")
    _("Translatable String")

Python of course has no preprocessor so this doesn't work so well.  Thus,
pygettext searches only for _() by default, but see the -k/--keyword flag
below for how to augment this.

NOTE: pygettext attempts to be option and feature compatible with GNU
xgettext where ever possible. However some options are still missing or are
not fully implemented. Also, xgettext's use of command line switches with
option arguments is broken, and in these cases, pygettext just defines
additional switches.

Usage: pygettext [options] inputfile ...

Options:

    -a
    --extract-all
        Extract all strings.

    -d name
    --default-domain=name
        Rename the default output file from messages.pot to name.pot.

    -E
    --escape
        Replace non-ASCII characters with octal escape sequences.

    -D
    --docstrings
        Extract module, class, method, and function docstrings.  These do
        not need to be wrapped in _() markers, and in fact cannot be for
        Python to consider them docstrings. (See also the -X option).

    -h
    --help
        Print this help message and exit.

    -k word
    --keyword=word
        Keywords to look for in addition to the default set, which are:
        %(DEFAULTKEYWORDS)s

        You can have multiple -k flags on the command line.

    -K
    --no-default-keywords
        Disable the default set of keywords (see above).  Any keywords
        explicitly added with the -k/--keyword option are still recognized.

    --no-location
        Do not write filename/lineno location comments.

    -n
    --add-location
        Write filename/lineno location comments indicating where each
        extracted string is found in the source.  These lines appear before
        each msgid.  The style of comments is controlled by the -S/--style
        option.  This is the default.

    -o filename
    --output=filename
        Rename the default output file from messages.pot to filename.  If
        filen
