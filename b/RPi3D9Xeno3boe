==============================================================================
1. Design goals						*design-goals*

Most important things come first (roughly).

Note that quite a few items are contradicting.  This is intentional.  A
balance must be found between them.


VIM IS... VI COMPATIBLE					*design-compatible*

First of all, it should be possible to use Vim as a drop-in replacement for
Vi.  When the user wants to, he can use Vim in compatible mode and hardly
notice any difference with the original Vi.

Exceptions:
- We don't reproduce obvious Vi bugs in Vim.
- There are different versions of Vi.  I am using Version 3.7 (6/7/85) as a
  reference.  But support for other versions is also included when possible.
  The Vi part of POSIX is not considered a definitive source.
- Vim adds new commands, you cannot rely on some command to fail because it
  didn't exist in Vi.
- Vim will have a lot of features that Vi doesn't have.  Going back from Vim
  to Vi will be a problem, this cannot be avoided.
- Some things are hardly ever used (open mode, sending an e-mail when
  crashing, etc.).  Those will only be included when someone has a good reason
  why it should be included and it's not too much work.
- For some items it is debatable whether Vi compatibility should be
  maintained.  There will be an option flag for these.


VIM IS... IMPROVED					*design-improved*

The IMproved bits of Vim should make it a better Vi, without becoming a
completely different editor.  Extensions are done with a "Vi spirit".
- Use the keyboard as much as feasible.  The mouse requires a third hand,
  which we don't have.  Many terminals don't have a mouse.
- When the mouse is used anyway, avoid the need to switch back to the
  keyboard.  Avoid mixing mouse and keyboard handling.
- Add commands and options in a consistent way.  Otherwise people will have a
  hard time finding and remembering them.  Keep in mind that more commands and
  options will be added later.
- A feature that people do not know about is a useless feature.  Don't add
  obscure features, or at least add hints in documentation that they exist.
- Minimize using CTRL and other modifiers, they are more difficult to type.
- There are many first-time and inexperienced Vim users.  Make it easy for
  them to start using Vim and learn more over time.
- There is no limit to the features that can be added.  Selecting new features
  is one based on (1) what users ask for, (2) how much effort it takes to
  implement and (3) someone actually implementing it.


VIM IS... MULTI PLATFORM				*design-multi-platform*

Vim tries to help as many users on as many platforms as possible.
- Support many kinds of terminals.  The minimal demands are cursor positioning
  and clear-screen.  Commands should only use key strokes that most keyboards
  have.  Support all the keys on the keyboard for mapping.
- Support many platforms.  A condition is that there is someone willing to do
  Vim development on that platform, and it doesn't mean messing up the code.
- Support many compilers and libraries.  Not everybody is able or allowed to
  install another compiler or GUI library.
- People switch from one platform to another, and from GUI to terminal
  version.  Features should be present in all versions, or at least in as many
  as possible with a reasonable effort.  Try to avoid that users must switch
  between platforms to accomplish their work efficiently.
- That a feature is not possible on some platforms, or only possible on one
  platform, does not mean it cannot be implemented.  [This intentionally
  contradicts the previous item, these two must be balanced.]


VIM IS... WELL DOCUMENTED				*design-documented*

- A feature that isn't documented is a useless feature.  A patch for a new
  feature must include the documentation.
- Documentation should be comprehensive and understandable.  Using examples is
  recommended.
- Don't make the text unnecessarily long.  Less documentation means that an
  item is easier to find.


VIM IS... HIGH SPEED AND SMALL IN SIZE			*design-speed-size*

Using Vim must not be a big attack on system resources.  Keep it small and
fast.
- Computers are becoming faster and bigger each year.  Vim can grow too, but
  no faster than computers are growing.  Keep Vim usable on older systems.
- Many users start Vim from a shell very often.  Startup time must be short.
- Commands must work efficiently.  The time they consume must be as small as
  possible.  Useful commands may take longer.
- Don't forget that some people use Vim over a slow connection.  Minimize the
  communication overhead.
- Items that add considerably to the size and are not used by many people
  should be a feature that can be disabled.
- Vim is a component among other components.  Don't turn it into a massive
  application, but have it work well together with other programs.


VIM IS... MAINTAINABLE					*design-maintain*

- The source code should not become a mess.  It should be reliable code.
- Use the same layout in all files to make it easy to read |coding-style|.
- Use comments in a useful way!  Quoting the function name and argument names
  is NOT useful.  Do explain what they are for.
- Porting to another platform should be made easy, without having to change
  too much platform-independent code.
- Use the object-oriented spirit: Put data and code together.  Minimize the
  knowledge spread to other parts of the code.


VIM IS... FLEXIBLE					*design-flexible*

Vim should make it easy for users to work in their preferred styles rather
than coercing its users into particular patterns of work.  This can be for
items with a large impact (e.g., the 'compatible' option) or for details.  The
defaults are carefully chosen such that most users will enjoy using Vim as it
is.  Commands and options can be used to adjust Vim to the desire of the user
and its environment.


VIM IS... NOT						*design-not*

- Vim is not a shell or an Operating System.  You will not be able to run a
  shell inside Vim or use it to control a debugger.  This should work the
  other way around: Use Vim as a component from a shell or in an IDE.
  A satirical way to say this: "Unlike Emacs, Vim does not attempt to include
  everything but the kitchen sink, but some people say that you can clean one
  with it.  ;-)"
  To use Vim with gdb see: http://www.agide.org and http://clewn.sf.net.
- Vim is not a fancy GUI editor that tries to look nice at the cost of
  being less consistent over all platforms.  But functional GUI features are
  welcomed.

==============================================================================
2. Coding style						*coding-style*

These are the rules to use when making changes to the Vim source code.  Please
stick to these rules, to keep the sources readable and maintainable.

This list is not complete.  Look in the source code for more examples.


MAKING CHANGES						*style-changes*

The basic steps to make changes to the code:
1. Get the code from github.  That makes it easier to keep your changed
   version in sync with the main code base (it may be a while before your
   changes will be included).  You do need to spend some time learning git,
   it's not the most user friendly tool.
2. Adjust the documentation.  Doing this first gives you an impression of how
   your changes affect the user.
3. Make the source code changes.
4. Check ../doc/todo.txt if the change affects any listed item.
5. Make a patch with "git diff".  You can also create a pull request on
   github, but it's the diff that matters.
6. Make a note about what changed, preferably mentioning the problem and the
   solution.  Send an email to the |vim-dev| maillist with an explanation and
   include the diff. Or create a pull request on github.


C COMPILER						*style-compiler*

The minimal C compiler version supported is C89, also known as ANSI C.
Later standards don't add much and C89 is the widest supported.

One restriction that this implies: no // comments, only /* comments */.


USE OF COMMON FUNCTIONS					*style-functions*

Some functions that are common to use, have a special Vim version.  Always
consider using the Vim version, because they were introduced with a reason.

NORMAL NAME	VIM NAME	DIFFERENCE OF VIM VERSION
free()		vim_free()	Checks for freeing NULL
malloc()	alloc()		Checks for out of memory situation
malloc()	lalloc()	Like alloc(), but has long argument
strcpy()	STRCPY()	Includes cast to (char *), for char_u * args
strchr()	vim_strchr()	Accepts special characters
strrchr()	vim_strrchr()	Accepts special characters
isspace()	vim_isspace()	Can handle characters > 128
iswhite()	vim_iswhite()	Only TRUE for tab and space
memcpy()	mch_memmove()	Handles overlapped copies
bcopy()		mch_memmove()	Handles overlapped copies
memset()	vim_memset()	Uniform for all systems


NAMES							*style-names*

Function names can not be more than 31 characters long (because of VMS).

Don't use "delete" or "this" as a variable name, C++ doesn't like it.

Because of the requirement that Vim runs on as many systems as possible, we
need to avoid using names that are already defined by the system.  This is a
list of names that are known to cause trouble.  The name is given as a regexp
pattern.

is.*()		POSIX, ctype.h
to.*()		POSIX, ctype.h

d_.*		POSIX, dirent.h
l_.*		POSIX, fcntl.h
gr_.*		POSIX, grp.h
pw_.*		POSIX, pwd.h
sa_.*		POSIX, signal.h
mem.*		POSIX, string.h
str.*		POSIX, string.h
wcs.*		POSIX, string.h
st_.*		POSIX, stat.h
tms_.*		POSIX, times.h
tm_.*		POSIX, time.h
c_.*		POSIX, termios.h
MAX.*		POSIX, limits.h
__.*		POSIX, system
_[A-Z].*	POSIX, system
E[A-Z0-9]*	POSIX, errno.h

.*_t		POSIX, for typedefs.  Use .*_T instead.

wait		don't use as argument to a function, conflicts with types.h
index		shadows global declaration
time		shadows global declaration
new		C++ reserved keyword
try		Borland C++ doesn't like it to be used as a variable.

clear		Mac curses.h
echo		Mac curses.h
instr		Mac curses.h
meta		Mac curses.h
newwin		Mac curses.h
nl		Mac curses.h
overwrite	Mac curses.h
refresh		Mac curses.h
scroll		Mac curses.h
typeahead	Mac curses.h

basename()	GNU string function
dirname()	GNU string function
get_env_value()	Linux system function


VARIOUS							*style-various*

Typedef'ed names should end in "_T": >
    typedef int some_T;
Define'ed names should be uppercase: >
    #define SOME_THING
Features always start with "FEAT_": >
    #define FEAT_FOO

Don't use '\"', some compilers can't handle it.  '"' works fine.

Don't use:
    #if HAVE_SOME
Some compilers can't handle that and complain that "HAVE_SOME" is not defined.
Use
    #ifdef HAVE_SOME
or
    #if defined(HAVE_SOME)


STYLE							*style-examples*

General rule: One statement per line.

Wrong:	    if (cond) a = 1;

OK:	    if (cond)
		a = 1;

Wrong:	    while (cond);

OK:	    while (cond)
		;

Wrong:	    do a = 1; while (cond);

OK:	    do
		a = 1;
	    while (cond);

Wrong:	    if (cond) {
               cmd;
               cmd;
	    } else {
               cmd;
               cmd;
	    }

OK:	    if (cond)
            {
               cmd;
               cmd;
	    }
	    else
	    {
               cmd;
               cmd;
	    }

Use ANSI (new style) function declarations with the return type on a separate
indented line.

Wrong:	int function_name(int arg1, int arg2)

OK:	/*
	 * Explanation of what this function is used for.
	 *
	 * Return value explanation.
	 */
	    int
	function_name(
	    int		arg1,		/* short comment about arg1 */
	    int		arg2)		/* short comment about arg2 */
	{
	    int		local;		/* comment about local */

	    local = arg1 * arg2;



SPACES AND PUNCTUATION					*style-spaces*

No space between a function name and the bracket:

Wrong:  func (arg);
OK:	func(arg);

Do use a space after if, while, switch, etc.

Wrong:	if(arg)		for(;;)
OK:	if (arg)	for (;;)

Use a space after a comma and semicolon:

Wrong:  func(arg1,arg2);	for (i = 0;i < 2;++i)
OK:	func(arg1, arg2);	for (i = 0; i < 2; ++i)

Use a space before and after '=', '+', '/', etc.

Wrong:	var=a*5;
OK:	var = a * 5;

In general: Use empty lines to group lines of code together.  Put a comment
just above the group of lines.  This makes it easier to quickly see what is
being done.

OK:	/* Prepare for building the table. */
	get_first_item();
	table_idx = 0;

	/* Build the table */
	while (has_item())
	    table[table_idx++] = next_item();

	/* Finish up. */
	cleanup_items();
	generate_hash(table);

==============================================================================
3. Design decisions					*design-decisions*

Folding

Several forms of folding should be possible for the same buffer.  For example,
have one window that shows the text with function bodies folded, another
window that shows a function body.

Folding is a way to display the text.  It should not change the text itself.
Therefore the folding has been implemented as a filter between the text stored
in a buffer (buffer lines) and the text displayed in a window (logical lines).


Naming the window

The word "window" is commonly used for several things: A window on the screen,
the xterm window, a window inside Vim to view a buffer.
To avoid confusion, other items that are sometimes called window have been
given another name.  Here is an overview of the related items:

screen		The whole display.  For the GUI it's something like 1024x768
		pixels.  The Vim shell can use the whole screen or part of it.
shell		The Vim application.  This can cover the whole screen (e.g.,
		when running in a console) or part of it (xterm or GUI).
window		View on a buffer.  There can be several windows in Vim,
		together with the command line, menubar, toolbar, etc. they
		fit in the shell.


Spell checking						*develop-spell*

When spell checking was going to be added to Vim a survey was done over the
available spell checking libraries and programs.  Unfortunately, the result
was that none of them provided sufficient capabilities to be used as the spell
checking engine in Vim, for various reasons:

- Missing support for multi-byte encodings.  At least UTF-8 must be supported,
  so that more than one language can be used in the same file.
  Doing on-the-fly conversion is not always possible (would require iconv
  support).
- For the programs and libraries: Using them as-is would require installing
  them separately from Vim.  That's mostly not impossible, but a drawback.
- Performance: A few tests showed that it's possible to check spelling on the
  fly (while redrawing), just like syntax highlighting.  But the mechanisms
  used by other code are much slower.  Myspell uses a hashtable, for example.
  The affix compression that most spell checkers use makes it slower too.
- For using an external program like aspell a communication mechanism would
  have to be setup.  That's complicated to do in a portable way (Unix-only
  would be relatively simple, but that's not good enough).  And performance
  will become a problem (lots of process switching involved).
- Missing support for words with non-word characters, such as "Etten-Leur" and
  "et al.", would require marking the pieces of them OK, lowering the
  reliability.
- Missing support for regions or dialects.  Makes it difficult to accept
  all English words and highlight non-Canadian words differently.
- Missing support for rare words.  Many words are correct but hardly ever used
  and could be a misspelled often-used word.
- For making suggestions the speed is less important and requiring to install
  another program or library would be acceptable.  But the word lists probably
  differ, the suggestions may be wrong words.


Spelling suggestions				*develop-spell-suggestions*

For making suggestions there are two basic mechanisms:
1. Try changing the bad word a little bit and check for a match with a good
   word.  Or go through the list of good words, change them a little bit and
   check for a match with the bad word.  The changes are deleting a character,
   inserting a character, swapping two characters, etc.
2. Perform soundfolding on both the bad word and the good words and then find
   matches, possibly with a few changes like with the first mechanism.

The first is good for finding typing mistakes.  After experimenting with
hashtables and looking at solutions from other spell checkers the conclusion
was that a trie (a kind of tree structure) is ideal for this.  Both for
reducing memory use and being able to try sensible changes.  For example, when
inserting a character only characters that lead to good words need to be
tried.  Other mechanisms (with hashtables) need to try all possible letters at
every position in the word.  Also, a hashtable has the requirement that word
boundaries are identified separately, while a trie does not require this.
That makes the mechanism a lot simpler.

Soundfolding is useful when someone knows how the words sounds but doesn't
know how it is spelled.  For example, the word "dictionary" might be written
as "daktonerie".  The number of changes that the first method would need to
try is very big, it's hard to find the good word that way.  After soundfolding
the words become "tktnr" and "tkxnry", these differ by only two letters.

To find words by their soundfolded equivalent (soundalike word) we need a list
of all soundfolded words.  A few experiments have been done to find out what
the best method is.  Alternatives:
1. Do the sound folding on the fly when looking for suggestions.  This means
   walking through the trie of good words, soundfolding each word and
   checking how different it is from the bad word.  This is very efficient for
   memory use, but takes a long time.  On a fast PC it takes a couple of
   seconds for English, which can be acceptable for interactive use.  But for
   some languages it takes more than ten seconds (e.g., German, Catalan),
   which is unacceptable slow.  For batch processing (automatic corrections)
   it's too slow for all languages.
2. Use a trie for the soundfolded words, so that searching can be done just
   like how it works without soundfolding.  This requires remembering a list
   of good words for each soundfolded word.  This makes finding matches very
   fast but requires quite a lot of memory, in the order of 1 to 10 Mbyte.
   For some languages more than the original word list.
3. Like the second alternative, but reduce the amount of memory by using affix
   compression and store only the soundfolded basic word.  This is what Aspell
   does.  Disadvantage is that affixes need to be stripped from the bad word
   before soundfolding it, which means that mistakes at the start and/or end
   of the word will cause the mechanism to fail.  Also, this becomes slow when
   the bad word is quite different from the good word.

The choice made is to use the second mechanism and use a separate file.  This
way a user with sufficient memory can get very good suggestions while a user
who is short of memory or just wants the spell checking and no suggestions
doesn't use so much memory.


Word frequency

For sorting suggestions it helps to know which words are common.  In theory we
could store a word frequency with the word in the dictionary.  However, this
requires storing a count per word.  That degrades word tree compression a lot.
And maintaining the word frequency for all languages will be a heavy task.
Also, it would be nice to prefer words that are already in the text.  This way
the words that appear in the specific text are preferred for suggestions.

What has been implemented is to count words that have been seen during
displaying.  A hashtable is used to quickly find the word count.  The count is
initialized from words listed in COMMON items in the affix file, so that it
also works when starting a new file.

This isn't ideal, because the longer Vim is running the higher the counts
become.  But in practice it is a noticeable improvement over not using the word
count.

==============================================================================
4. Assumptions						*design-assumptions*

Size of variables:
char	    8 bit signed
char_u	    8 bit unsigned
int	    32 or 64 bit signed (16 might be possible with limited features)
unsigned    32 or 64 bit unsigned (16 as with ints)
long	    32 or 64 bit signed, can hold a pointer

Note that some compilers cannot handle long lines or strings.  The C89
standard specifies a limit of 509 characters.

				*diff* *vimdiff* *gvimdiff* *diff-mode*
This file describes the |+diff| feature: Showing differences between two to
eight versions of the same file.

The basics are explained in section |08.7| of the user manual.

1. Starting diff mode		|vimdiff|
2. Viewing diffs		|view-diffs|
3. Jumping to diffs		|jumpto-diffs|
4. Copying diffs		|copy-diffs|
5. Diff options			|diff-options|

{not in Vi}

==============================================================================
1. Starting diff mode

The easiest way to start editing in diff mode is with the "vimdiff" command.
This starts Vim as usual, and additionally sets up for viewing the differences
between the arguments. >

	vimdiff file1 file2 [file3 [file4]]

This is equivalent to: >

	vim -d file1 file2 [file3 [file4]]

You may also use "gvimdiff" or "vim -d -g".  The GUI is started then.
You may also use "viewdiff" or "gviewdiff".  Vim starts in readonly mode then.
"r" may be prepended for restricted mode (see |-Z|).

The second and following arguments may also be a directory name.  Vim will
then append the file name of the first argument to the directory name to find
the file.

This only works when a standard "diff" command is available.  See 'diffexpr'.

Diffs are local to the current tab page |tab-page|.  You can't see diffs with
a window in another tab page.  This does make it possible to have several
diffs at the same time, each in their own tab page.

What happens is that Vim opens a window for each of the files.  This is like
using the |-O| argument.  This uses vertical splits.  If you prefer horizontal
splits add the |-o| argument: >

	vimdiff -o file1 file2 [file3 [file4]]

If you always prefer horizontal splits include "horizontal" in 'diffopt'.

In each of the edited files these options are set:

	'diff'		on
	'scrollbind'	on
	'cursorbind'	on
	'scrollopt'	includes "hor"
	'wrap'		off
	'foldmethod'	"diff"
	'foldcolumn'	value from 'diffopt', default is 2

These options are set local to the window.  When editing another file they are
reset to the global value.
The options can still be overruled from a modeline when re-editing the file.
However, 'foldmethod' and 'wrap' won't be set from a modeline when 'diff' is
set.

The differences shown are actually the differences in the buffer.  Thus if you
make changes after loading a file, these will be included in the displayed
diffs.  You might have to do ":diffupdate" now and then, not all changes are
immediately taken into account.

In your .vimrc file you could do something special when Vim was started in
diff mode.  You could use a construct like this: >

	if &diff
	   setup for diff mode
	else
	   setup for non-diff mode
	endif

While already in Vim you can start diff mode in three ways.

							*E98*
:diffs[plit] {filename}					*:diffs* *:diffsplit*
		Open a new window on the file {filename}.  The options are set
		as for "vimdiff" for the current and the newly opened window.
		Also see 'diffexpr'.

							*:difft* *:diffthis*
:difft[his]	Make the current window part of the diff windows.  This sets
		the options like for "vimdiff".

:diffp[atch] {patchfile}			 *E816* *:diffp* *:diffpatch*
		Use the current buffer, patch it with the diff found in
		{patchfile} and open a buffer on the result.  The options are
		set as for "vimdiff".
		{patchfile} can be in any format that the "patch" program
		understands or 'patchexpr' can handle.
		Note that {patchfile} should only contain a diff for one file,
		the current file.  If {patchfile} contains diffs for other
		files as well, the results are unpredictable.  Vim changes
		directory to /tmp to avoid files in the current directory
		accidentally being patched.  But it may still result in
		various ".rej" files to be created.  And when absolute path
		names are present these files may get patched anyway.

To make these commands use a vertical split, prepend |:vertical|.  Examples: >

	:vert diffsplit main.c~
	:vert diffpatch /tmp/diff

If you always prefer a vertical split include "vertical" in 'diffopt'.

							*E96*
There can be up to eight buffers with 'diff' set.

Since the option values are remembered with the buffer, you can edit another
file for a moment and come back to the same file and be in diff mode again.

							*:diffo* *:diffoff*
:diffo[ff]	Switch off diff mode for the current window.  Resets related
		options also when 'diff' was not set.

:diffo[ff]!	Switch off diff mode for the current window and in all windows
		in the current tab page where 'diff' is set.  Resetting
		related options only happens in a window that has 'diff' set,
		if the current window does not have 'diff' set then no options
		in it are changed.

The `:diffoff` command resets the relevant options to the values they had when
using `:diffsplit`, `:diffpatch` , `:diffthis`. or starting Vim in diff mode.
When using `:diffoff` twice the last saved values are restored.
Otherwise they are set to their default value:

	'diff'		off
	'scrollbind'	off
	'cursorbind'	off
	'scrollopt'	without "hor"
	'wrap'		on
	'foldmethod'	"manual"
	'foldcolumn'	0

==============================================================================
2. Viewing diffs						*view-diffs*

The effect is that the diff windows show the same text, with the differences
highlighted.  When scrolling the text, the 'scrollbind' option will make the
text in other windows to be scrolled as well.  With vertical splits the text
should be aligned properly.

The alignment of text will go wrong when:
- 'wrap' is on, some lines will be wrapped and occupy two or more screen
  lines
- folds are open in one window but not another
- 'scrollbind' is off
- changes have been made to the text
- "filler" is not present in 'diffopt', deleted/inserted lines makes the
  alignment go wrong

All the buffers edited in a window where the 'diff' option is set will join in
the diff.  This is also possible for hidden buffers.  They must have been
edited in a window first for this to be possible.

					*:DiffOrig* *diff-original-file*
Since 'diff' is a window-local option, it's possible to view the same buffer
in diff mode in one window and "normal" in another window.  It is also
possible to view the changes you have made to a buffer since the file was
loaded.  Since Vim doesn't allow having two buffers for the same file, you
need another buffer.  This command is useful: >
	 command DiffOrig vert new | set bt=nofile | r ++edit # | 0d_
	 	\ | diffthis | wincmd p | diffthis
(this is in |vimrc_example.vim|).  Use ":DiffOrig" to see the differences
between the current buffer and the file it was loaded from.

A buffer that is unloaded cannot be used for the diff.  But it does work for
hidden buffers.  You can use ":hide" to close a window without unloading the
buffer.  If you don't want a buffer to remain used for the diff do ":set
nodiff" before hiding it.

							*:dif* *:diffupdate*
:dif[fupdate][!]		Update the diff highlighting and folds.

Vim attempts to keep the differences updated when you make changes to the
text.  This mostly takes care of inserted and deleted lines.  Changes within a
line and more complicated changes do not cause the differences to be updated.
To force the differences to be updated use: >

	:diffupdate

If the ! is included Vim will check if the file was changed externally and
needs to be reloaded.  It will prompt for each changed file, like `:checktime`
was used.

Vim will show filler lines for lines that are missing in one window but are
present in another.  These lines were inserted in another file or deleted in
this file.  Removing "filler" from the 'diffopt' option will make Vim not
display these filler lines.


Folds are used to hide the text that wasn't changed.  See |folding| for all
the commands that can be used with folds.

The context of lines above a difference that are not included in the fold can
be set with the 'diffopt' option.  For example, to set the context to three
lines: >

	:set diffopt=filler,context:3


The diffs are highlighted with these groups:

|hl-DiffAdd|	DiffAdd		Added (inserted) lines.  These lines exist in
				this buffer but not in another.
|hl-DiffChange|	DiffChange	Changed lines.
|hl-DiffText|	DiffText	Changed text inside a Changed line.  Vim
				finds the first character that is different,
				and the last character that is different
				(searching from the end of the line).  The
				text in between is highlighted.  This means
				that parts in the middle that are still the
				same are highlighted anyway.  Only "iwhite" of
				'diffopt' is used here.
|hl-DiffDelete|	DiffDelete	Deleted lines.  Also called filler lines,
				because they don't really exist in this
				buffer.

==============================================================================
3. Jumping to diffs					*jumpto-diffs*

Two commands can be used to jump to diffs:
								*[c*
	[c		Jump backwards to the previous start of a change.
			When a count is used, do it that many times.
								*]c*
	]c		Jump forwards to the next start of a change.
			When a count is used, do it that many times.

It is an error if there is no change for the cursor to move to.

==============================================================================
4. Diff copying			*copy-diffs* *E99* *E100* *E101* *E102* *E103*
								*merge*
There are two commands to copy text from one buffer to another.  The result is
that the buffers will be equal within the specified range.

							*:diffg* *:diffget*
:[range]diffg[et] [bufspec]
		Modify the current buffer to undo difference with another
		buffer.  If [bufspec] is given, that buffer is used.  If
		[bufspec] refers to the current buffer then nothing happens.
		Otherwise this only works if there is one other buffer in diff
		mode.
		See below for [range].

						*:diffpu* *:diffput* *E793*
:[range]diffpu[t] [bufspec]
		Modify another buffer to undo difference with the current
		buffer.  Just like ":diffget" but the other buffer is modified
		instead of the current one.
		When [bufspec] is omitted and there is more than one other
		buffer in diff mode where 'modifiable' is set this fails.
		See below for [range].

							*do*
[count]do	Same as ":diffget" without range.  The "o" stands for "obtain"
		("dg" can't be used, it could be the start of "dgg"!). Note:
		this doesn't work in Visual mode.
		If you give a [count], it is used as the [bufspec] argument
		for ":diffget".

							*dp*
[count]dp	Same as ":diffput" without range.  Note: this doesn't work in
		Visual mode.
		If you give a [count], it is used as the [bufspec] argument
		for ":diffput".


When no [range] is given, the diff at the cursor position or just above it is
affected.  When [range] is used, Vim tries to only put or get the specified
lines.  When there are deleted lines, this may not always be possible.

There can be deleted lines below the last line of the buffer.  When the cursor
is on the last line in the buffer and there is no diff above this line, the
":diffget" and "do" commands will obtain lines from the other buffer.

To be able to get those lines from another buffer in a [range] it's allowed to
use the last line number plus one.  This command gets all diffs from the other
buffer: >

	:1,$+1diffget

Note that deleted lines are displayed, but not counted as text lines.  You
can't move the cursor into them.  To fill the deleted lines with the lines
from another buffer use ":diffget" on the line below them.
								*E787*
When the buffer that is about to be modified is read-only and the autocommand
that is triggered by |FileChangedRO| changes buffers the command will fail.
The autocommand must not change buffers.

The [bufspec] argument above can be a buffer number, a pattern for a buffer
name or a part of a buffer name.  Examples:

	:diffget		Use the other buffer which is in diff mode
	:diffget 3		Use buffer 3
	:diffget v2		Use the buffer which matches "v2" and is in
				diff mode (e.g., "file.c.v2")

==============================================================================
5. Diff options						*diff-options*

Also see |'diffopt'| and the "diff" item of |'fillchars'|.

					    *diff-slow* *diff_translations*
For very long lines, the diff syntax highlighting might be slow, especially
since it tries to match all different kind of localisations. To disable
localisations and speed up the syntax highlighting, set the global variable
g:diff_translations to zero: >

    let g:diff_translations = 0
<
After setting this variable, Reload the syntax script: >

    set syntax=diff
<


FINDING THE DIFFERENCES					*diff-diffexpr*

The 'diffexpr' option can be set to use something else than the standard
"diff" program to compare two files and find the differences.

When 'diffexpr' is empty, Vim uses this command to find the differences
between file1 and file2: >

	diff file1 file2 > outfile

The ">" is replaced with the value of 'shellredir'.

The output of "diff" must be a normal "ed" style diff.  Do NOT use a context
diff.  This example explains the format that Vim expects: >

	1a2
	> bbb
	4d4
	< 111
	7c7
	< GGG
	---
	> ggg

The "1a2" item appends the line "bbb".
The "4d4" item deletes the line "111".
The "7c7" item replaces the line "GGG" with "ggg".

When 'diffexpr' is not empty, Vim evaluates it to obtain a diff file in the
format mentioned.  These variables are set to the file names used:

	v:fname_in		original file
	v:fname_new		new version of the same file
	v:fname_out		resulting diff file

Additionally, 'diffexpr' should take care of "icase" and "iwhite" in the
'diffopt' option.  'diffexpr' cannot change the value of 'lines' and
'columns'.

Example (this does almost the same as 'diffexpr' being empty): >

	set diffexpr=MyDiff()
	function MyDiff()
	   let opt = ""
	   if &diffopt =~ "icase"
	     let opt = opt . "-i "
	   endif
	   if &diffopt =~ "iwhite"
	     let opt = opt . "-b "
	   endif
	   silent execute "!diff -a --binary " . opt . v:fname_in . " " . v:fname_new .
		\  " > " . v:fname_out
	endfunction

The "-a" argument is used to force comparing the files as text, comparing as
binaries isn't useful.  The "--binary" argument makes the files read in binary
mode, so that a CTRL-Z doesn't end the text on DOS.

						*E810* *E97*
Vim will do a test if the diff output looks alright.  If it doesn't, you will
get an error message.  Possible causes:
-  The "diff" program cannot be executed.
-  The "diff" program doesn't produce normal "ed" style diffs (see above).
-  The 'shell' and associated options are not set correctly.  Try if filtering
   works with a command like ":!sort".
-  You are using 'diffexpr' and it doesn't work.
If it's not clear what the problem is set the 'verbose' option to one or more
to see more messages.

The self-installing Vim for MS-Windows includes a diff program.  If you don't
have it you might want to download a diff.exe.  For example from
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm.


USING PATCHES					*diff-patchexpr*

The 'patchexpr' option can be set to use something else than the standard
"patch" program.

When 'patchexpr' is empty, Vim will call the "patch" program like this: >

	patch -o outfile origfile < patchfile

This should work fine with most versions of the "patch" program.  Note that a
CR in the middle of a line may cause problems, it is seen as a line break.

If the default doesn't work for you, set the 'patchexpr' to an expression that
will have the same effect.  These variables are set to the file names used:

	v:fname_in		original file
	v:fname_diff		patch file
	v:fname_out		resulting patched file

Example (this does the same as 'patchexpr' being empty): >

	set patchexpr=MyPatch()
	function MyPatch()
	   :call system("patch -o " . v:fname_out . " " . v:fname_in .
	   \  " < " . v:fname_diff)
	endfunction

Make sure that using the "patch" program doesn't have unwanted side effects.
For example, watch out for additionally generated files, which should be
deleted.  It should just patch the file and nothing else.
   Vim will change directory to "/tmp" or another temp directory before
evaluating 'patchexpr'.  This hopefully avoids that files in the current
directory are accidentally patched.  Vim will also delete files starting with
v:fname_in and ending in ".rej" and ".orig".

Digraphs					*digraph* *digraphs* *Digraphs*

Digraphs are used to enter characters that normally cannot be entered by
an ordinary keyboard.  These are mostly printable non-ASCII characters.  The
digraphs are easier to remember than the decimal number that can be entered
with CTRL-V (see |i_CTRL-V|).

There is a brief introduction on digraphs in the user manual: |24.9|
An alternative is using the 'keymap' option.

1. Defining digraphs	|digraphs-define|
2. Using digraphs	|digraphs-use|
3. Default digraphs	|digraphs-default|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Defining digraphs					*digraphs-define*

						*:dig* *:digraphs*
:dig[raphs]		show currently defined digraphs.
							*E104* *E39*
:dig[raphs] {char1}{char2} {number} ...
			Add digraph {char1}{char2} to the list.  {number} is
			the decimal representation of the character.  Normally
			it is the Unicode character, see |digraph-encoding|.
			Example: >
	:digr e: 235 a: 228
<			Avoid defining a digraph with '_' (underscore) as the
			first character, it has a special meaning in the
			future.

Vim is normally compiled with the |+digraphs| feature.  If the feature is
disabled, the ":digraph" command will display an error message.

Example of the output of ":digraphs": >
 TH Þ  222  ss ß  223  a! à  224  a' á  225  a> â  226  a? ã  227  a: ä  228

The first two characters in each column are the characters you have to type to
enter the digraph.

In the middle of each column is the resulting character.  This may be mangled
if you look at it on a system that does not support digraphs or if you print
this file.

							*digraph-encoding*
The decimal number normally is the Unicode number of the character.  Note that
the meaning doesn't change when 'encoding' changes.  The character will be
converted from Unicode to 'encoding' when needed.  This does require the
conversion to be available, it might fail.  For the NUL character you will see
"10".  That's because NUL characters are internally represented with a NL
character.  When you write the file it will become a NUL character.

When Vim was compiled without the |+multi_byte| feature, you need to specify
the character in the encoding given with 'encoding'.  You might want to use
something like this: >

	if has("multi_byte")
		digraph oe 339
	elseif &encoding == "iso-8859-15"
		digraph oe 189
	endif

This defines the "oe" digraph for a character that is number 339 in Unicode
and 189 in latin9 (iso-8859-15).

==============================================================================
2. Using digraphs					*digraphs-use*

There are two methods to enter digraphs:			*i_digraph*
	CTRL-K {char1} {char2}		or
	{char1} <BS> {char2}
The first is always available; the second only when the 'digraph' option is
set.

If a digraph with {char1}{char2} does not exist, Vim searches for a digraph
{char2}{char1}.  This helps when you don't remember which character comes
first.

Note that when you enter CTRL-K {char1}, where {char1} is a special key, Vim
enters the code for that special key.  This is not a digraph.

Once you have entered the digraph, Vim treats the character like a normal
character that occupies only one character in the file and on the screen.
Example: >
	'B' <BS> 'B'	will enter the broken '|' character (166)
	'a' <BS> '>'	will enter an 'a' with a circumflex (226)
	CTRL-K '-' '-'	will enter a soft hyphen (173)

The current digraphs are listed with the ":digraphs" command.  Some of the
default ones are listed below |digraph-table|.

For CTRL-K, there is one general digraph: CTRL-K <Space> {char} will enter
{char} with the highest bit set.  You can use this to enter meta-characters.

The <Esc> character cannot be part of a digraph.  When hitting <Esc>, Vim
stops digraph entry and ends Insert mode or Command-line mode, just like
hitting an <Esc> out of digraph context.  Use CTRL-V 155 to enter meta-ESC
(CSI).

If you accidentally typed an 'a' that should be an 'e', you will type 'a' <BS>
'e'.  But that is a digraph, so you will not get what you want.  To correct
this, you will have to type <BS> e again.  To avoid this don't set the
'digraph' option and use CTRL-K to enter digraphs.

You may have problems using Vim with characters which have a value above 128.
For example: You insert ue (u-umlaut) and the editor echoes \334 in Insert
mode.  After leaving the Insert mode everything is fine.  Note that fmt
removes all characters with a value above 128 from the text being formatted.
On some Unix systems this means you have to define the environment-variable
LC_CTYPE.  If you are using csh, then put the following line in your .cshrc: >
	setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1

==============================================================================
3. Default digraphs					*digraphs-default*

Vim comes with a set of default digraphs.  Check the output of ":digraphs" to
see them.

On most systems Vim uses the same digraphs.  They work for the Unicode and
ISO-8859-1 character sets.  These default digraphs are taken from the RFC1345
mnemonics.  To make it easy to remember the mnemonic, the second character has
a standard meaning:

	char name		char	meaning ~
	Exclamation mark	!	Grave
	Apostrophe		'	Acute accent
	Greater-Than sign	>	Circumflex accent
	Question mark		?	Tilde
	Hyphen-Minus		-	Macron
	Left parenthesis	(	Breve
	Full stop		.	Dot above
	Colon			:	Diaeresis
	Comma			,	Cedilla
	Underline		_	Underline
	Solidus			/	Stroke
	Quotation mark		"	Double acute accent
	Semicolon		;	Ogonek
	Less-Than sign		<	Caron
	Zero			0	Ring above
	Two			2	Hook
	Nine			9	Horn

	Equals			=	Cyrillic (= used as second char)
	Asterisk		*	Greek
	Percent sign		%	Greek/Cyrillic special
	Plus			+	smalls: Arabic, capitals: Hebrew
	Three			3	some Latin/Greek/Cyrillic letters
	Four			4	Bopomofo
	Five			5	Hiragana
	Six			6	Katakana

Example: a: is ä  and o: is ö

These are the RFC1345 digraphs for the one-byte characters.  See the output of
":digraphs" for the others.  The characters above 255 are only available when
Vim was compiled with the |+multi_byte| feature.

EURO

Exception: RFC1345 doesn't specify the euro sign.  In Vim the digraph =e was
added for this.  Note the difference between latin1, where the digraph Cu is
used for the currency sign, and latin9 (iso-8859-15), where the digraph =e is
used for the euro sign, while both of them are the character 164, 0xa4.  For
compatibility with zsh Eu can also be used for the euro sign.

ROUBLE

The rouble sign was added in 2014 as 0x20bd.  Vim supports the digraphs =R and
=P for this.  Note that R= and P= are other characters.

Right to Left and Farsi Mapping for Vim		*farsi* *Farsi*

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

						*E27*
In order to use right-to-left and Farsi mapping support, it is necessary to
compile Vim with the |+farsi| feature.

These functions have been made by Mortaza G. Shiran <shiran@jps.net>


Introduction
------------
In right-to-left oriented files the characters appear on the screen from right
to left.  This kind of file is most useful when writing Farsi documents,
composing faxes or writing Farsi memos.

The commands, prompts and help files are not in Farsi, therefore the user
interface remains the standard Vi interface.


Highlights
----------
o  Editing left-to-right files as in the original Vim, no change.

o  Viewing and editing files in right-to-left windows.   File orientation is
   per window, so it is possible to view the same file in right-to-left and
   left-to-right modes, simultaneously.

o  Compatibility to the original Vim.   Almost all features work in
   right-to-left mode (see bugs below).

o  Changing keyboard mapping and reverse insert modes using a single
   command.

o  Backing from reverse insert mode to the correct place in the file
   (if possible).

o  While in Farsi mode, numbers are entered from left to right.  Upon entering
   a none number character, that character will be inserted just into the
   left of the last number.

o  No special terminal with right-to-left capabilities is required.  The
   right-to-left changes are completely hardware independent.  Only
   Farsi font is necessary.

o  Farsi keymapping on the command line in reverse insert mode.

o  Toggling between left-to-right and right-to-left via F8 function key.

o  Toggling between Farsi ISIR-3342 standard encoding and Vim Farsi via F9
   function key.  Since this makes sense only for the text written in
   right-to-left mode, this function is also supported only in right-to-left
   mode.

Farsi Fonts					*farsi-fonts*
-----------

The following files are found in the subdirectories of the '$VIM/farsi/fonts'
directory:

   +  far-a01.pcf    X Windows fonts for Unix including Linux systems
   +  far-a01.bf     X Windows fonts for SunOS
   +  far-a01.f16    a screen fonts for Unix including Linux systems
   +  far-a01.fon    a monospaced fonts for Windows NT/95/98
   +  far-a01.com    a screen fonts for DOS


Font Installation
-----------------

o  Installation of fonts for MS Window systems (NT/95/98)

   From 'Control Panel' folder, start the 'Fonts' program.  Then from 'file'
   menu item select 'Install New Fonts ...'.  Browse and select the
   'far-a01.fon', then follow the installation guide.
   NOTE: several people have reported that this does not work.  The solution
   is unknown.

o  Installation of fonts for X Window systems (Unix/Linux)

   Depending on your system, copy far-a01.pcf.Z or far-a01.pcf.gz into a
   directory of your choice.  Change to the directory containing the Farsi
   fonts and execute the following commands:

   >  mkfontdir
   >  xset +fp path_name_of_farsi_fonts_directory

o  Installation of fonts for X Window systems (SunOS)

   Copy far-a01.bf font into a directory of your choice.
   Change to the directory containing the far-a01.fb fonts and
   execute the following commands:

   >  fldfamily
   >  xset +fp path_name_of_fonts_directory

o  Installation of ASCII screen fonts (Unix/Linux)

   For Linux system, copy the far-a01.f16 fonts into /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts
   directory and execute the setfont program as "setfont far-a01.f16".  For
   other systems (e.g. SCO Unix), please refer to the fonts installation
   section of your system administration manuals.

o  Installation of ASCII screen fonts (DOS)

   After system power on, prior to the first use of Vim, upload the Farsi
   fonts by executing the far-a01.com font uploading program.


Usage
-----
Prior to starting Vim, the environment in which Vim can run in Farsi mode,
must be set.  In addition to installation of Farsi fonts, following points
refer to some of the system environments, which you may need to set:
Key code mapping, loading graphic card in ASCII screen mode, setting the IO
driver in 8 bit clean mode ... .

o  Setting the Farsi fonts

   +  For Vim GUI set the 'guifont' to far-a01.  This is done by entering
      ':set guifont=far-a01' in the Vim window.

      You can have 'guifont' set to far-a01 by Vim during the Vim startup
      by appending the ':set guifont=far-a01' into your .vimrc file
      (in case of NT/95/98 platforms _vimrc).

      Under the X Window environment, you can also start Vim with the
      '-fn far-a01' option.

   +  For Vim within a xterm, start a xterm with the Farsi fonts (e.g.
      kterm -fn far-a01).  Then start Vim inside the kterm.

   +  For Vim under DOS, prior to the first usage of Vim, upload the Farsi
      fonts by executing the far-a01.com fonts uploading program.

o  Farsi Keymapping Activation

   To activate the Farsi keymapping, set either 'altkeymap' or 'fkmap'.
   This is done by entering ':set akm' or ':set fk' in the Vim window.
   You can have 'altkeymap' or 'fkmap' set as default by appending ':set akm'
   or ':set fk' in your .vimrc file or _vimrc in case of NT/95/98 platforms.

   To turn off the Farsi keymapping as a default second language keymapping,
   reset the 'altkeymap' by entering ':set noakm'.

o  right-to-left Farsi Mode

   By default Vim starts in Left-to-right mode.  Following are ways to change
   the window orientation:

   + Start Vim with the -F option (e.g. vim -F ...).

   + Use the F8 function key to toggle between left-to-right and right-to-left.

   + While in Left-to-right mode, enter 'set rl' in the command line ('rl' is
     the abbreviation for rightleft).

   + Put the 'set rl' line in your '.vimrc' file to start Vim in
     right-to-left mode permanently.

Encoding
--------

The letter encoding used is the Vim extended ISIR-3342 standard with a built
in function to convert between Vim extended ISIR-3342 and ISIR-3342 standard.

For document portability reasons, the letter encoding is kept the same across
different platforms (i.e. UNIX's, NT/95/98, MS DOS, ...).


o  Keyboard

   +  CTRL-_ in insert/replace modes toggles between Farsi(akm)/Latin
      mode as follows:

   +  CTRL-_ moves the cursor to the end of the typed text in edit mode.

   +  CTRL-_ in command mode only toggles keyboard mapping between Farsi(akm)/
      Latin.  The Farsi text is then entered in reverse insert mode.

   +  F8 - Toggles between left-to-right and right-to-left.

   +  F9 - Toggles the encoding between ISIR-3342 standard and Vim extended
      ISIR-3342 (supported only in right-to-left mode).

   +  Keyboard mapping is based on the Iranian ISIRI-2901 standard.
      Following table shows the keyboard mapping while Farsi(akm) mode set:

	-------------------------------------
	`  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  -  =
	                        
	-------------------------------------
	~  !  @  #  $  %  ^  &  *  (  )  _  +
	~                        
	-------------------------------------
	q  w  e  r  t  z  u  i  o  p  [  ]
	                      
	-------------------------------------
	Q  W  E  R  T  Z  U  I  O  P  {  }
	                [  ]  {  }
	-------------------------------------
	a  s  d  f  g  h  j  k  l  ;  '  \
	                      
	-------------------------------------
	A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K  L  :  "  |
	                     
	-------------------------------------
	<  y  x  c  v  b  n  m  ,  .  /
	                    
	-------------------------------------
	>  Y  X  C  V  B  N  M  <  >  ?
	                    
	-------------------------------------

Note:
	  stands for Farsi PSP (break without space)

	  stands for Farsi PCN (for HAMZE attribute)

Restrictions
------------

o  In insert/replace mode and fkmap (Farsi mode) set, CTRL-B is not
   supported.

o  If you change the character mapping between Latin/Farsi, the redo buffer
   will be reset (emptied).  That is, redo is valid and will function (using
   '.') only within the mode you are in.

o  While numbers are entered in Farsi mode, the redo buffer will be reset
   (emptied).  That is, you cannot redo the last changes (using '.') after
   entering numbers.

o  While in left-to-right mode and Farsi mode set, CTRL-R is not supported.

o  While in right-to-left mode, the search on 'Latin' pattern does not work,
   except if you enter the Latin search pattern in reverse.

o  In command mode there is no support for entering numbers from left
   to right and also for the sake of flexibility the keymapping logic is
   restricted.

o  Under the X Window environment, if you want to run Vim within a xterm
   terminal emulator and Farsi mode set, you need to have an ANSI compatible
   xterm terminal emulator.  This is because the letter codes above 128 decimal
   have certain meanings in the standard xterm terminal emulator.

   Note: Under X Window environment, Vim GUI works fine in Farsi mode.
	 This eliminates the need of any xterm terminal emulator.


Bugs
----
While in insert/replace and Farsi mode set, if you repeatedly change the
cursor position (via cursor movement) and enter new text and then try to undo
the last change, the undo will lag one change behind.  But as you continue to
undo, you will reach the original line of text.  You can also use U to undo all
changes made in the current line.

Filetypes						*filetype* *file-type*

1. Filetypes					|filetypes|
2. Filetype plugin				|filetype-plugins|
3. Docs for the default filetype plugins.	|ftplugin-docs|

Also see |autocmd.txt|.

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Filetypes					*filetypes* *file-types*

Vim can detect the type of file that is edited.  This is done by checking the
file name and sometimes by inspecting the contents of the file for specific
text.

							*:filetype* *:filet*
To enable file type detection, use this command in your vimrc: >
	:filetype on
Each time a new or existing file is edited, Vim will try to recognize the type
of the file and set the 'filetype' option.  This will trigger the FileType
event, which can be used to set the syntax highlighting, set options, etc.

NOTE: Filetypes and 'compatible' don't work together well, since being Vi
compatible means options are global.  Resetting 'compatible' is recommended,
if you didn't do that already.

Detail: The ":filetype on" command will load one of these files:
		Amiga	    $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
		Mac	    $VIMRUNTIME:filetype.vim
		MS-DOS	    $VIMRUNTIME\filetype.vim
		RiscOS	    Vim:Filetype
		Unix	    $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
		VMS	    $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
	This file is a Vim script that defines autocommands for the
	BufNewFile and BufRead events.  If the file type is not found by the
	name, the file $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim is used to detect it from the
	contents of the file.
	When the GUI is running or will start soon, the menu.vim script is
	also sourced.  See |'go-M'| about avoiding that.

To add your own file types, see |new-filetype| below.  To search for help on a
filetype prepend "ft-" and optionally append "-syntax", "-indent" or
"-plugin".  For example: >
	:help ft-vim-indent
	:help ft-vim-syntax
	:help ft-man-plugin

If the file type is not detected automatically, or it finds the wrong type,
you can either set the 'filetype' option manually, or add a modeline to your
file.  Example, for an IDL file use the command: >
	:set filetype=idl

or add this |modeline| to the file:
	/* vim: set filetype=idl : */ ~

						*:filetype-plugin-on*
You can enable loading the plugin files for specific file types with: >
	:filetype plugin on
If filetype detection was not switched on yet, it will be as well.
This actually loads the file "ftplugin.vim" in 'runtimepath'.
The result is that when a file is edited its plugin file is loaded (if there
is one for the detected filetype). |filetype-plugin|

						*:filetype-plugin-off*
You can disable it again with: >
	:filetype plugin off
The filetype detection is not switched off then.  But if you do switch off
filetype detection, the plugins will not be loaded either.
This actually loads the file "ftplugof.vim" in 'runtimepath'.

						*:filetype-indent-on*
You can enable loading the indent file for specific file types with: >
	:filetype indent on
If filetype detection was not switched on yet, it will be as well.
This actually loads the file "indent.vim" in 'runtimepath'.
The result is that when a file is edited its indent file is loaded (if there
is one for the detected filetype). |indent-expression|

						*:filetype-indent-off*
You can disable it again with: >
	:filetype indent off
The filetype detection is not switched off then.  But if you do switch off
filetype detection, the indent files will not be loaded either.
This actually loads the file "indoff.vim" in 'runtimepath'.
This disables auto-indenting for files you will open.  It will keep working in
already opened files.  Reset 'autoindent', 'cindent', 'smartindent' and/or
'indentexpr' to disable indenting in an opened file.

						*:filetype-off*
To disable file type detection, use this command: >
	:filetype off
This will keep the flags for "plugin" and "indent", but since no file types
are being detected, they won't work until the next ":filetype on".


Overview:					*:filetype-overview*

command				detection	plugin		indent ~
:filetype on			on		unchanged	unchanged
:filetype off			off		unchanged	unchanged
:filetype plugin on		on		on		unchanged
:filetype plugin off		unchanged	off		unchanged
:filetype indent on		on		unchanged	on
:filetype indent off		unchanged	unchanged	off
:filetype plugin indent on	on		on		on
:filetype plugin indent off	unchanged	off		off

To see the current status, type: >
	:filetype
The output looks something like this: >
	filetype detection:ON  plugin:ON  indent:OFF

The file types are also used for syntax highlighting.  If the ":syntax on"
command is used, the file type detection is installed too.  There is no need
to do ":filetype on" after ":syntax on".

To disable one of the file types, add a line in your filetype file, see
|remove-filetype|.

							*filetype-detect*
To detect the file type again: >
	:filetype detect
Use this if you started with an empty file and typed text that makes it
possible to detect the file type.  For example, when you entered this in a
shell script: "#!/bin/csh".
   When filetype detection was off, it will be enabled first, like the "on"
argument was used.

							*filetype-overrule*
When the same extension is used for two filetypes, Vim tries to guess what
kind of file it is.  This doesn't always work.  A number of global variables
can be used to overrule the filetype used for certain extensions:

	file name	variable ~
	*.asa		g:filetype_asa	|ft-aspvbs-syntax| |ft-aspperl-syntax|
	*.asp		g:filetype_asp	|ft-aspvbs-syntax| |ft-aspperl-syntax|
	*.asm		g:asmsyntax	|ft-asm-syntax|
	*.prg		g:filetype_prg
	*.pl		g:filetype_pl
	*.inc		g:filetype_inc
	*.w		g:filetype_w	|ft-cweb-syntax|
	*.i		g:filetype_i	|ft-progress-syntax|
	*.p		g:filetype_p	|ft-pascal-syntax|
	*.sh		g:bash_is_sh	|ft-sh-syntax|
	*.tex		g:tex_flavor	|ft-tex-plugin|

							*filetype-ignore*
To avoid that certain files are being inspected, the g:ft_ignore_pat variable
is used.  The default value is set like this: >
	:let g:ft_ignore_pat = '\.\(Z\|gz\|bz2\|zip\|tgz\)$'
This means that the contents of compressed files are not inspected.

							*new-filetype*
If a file type that you want to use is not detected yet, there are four ways
to add it.  In any way, it's better not to modify the $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim
file.  It will be overwritten when installing a new version of Vim.

A. If you want to overrule all default file type checks.
   This works by writing one file for each filetype.  The disadvantage is that
   means there can be many files.  The advantage is that you can simply drop
   this file in the right directory to make it work.
							*ftdetect*
   1. Create your user runtime directory.  You would normally use the first
      item of the 'runtimepath' option.  Then create the directory "ftdetect"
      inside it.  Example for Unix: >
	:!mkdir ~/.vim
	:!mkdir ~/.vim/ftdetect
<
   2. Create a file that contains an autocommand to detect the file type.
      Example: >
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.mine		set filetype=mine
<     Note that there is no "augroup" command, this has already been done
      when sourcing your file.  You could also use the pattern "*" and then
      check the contents of the file to recognize it.
      Write this file as "mine.vim" in the "ftdetect" directory in your user
      runtime directory.  For example, for Unix: >
	:w ~/.vim/ftdetect/mine.vim

<  3. To use the new filetype detection you must restart Vim.

   The files in the "ftdetect" directory are used after all the default
   checks, thus they can overrule a previously detected file type.  But you
   can also use |:setfiletype| to keep a previously detected filetype.

B. If you want to detect your file after the default file type checks.

   This works like A above, but instead of setting 'filetype' unconditionally
   use ":setfiletype".  This will only set 'filetype' if no file type was
   detected yet.  Example: >
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *.txt		setfiletype text
<
   You can also use the already detected file type in your command.  For
   example, to use the file type "mypascal" when "pascal" has been detected: >
	au BufRead,BufNewFile *		if &ft == 'pascal' | set ft=mypascal
								       | endif

C. If your file type can be detected by the file name.
   1. Create your user runtime directory.  You would normally use the first
      item of the 'runtimepath' option.  Example for Unix: >
	:!mkdir ~/.vim
<
   2. Create a file that contains autocommands to detect the file type.
      Example: >
	" my filetype file
	if exists("did_load_filetypes")
	  finish
	endif
	augroup filetypedetect
	  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.mine		setfiletype mine
	  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.xyz		setfiletype drawing
	augroup END
<     Write this file as "filetype.vim" in your user runtime directory.  For
      example, for Unix: >
	:w ~/.vim/filetype.vim

<  3. To use the new filetype detection you must restart Vim.

   Your filetype.vim will be sourced before the default FileType autocommands
   have been installed.  Your autocommands will match first, and the
   ":setfiletype" command will make sure that no other autocommands will set
   'filetype' after this.
							*new-filetype-scripts*
D. If your filetype can only be detected by inspecting the contents of the
   file.

   1. Create your user runtime directory.  You would normally use the first
      item of the 'runtimepath' option.  Example for Unix: >
	:!mkdir ~/.vim
<
   2. Create a vim script file for doing this.  Example: >
	if did_filetype()	" filetype already set..
	  finish		" ..don't do these checks
	endif
	if getline(1) =~ '^#!.*\<mine\>'
	  setfiletype mine
	elseif getline(1) =~? '\<drawing\>'
	  setfiletype drawing
	endif
<     See $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim for more examples.
      Write this file as "scripts.vim" in your user runtime directory.  For
      example, for Unix: >
	:w ~/.vim/scripts.vim
<
   3. The detection will work right away, no need to restart Vim.

   Your scripts.vim is loaded before the default checks for file types, which
   means that your rules override the default rules in
   $VIMRUNTIME/scripts.vim.

						*remove-filetype*
If a file type is detected that is wrong for you, install a filetype.vim or
scripts.vim to catch it (see above).  You can set 'filetype' to a non-existing
name to avoid that it will be set later anyway: >
	:set filetype=ignored

If you are setting up a system with many users, and you don't want each user
to add/remove the same filetypes, consider writing the filetype.vim and
scripts.vim files in a runtime directory that is used for everybody.  Check
the 'runtimepath' for a directory to use.  If there isn't one, set
'runtimepath' in the |system-vimrc|.  Be careful to keep the default
directories!


						*autocmd-osfiletypes*
NOTE: this code is currently disabled, as the RISC OS implementation was
removed.  In the future this will use the 'filetype' option.

On operating systems which support storing a file type with the file, you can
specify that an autocommand should only be executed if the file is of a
certain type.

The actual type checking depends on which platform you are running Vim
on; see your system's documentation for details.

To use osfiletype checking in an autocommand you should put a list of types to
match in angle brackets in place of a pattern, like this: >

	:au BufRead *.html,<&faf;HTML>  runtime! syntax/html.vim

This will match:

- Any file whose name ends in ".html"
- Any file whose type is "&faf" or "HTML", where the meaning of these types
  depends on which version of Vim you are using.
  Unknown types are considered NOT to match.

You can also specify a type and a pattern at the same time (in which case they
must both match): >

	:au BufRead <&fff>diff*

This will match files of type "&fff" whose names start with "diff".


							*plugin-details*
The "plugin" directory can be in any of the directories in the 'runtimepath'
option.  All of these directories will be searched for plugins and they are
all loaded.  For example, if this command: >

	set runtimepath

produces this output:

	runtimepath=/etc/vim,~/.vim,/usr/local/share/vim/vim60 ~

then Vim will load all plugins in these directories and below:

	/etc/vim/plugin/  ~
	~/.vim/plugin/  ~
	/usr/local/share/vim/vim60/plugin/  ~

Note that the last one is the value of $VIMRUNTIME which has been expanded.

What if it looks like your plugin is not being loaded?  You can find out what
happens when Vim starts up by using the |-V| argument: >

	vim -V2

You will see a lot of messages, in between them is a remark about loading the
plugins.  It starts with:

	Searching for "plugin/**/*.vim" in ~

There you can see where Vim looks for your plugin scripts.

==============================================================================
2. Filetype plugin					*filetype-plugins*

When loading filetype plugins has been enabled |:filetype-plugin-on|, options
will be set and mappings defined.  These are all local to the buffer, they
will not be used for other files.

Defining mappings for a filetype may get in the way of the mappings you
define yourself.  There are a few ways to avoid this:
1. Set the "maplocalleader" variable to the key sequence you want the mappings
   to start with.  Example: >
	:let maplocalleader = ","
<  All mappings will then start with a comma instead of the default, which
   is a backslash.  Also see |<LocalLeader>|.

2. Define your own mapping.  Example: >
	:map ,p <Plug>MailQuote
<  You need to check the description of the plugin file below for the
   functionality it offers and the string to map to.
   You need to define your own mapping before the plugin is loaded (before
   editing a file of that type).  The plugin will then skip installing the
   default mapping.

3. Disable defining mappings for a specific filetype by setting a variable,
   which contains the name of the filetype.  For the "mail" filetype this
   would be: >
	:let no_mail_maps = 1

4. Disable defining mappings for all filetypes by setting a variable: >
	:let no_plugin_maps = 1
<

							*ftplugin-overrule*
If a global filetype plugin does not do exactly what you want, there are three
ways to change this:

1. Add a few settings.
   You must create a new filetype plugin in a directory early in
   'runtimepath'.  For Unix, for example you could use this file: >
	vim ~/.vim/ftplugin/fortran.vim
<  You can set those settings and mappings that you would like to add.  Note
   that the global plugin will be loaded after this, it may overrule the
   settings that you do here.  If this is the case, you need to use one of the
   following two methods.

2. Make a copy of the plugin and change it.
   You must put the copy in a directory early in 'runtimepath'.  For Unix, for
   example, you could do this: >
	cp $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/fortran.vim ~/.vim/ftplugin/fortran.vim
<  Then you can edit the copied file to your liking.  Since the b:did_ftplugin
   variable will be set, the global plugin will not be loaded.
   A disadvantage of this method is that when the distributed plugin gets
   improved, you will have to copy and modify it again.

3. Overrule the settings after loading the global plugin.
   You must create a new filetype plugin in a directory from the end of
   'runtimepath'.  For Unix, for example, you could use this file: >
	vim ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/fortran.vim
<  In this file you can change just those settings that you want to change.

CHANGELOG						*ft-changelog-plugin*

Allows for easy entrance of Changelog entries in Changelog files.  There are
some commands, mappings, and variables worth exploring:

Options:
'comments'		is made empty to not mess up formatting.
'textwidth'		is set to 78, which is standard.
'formatoptions'		the 't' flag is added to wrap when inserting text.

Commands:
NewChangelogEntry	Adds a new Changelog entry in an intelligent fashion
			(see below).

Local mappings:
<Leader>o		Starts a new Changelog entry in an equally intelligent
			fashion (see below).

Global mappings:
			NOTE: The global mappings are accessed by sourcing the
			ftplugin/changelog.vim file first, e.g. with >
				runtime ftplugin/changelog.vim
<			in your |.vimrc|.
<Leader>o		Switches to the ChangeLog buffer opened for the
			current directory, or opens it in a new buffer if it
			exists in the current directory.  Then it does the
			same as the local <Leader>o described above.

Variables:
g:changelog_timeformat  Deprecated; use g:changelog_dateformat instead.
g:changelog_dateformat	The date (and time) format used in ChangeLog entries.
			The format accepted is the same as for the
			|strftime()| function.
			The default is "%Y-%m-%d" which is the standard format
			for many ChangeLog layouts.
g:changelog_username	The name and email address of the user.
			The default is deduced from environment variables and
			system files.  It searches /etc/passwd for the comment
			part of the current user, which informally contains
			the real name of the user up to the first separating
			comma.  then it checks the $NAME environment variable
			and finally runs `whoami` and `hostname` to build an
			email address.  The final form is >
				Full Name  <user@host>
<
g:changelog_new_date_format
			The format to use when creating a new date-entry.
			The following table describes special tokens in the
			string:
				%%	insert a single '%' character
				%d	insert the date from above
				%u	insert the user from above
                                %p	insert result of b:changelog_entry_prefix
				%c	where to position cursor when done
			The default is "%d  %u\n\n\t* %p%c\n\n", which produces
			something like (| is where cursor will be, unless at
			the start of the line where it denotes the beginning
			of the line) >
				|2003-01-14  Full Name  <user@host>
				|
				|        * prefix|
<
g:changelog_new_entry_format
			The format used when creating a new entry.
			The following table describes special tokens in the
			string:
                                %p	insert result of b:changelog_entry_prefix
				%c	where to position cursor when done
			The default is "\t*%c", which produces something
			similar to >
				|        * prefix|
<
g:changelog_date_entry_search
			The search pattern to use when searching for a
			date-entry.
			The same tokens that can be used for
			g:changelog_new_date_format can be used here as well.
			The default is '^\s*%d\_s*%u' which finds lines
			matching the form >
				|2003-01-14  Full Name  <user@host>
<			and some similar formats.

g:changelog_date_end_entry_search
			The search pattern to use when searching for the end
			of a date-entry.
			The same tokens that can be used for
			g:changelog_new_date_format can be used here as well.
			The default is '^\s*$' which finds lines that contain
			only whitespace or are completely empty.

b:changelog_name					*b:changelog_name*
			Name of the ChangeLog file to look for.
			The default is 'ChangeLog'.

b:changelog_path
			Path of the ChangeLog to use for the current buffer.
			The default is empty, thus looking for a file named
			|b:changelog_name| in the same directory as the
			current buffer.  If not found, the parent directory of
			the current buffer is searched.  This continues
			recursively until a file is found or there are no more
			parent directories to search.

b:changelog_entry_prefix
			Name of a function to call to generate a prefix to a
			new entry.  This function takes no arguments and
			should return a string containing the prefix.
			Returning an empty prefix is fine.
			The default generates the shortest path between the
			ChangeLog's pathname and the current buffers pathname.
			In the future, it will also be possible to use other
			variable contexts for this variable, for example, g:.

The Changelog entries are inserted where they add the least amount of text.
After figuring out the current date and user, the file is searched for an
entry beginning with the current date and user and if found adds another item
under it.  If not found, a new entry and item is prepended to the beginning of
the Changelog.


FORTRAN							*ft-fortran-plugin*

Options:
'expandtab'	is switched on to avoid tabs as required by the Fortran
		standards unless the user has set fortran_have_tabs in .vimrc.
'textwidth'	is set to 72 for fixed source format as required by the
		Fortran standards and to 80 for free source format.
'formatoptions' is set to break code and comment lines and to preserve long
		lines.  You can format comments with |gq|.
For further discussion of fortran_have_tabs and the method used for the
detection of source format see |ft-fortran-syntax|.


GIT COMMIT                                              *ft-gitcommit-plugin*

One command, :DiffGitCached, is provided to show a diff of the current commit
in the preview window.  It is equivalent to calling "git diff --cached" plus
any arguments given to the command.


MAIL							*ft-mail-plugin*

Options:
'modeline'	is switched off to avoid the danger of trojan horses, and to
		avoid that a Subject line with "Vim:" in it will cause an
		error message.
'textwidth'	is set to 72.  This is often recommended for e-mail.
'formatoptions'  is set to break text lines and to repeat the comment leader
		in new lines, so that a leading ">" for quotes is repeated.
		You can also format quoted text with |gq|.

Local mappings:
<LocalLeader>q   or   \\MailQuote
	Quotes the text selected in Visual mode, or from the cursor position
	to the end of the file in Normal mode.  This means "> " is inserted in
	each line.

MAN					*ft-man-plugin* *:Man* *man.vim*

Displays a manual page in a nice way.  Also see the user manual
|find-manpage|.

To start using the ":Man" command before any manual page was loaded, source
this script from your startup vimrc file: >

	runtime ftplugin/man.vim

Options:
'iskeyword'	the '.' character is added to be able to use CTRL-] on the
		manual page name.

Commands:
Man {name}	Display the manual page for {name} in a window.
Man {number} {name}
		Display the manual page for {name} in a section {number}.

Global mapping:
<Leader>K	Displays the manual page for the word under the cursor.
<Plug>ManPreGetPage  idem, allows for using a mapping: >
			nmap <F1> <Plug>ManPreGetPage<CR>

Local mappings:
CTRL-]		Jump to the manual page for the word under the cursor.
CTRL-T		Jump back to the previous manual page.
q		Same as ":quit"

To use a vertical split instead of horizontal: >
	let g:ft_man_open_mode = 'vert'
To use a new tab: >
	let g:ft_man_open_mode = 'tab'

To enable folding use this: >
  	let g:ft_man_folding_enable = 1
If you do not like the default folding, use an autocommand to add your desired
folding style instead.  For example: >
        autocmd FileType man setlocal foldmethod=indent foldenable

You may also want to set 'keywordprg' to make the |K| command open a manual
page in a Vim window: >
	set keywordprg=:Man


MANPAGER				      *manpager.vim*

The :Man command allows you to turn Vim into a manpager (that syntax highlights
manpages and follows linked manpages on hitting CTRL-]).

Works on:

  - Linux
  - Mac OS
  - FreeBSD
  - Cygwin
  - Win 10 under Bash

Untested:

  - Amiga OS
  - BeOS
  - OS/2

For bash,zsh,ksh or dash by adding to the config file (.bashrc,.zshrc, ...)

	export MANPAGER="env MAN_PN=1 vim -M +MANPAGER -"

For (t)csh by adding to the config file

	setenv MANPAGER "env MAN_PN=1 vim -M +MANPAGER -"

For fish by adding to the config file

	set -x MANPAGER "env MAN_PN=1 vim -M +MANPAGER -"

If man sets the $MAN_PN environment variable, like man-db, the most common
implementation on Linux and Mac OS, then the "env MAN_PN=1 " part above is
superfluous.

PDF							*ft-pdf-plugin*

Two maps, <C-]> and <C-T>, are provided to simulate a tag stack for navigating
the PDF.  The following are treated as tags:

- The byte offset after "startxref" to the xref table
- The byte offset after the /Prev key in the trailer to an earlier xref table
- A line of the form "0123456789 00000 n" in the xref table
- An object reference like "1 0 R" anywhere in the PDF

These maps can be disabled with >
	:let g:no_pdf_maps = 1
<

PYTHON						*ft-python-plugin* *PEP8*

By default the following options are set, in accordance with PEP8: >

	setlocal expandtab shiftwidth=4 softtabstop=4 tabstop=8

To disable this behaviour, set the following variable in your vimrc: >
	
	let g:python_recommended_style = 0


RPM SPEC						*ft-spec-plugin*

Since the text for this plugin is rather long it has been put in a separate
file: |pi_spec.txt|.


SQL							*ft-sql*

Since the text for this plugin is rather long it has been put in a separate
file: |ft_sql.txt|.


TEX						*ft-tex-plugin* *g:tex_flavor*

If the first line of a *.tex file has the form >
	%&<format>
then this determined the file type:  plaintex (for plain TeX), context (for
ConTeXt), or tex (for LaTeX).  Otherwise, the file is searched for keywords to
choose context or tex.  If no keywords are found, it defaults to plaintex.
You can change the default by defining the variable g:tex_flavor to the format
(not the file type) you use most.  Use one of these: >
	let g:tex_flavor = "plain"
	let g:tex_flavor = "context"
	let g:tex_flavor = "latex"
Currently no other formats are recognized.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Folding						*Folding* *folding* *folds*

You can find an introduction on folding in chapter 28 of the user manual.
|usr_28.txt|

1. Fold methods		|fold-methods|
2. Fold commands	|fold-commands|
3. Fold options		|fold-options|
4. Behavior of folds	|fold-behavior|

{Vi has no Folding}
{not available when compiled without the |+folding| feature}

==============================================================================
1. Fold methods					*fold-methods*

The folding method can be set with the 'foldmethod' option.

When setting 'foldmethod' to a value other than "manual", all folds are
deleted and new ones created.  Switching to the "manual" method doesn't remove
the existing folds.  This can be used to first define the folds automatically
and then change them manually.

There are six methods to select folds:
	manual		manually define folds
	indent		more indent means a higher fold level
	expr		specify an expression to define folds
	syntax		folds defined by syntax highlighting
	diff		folds for unchanged text
	marker		folds defined by markers in the text


MANUAL						*fold-manual*

Use commands to manually define the fold regions.  This can also be used by a
script that parses text to find folds.

The level of a fold is only defined by its nesting.  To increase the fold
level of a fold for a range of lines, define a fold inside it that has the
same lines.

The manual folds are lost when you abandon the file.  To save the folds use
the |:mkview| command.  The view can be restored later with |:loadview|.


INDENT						*fold-indent*

The folds are automatically defined by the indent of the lines.

The foldlevel is computed from the indent of the line, divided by the
'shiftwidth' (rounded down).  A sequence of lines with the same or higher fold
level form a fold, with the lines with a higher level forming a nested fold.

The nesting of folds is limited with 'foldnestmax'.

Some lines are ignored and get the fold level of the line above or below it,
whichever is lower.  These are empty or white lines and lines starting
with a character in 'foldignore'.  White space is skipped before checking for
characters in 'foldignore'.  For C use "#" to ignore preprocessor lines.

When you want to ignore lines in another way, use the 'expr' method.  The
|indent()| function can be used in 'foldexpr' to get the indent of a line.


EXPR						*fold-expr*

The folds are automatically defined by their foldlevel, like with the "indent"
method.  The value of the 'foldexpr' option is evaluated to get the foldlevel
of a line.  Examples:
This will create a fold for all consecutive lines that start with a tab: >
	:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)[0]==\"\\t\"
This will call a function to compute the fold level: >
	:set foldexpr=MyFoldLevel(v:lnum)
This will make a fold out of paragraphs separated by blank lines: >
	:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum)=~'^\\s*$'&&getline(v:lnum+1)=~'\\S'?'<1':1
this does the same: >
	:set foldexpr=getline(v:lnum-1)=~'^\\s*$'&&getline(v:lnum)=~'\\S'?'>1':1

Note that backslashes must be used to escape characters that ":set" handles
differently (space, backslash, double quote, etc., see |option-backslash|).

These are the conditions with which the expression is evaluated:
- The current buffer and window are set for the line.
- The variable "v:lnum" is set to the line number.
- The result is used for the fold level in this way:
  value			meaning ~
  0			the line is not in a fold
  1, 2, ..		the line is in a fold with this level
  -1			the fold level is undefined, use the fold level of a
			line before or after this line, whichever is the
			lowest.
  "="			use fold level from the previous line
  "a1", "a2", ..	add one, two, .. to the fold level of the previous
			line, use the result for the current line
  "s1", "s2", ..	subtract one, two, .. from the fold level of the
			previous line, use the result for the next line
  "<1", "<2", ..	a fold with this level ends at this line
  ">1", ">2", ..	a fold with this level starts at this line

It is not required to mark the start (end) of a fold with ">1" ("<1"), a fold
will also start (end) when the fold level is higher (lower) than the fold
level of the previous line.

There must be no side effects from the expression.  The text in the buffer,
cursor position, the search patterns, options etc. must not be changed.
You can change and restore them if you are careful.

If there is some error in the expression, or the resulting value isn't
recognized, there is no error message and the fold level will be zero.
For debugging the 'debug' option can be set to "msg", the error messages will
be visible then.

Note: Since the expression has to be evaluated for every line, this fold
method can be very slow!

Try to avoid the "=", "a" and "s" return values, since Vim often has to search
backwards for a line for which the fold level is defined.  This can be slow.

An example of using "a1" and "s1": For a multi-line C comment, a line
containing "/*" would return "a1" to start a fold, and a line containing "*/"
would return "s1" to end the fold after that line: >
  if match(thisline, '/\*') >= 0
    return 'a1'
  elseif match(thisline, '\*/') >= 0
    return 's1'
  else
    return '='
  endif
However, this won't work for single line comments, strings, etc.

|foldlevel()| can be useful to compute a fold level relative to a previous
fold level.  But note that foldlevel() may return -1 if the level is not known
yet.  And it returns the level at the start of the line, while a fold might
end in that line.

It may happened that folds are not updated properly.  You can use |zx| or |zX|
to force updating folds.


SYNTAX						*fold-syntax*

A fold is defined by syntax items that have the "fold" argument. |:syn-fold|

The fold level is defined by nesting folds.  The nesting of folds is limited
with 'foldnestmax'.

Be careful to specify proper syntax syncing.  If this is not done right, folds
may differ from the displayed highlighting.  This is especially relevant when
using patterns that match more than one line.  In case of doubt, try using
brute-force syncing: >
	:syn sync fromstart


DIFF						*fold-diff*

The folds are automatically defined for text that is not part of a change or
close to a change.

This method only works properly when the 'diff' option is set for the current
window and changes are being displayed.  Otherwise the whole buffer will be
one big fold.

The 'diffopt' option can be used to specify the context.  That is, the number
of lines between the fold and a change that are not included in the fold.  For
example, to use a context of 8 lines: >
	:set diffopt=filler,context:8
The default context is six lines.

When 'scrollbind' is also set, Vim will attempt to keep the same folds open in
other diff windows, so that the same text is visible.


MARKER						*fold-marker*

Markers in the text tell where folds start and end.  This allows you to
precisely specify the folds.  This will allow deleting and putting a fold,
without the risk of including the wrong lines.  The 'foldtext' option is
normally set such that the text before the marker shows up in the folded line.
This makes it possible to give a name to the fold.

Markers can have a level included, or can use matching pairs.  Including a
level is easier, you don't have to add end markers and avoid problems with
non-matching marker pairs.  Example: >
	/* global variables {{{1 */
	int varA, varB;

	/* functions {{{1 */
	/* funcA() {{{2 */
	void funcA() {}

	/* funcB() {{{2 */
	void funcB() {}

A fold starts at a "{{{" marker.  The following number specifies the fold
level.  What happens depends on the difference between the current fold level
and the level given by the marker:
1. If a marker with the same fold level is encountered, the previous fold
   ends and another fold with the same level starts.
2. If a marker with a higher fold level is found, a nested fold is started.
3. if a marker with a lower fold level is found, all folds up to and including
   this level end and a fold with the specified level starts.

The number indicates the fold level.  A zero cannot be used (a marker with
level zero is ignored).  You can use "}}}" with a digit to indicate the level
of the fold that ends.  The fold level of the following line will be one less
than the indicated level.  Note that Vim doesn't look back to the level of the
matching marker (that would take too much time).  Example: >

	{{{1
	fold level here is 1
	{{{3
	fold level here is 3
	}}}3
	fold level here is 2

You can also use matching pairs of "{{{" and "}}}" markers to define folds.
Each "{{{" increases the fold level by one, each "}}}" decreases the fold
level by one.  Be careful to keep the markers matching!  Example: >

	{{{
	fold level here is 1
	{{{
	fold level here is 2
	}}}
	fold level here is 1

You can mix using markers with a number and without a number.  A useful way of
doing this is to use numbered markers for large folds, and unnumbered markers
locally in a function.  For example use level one folds for the sections of
your file like "structure definitions", "local variables" and "functions".
Use level 2 markers for each definition and function,  Use unnumbered markers
inside functions.  When you make changes in a function to split up folds, you
don't have to renumber the markers.

The markers can be set with the 'foldmarker' option.  It is recommended to
keep this at the default value of "{{{,}}}", so that files can be exchanged
between Vim users.  Only change it when it is required for the file (e.g., it
contains markers from another folding editor, or the default markers cause
trouble for the language of the file).

							*fold-create-marker*
"zf" can be used to create a fold defined by markers.  Vim will insert the
markers for you.  Vim will append the start and end marker, as specified with
'foldmarker'.  The markers are appended to the end of the line.
'commentstring' is used if it isn't empty.
This does not work properly when:
- The line already contains a marker with a level number.  Vim then doesn't
  know what to do.
- Folds nearby use a level number in their marker which gets in the way.
- The line is inside a comment, 'commentstring' isn't empty and nested
  comments don't work.  For example with C: adding /* {{{ */ inside a comment
  will truncate the existing comment.  Either put the marker before or after
  the comment, or add the marker manually.
Generally it's not a good idea to let Vim create markers when you already have
markers with a level number.

							*fold-delete-marker*
"zd" can be used to delete a fold defined by markers.  Vim will delete the
markers for you.  Vim will search for the start and end markers, as specified
with 'foldmarker', at the start and end of the fold.  When the text around the
marker matches with 'commentstring', that text is deleted as well.
This does not work properly when:
- A line contains more than one marker and one of them specifies a level.
  Only the first one is removed, without checking if this will have the
  desired effect of deleting the fold.
- The marker contains a level number and is used to start or end several folds
  at the same time.

==============================================================================
2. Fold commands				*fold-commands* *E490*

All folding commands start with "z".  Hint: the "z" looks like a folded piece
of paper, if you look at it from the side.


CREATING AND DELETING FOLDS ~
							*zf* *E350*
zf{motion}  or
{Visual}zf	Operator to create a fold.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		The new fold will be closed for the "manual" method.
		'foldenable' will be set.
		Also see |fold-create-marker|.

							*zF*
zF		Create a fold for [count] lines.  Works like "zf".

:{range}fo[ld]						*:fold* *:fo*
		Create a fold for the lines in {range}.  Works like "zf".

							*zd* *E351*
zd		Delete one fold at the cursor.  When the cursor is on a folded
		line, that fold is deleted.  Nested folds are moved one level
		up.  In Visual mode one level of all folds (partially) in the
		selected area are deleted.
		Careful: This easily deletes more folds than you expect and
		there is no undo for manual folding.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		Also see |fold-delete-marker|.

							*zD*
zD		Delete folds recursively at the cursor.  In Visual mode all
		folds (partially) in the selected area and all nested folds in
		them are deleted.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		Also see |fold-delete-marker|.

							*zE* *E352*
zE		Eliminate all folds in the window.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		Also see |fold-delete-marker|.


OPENING AND CLOSING FOLDS ~

A fold smaller than 'foldminlines' will always be displayed like it was open.
Therefore the commands below may work differently on small folds.

							*zo*
zo		Open one fold under the cursor.  When a count is given, that
		many folds deep will be opened.  In Visual mode one level of
		folds is opened for all lines in the selected area.

							*zO*
zO		Open all folds under the cursor recursively.  Folds that don't
		contain the cursor line are unchanged.
		In Visual mode it opens all folds that are in the selected
		area, also those that are only partly selected.

							*zc*
zc		Close one fold under the cursor.  When a count is given, that
		many folds deep are closed.  In Visual mode one level of folds
		is closed for all lines in the selected area.
		'foldenable' will be set.

							*zC*
zC		Close all folds under the cursor recursively.  Folds that
		don't contain the cursor line are unchanged.
		In Visual mode it closes all folds that are in the selected
		area, also those that are only partly selected.
		'foldenable' will be set.

							*za*
za		When on a closed fold: open it.  When folds are nested, you
		may have to use "za" several times.  When a count is given,
		that many closed folds are opened.
		When on an open fold: close it and set 'foldenable'.  This
		will only close one level, since using "za" again will open
		the fold.  When a count is given that many folds will be
		closed (that's not the same as repeating "za" that many
		times).

							*zA*
zA		When on a closed fold: open it recursively.
		When on an open fold: close it recursively and set
		'foldenable'.

							*zv*
zv		View cursor line: Open just enough folds to make the line in
		which the cursor is located not folded.

							*zx*
zx		Update folds: Undo manually opened and closed folds: re-apply
		'foldlevel', then do "zv": View cursor line.
		Also forces recomputing folds.  This is useful when using
		'foldexpr' and the buffer is changed in a way that results in
		folds not to be updated properly.

							*zX*
zX		Undo manually opened and closed folds: re-apply 'foldlevel'.
		Also forces recomputing folds, like |zx|.

							*zm*
zm		Fold more: Subtract |v:count1| from 'foldlevel'.  If 'foldlevel' was
		already zero nothing happens.
		'foldenable' will be set.

							*zM*
zM		Close all folds: set 'foldlevel' to 0.
		'foldenable' will be set.

							*zr*
zr		Reduce folding: Add |v:count1| to 'foldlevel'.

							*zR*
zR		Open all folds.  This sets 'foldlevel' to highest fold level.

							*:foldo* *:foldopen*
:{range}foldo[pen][!]
		Open folds in {range}.  When [!] is added all folds are
		opened.  Useful to see all the text in {range}.  Without [!]
		one level of folds is opened.

							*:foldc* *:foldclose*
:{range}foldc[lose][!]
		Close folds in {range}.  When [!] is added all folds are
		closed.  Useful to hide all the text in {range}.  Without [!]
		one level of folds is closed.

							*zn*
zn		Fold none: reset 'foldenable'.  All folds will be open.

							*zN*
zN		Fold normal: set 'foldenable'.  All folds will be as they
		were before.

							*zi*
zi		Invert 'foldenable'.


MOVING OVER FOLDS ~
							*[z*
[z		Move to the start of the current open fold.  If already at the
		start, move to the start of the fold that contains it.  If
		there is no containing fold, the command fails.
		When a count is used, repeats the command [count] times.

							*]z*
]z		Move to the end of the current open fold.  If already at the
		end, move to the end of the fold that contains it.  If there
		is no containing fold, the command fails.
		When a count is used, repeats the command [count] times.

							*zj*
zj		Move downwards to the start of the next fold.  A closed fold
		is counted as one fold.
		When a count is used, repeats the command [count] times.
		This command can be used after an |operator|.

							*zk*
zk		Move upwards to the end of the previous fold.  A closed fold
		is counted as one fold.
		When a count is used, repeats the command [count] times.
		This command can be used after an |operator|.


EXECUTING COMMANDS ON FOLDS ~

:[range]foldd[oopen] {cmd}			*:foldd* *:folddoopen*
		Execute {cmd} on all lines that are not in a closed fold.
		When [range] is given, only these lines are used.
		Each time {cmd} is executed the cursor is positioned on the
		line it is executed for.
		This works like the ":global" command: First all lines that
		are not in a closed fold are marked.  Then the {cmd} is
		executed for all marked lines.  Thus when {cmd} changes the
		folds, this has no influence on where it is executed (except
		when lines are deleted, of course).
		Example: >
			:folddoopen s/end/loop_end/ge
<		Note the use of the "e" flag to avoid getting an error message
		where "end" doesn't match.

:[range]folddoc[losed] {cmd}			*:folddoc* *:folddoclosed*
		Execute {cmd} on all lines that are in a closed fold.
		Otherwise like ":folddoopen".

==============================================================================
3. Fold options					*fold-options*

COLORS							*fold-colors*

The colors of a closed fold are set with the Folded group |hl-Folded|.  The
colors of the fold column are set with the FoldColumn group |hl-FoldColumn|.
Example to set the colors: >

	:highlight Folded guibg=grey guifg=blue
	:highlight FoldColumn guibg=darkgrey guifg=white


FOLDLEVEL						*fold-foldlevel*

'foldlevel' is a number option: The higher the more folded regions are open.
When 'foldlevel' is 0, all folds are closed.
When 'foldlevel' is positive, some folds are closed.
When 'foldlevel' is very high, all folds are open.
'foldlevel' is applied when it is changed.  After that manually folds can be
opened and closed.
When increased, folds above the new level are opened.  No manually opened
folds will be closed.
When decreased, folds above the new level are closed.  No manually closed
folds will be opened.


FOLDTEXT						*fold-foldtext*

'foldtext' is a string option that specifies an expression.  This expression
is evaluated to obtain the text displayed for a closed fold.  Example: >

    :set foldtext=v:folddashes.substitute(getline(v:foldstart),'/\\*\\\|\\*/\\\|{{{\\d\\=','','g')

This shows the first line of the fold, with "/*", "*/" and "{{{" removed.
Note the use of backslashes to avoid some characters to be interpreted by the
":set" command.  It's simpler to define a function and call that: >

    :set foldtext=MyFoldText()
    :function MyFoldText()
    :  let line = getline(v:foldstart)
    :  let sub = substitute(line, '/\*\|\*/\|{{{\d\=', '', 'g')
    :  return v:folddashes . sub
    :endfunction

Evaluating 'foldtext' is done in the |sandbox|.  The current window is set to
the window that displays the line.  Errors are ignored.

The default value is |foldtext()|.  This returns a reasonable text for most
types of folding.  If you don't like it, you can specify your own 'foldtext'
expression.  It can use these special Vim variables:
	v:foldstart	line number of first line in the fold
	v:foldend	line number of last line in the fold
	v:folddashes	a string that contains dashes to represent the
			foldlevel.
	v:foldlevel	the foldlevel of the fold

In the result a TAB is replaced with a space and unprintable characters are
made into printable characters.

The resulting line is truncated to fit in the window, it never wraps.
When there is room after the text, it is filled with the character specified
by 'fillchars'.

Note that backslashes need to be used for characters that the ":set" command
handles differently: Space, backslash and double-quote. |option-backslash|


FOLDCOLUMN						*fold-foldcolumn*

'foldcolumn' is a number, which sets the width for a column on the side of the
window to indicate folds.  When it is zero, there is no foldcolumn.  A normal
value is 4 or 5.  The minimal useful value is 2, although 1 still provides
some information.  The maximum is 12.

An open fold is indicated with a column that has a '-' at the top and '|'
characters below it.  This column stops where the open fold stops.  When folds
nest, the nested fold is one character right of the fold it's contained in.

A closed fold is indicated with a '+'.

Where the fold column is too narrow to display all nested folds, digits are
shown to indicate the nesting level.

The mouse can also be used to open and close folds by clicking in the
fold column:
- Click on a '+' to open the closed fold at this row.
- Click on any other non-blank character to close the open fold at this row.


OTHER OPTIONS

'foldenable'  'fen':	Open all folds while not set.
'foldexpr'    'fde':	Expression used for "expr" folding.
'foldignore'  'fdi':	Characters used for "indent" folding.
'foldmarker'  'fmr':	Defined markers used for "marker" folding.
'foldmethod'  'fdm':	Name of the current folding method.
'foldminlines' 'fml':	Minimum number of screen lines for a fold to be
			displayed closed.
'foldnestmax' 'fdn':	Maximum nesting for "indent" and "syntax" folding.
'foldopen'    'fdo':	Which kinds of commands open closed folds.
'foldclose'   'fcl':	When the folds not under the cursor are closed.

==============================================================================
4. Behavior of folds					*fold-behavior*

When moving the cursor upwards or downwards and when scrolling, the cursor
will move to the first line of a sequence of folded lines.  When the cursor is
already on a folded line, it moves to the next unfolded line or the next
closed fold.

While the cursor is on folded lines, the cursor is always displayed in the
first column.  The ruler does show the actual cursor position, but since the
line is folded, it cannot be displayed there.

Many movement commands handle a sequence of folded lines like an empty line.
For example, the "w" command stops once in the first column.

When in Insert mode, the cursor line is never folded.  That allows you to see
what you type!

When using an operator, a closed fold is included as a whole.  Thus "dl"
deletes the whole closed fold under the cursor.

For Ex commands that work on buffer lines the range is adjusted to always
start at the first line of a closed fold and end at the last line of a closed
fold.  Thus this command: >
	:s/foo/bar/g
when used with the cursor on a closed fold, will replace "foo" with "bar" in
all lines of the fold.
This does not happen for |:folddoopen| and |:folddoclosed|.

When editing a buffer that has been edited before, the last used folding
settings are used again.  For manual folding the defined folds are restored.
For all folding methods the manually opened and closed folds are restored.
If this buffer has been edited in this window, the values from back then are
used.  Otherwise the values from the window where the buffer was edited last
are used.

6.  Extra Plug-ins			    |ada-extra-plugins|

==============================================================================
1. Syntax Highlighting ~
							       *ft-ada-syntax*

This mode is designed for the 2005 edition of Ada ("Ada 2005"), which includes
support for objected-programming, protected types, and so on.  It handles code
written for the original Ada language ("Ada83", "Ada87", "Ada95") as well,
though code which uses Ada 2005-only keywords will be wrongly colored (such
code should be fixed anyway).  For more information about Ada, see
http://www.adapower.com.

The Ada mode handles a number of situations cleanly.

For example, it knows that the "-" in "-5" is a number, but the same character
in "A-5" is an operator.  Normally, a "with" or "use" clause referencing
another compilation unit is coloured the same way as C's "#include" is coloured.
If you have "Conditional" or "Repeat" groups coloured differently, then "end
if" and "end loop" will be coloured as part of those respective groups.

You can set these to different colours using vim's "highlight" command (e.g.,
to change how loops are displayed, enter the command ":hi Repeat" followed by
the colour specification; on simple terminals the colour specification
ctermfg=White often shows well).

There are several options you can select in this Ada mode. See |ft-ada-options|
for a complete list.

To enable them, assign a value to the option.  For example, to turn one on:
 >
    > let g:ada_standard_types = 1
>
To disable them use ":unlet".  Example:
>
    > unlet g:ada_standard_types

You can just use ":" and type these into the command line to set these
temporarily before loading an Ada file.  You can make these option settings
permanent by adding the "let" command(s), without a colon, to your "~/.vimrc"
file.

Even on a slow (90Mhz) PC this mode works quickly, but if you find the
performance unacceptable, turn on |g:ada_withuse_ordinary|.

Syntax folding instructions (|fold-syntax|) are added when |g:ada_folding| is
set.

==============================================================================
2. File type Plug-in ~
					       *ft-ada-indent* *ft-ada-plugin*

The Ada plug-in provides support for:

 - auto indenting	(|indent.txt|)
 - insert completion	(|i_CTRL-N|)
 - user completion	(|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|)
 - tag searches		(|tagsrch.txt|)
 - Quick Fix		(|quickfix.txt|)
 - backspace handling	(|'backspace'|)
 - comment handling	(|'comments'|, |'commentstring'|)

The plug-in only activates the features of the Ada mode whenever an Ada
file is opened and adds Ada related entries to the main and pop-up menu.

==============================================================================
3. Omni Completion ~
								 *ft-ada-omni*

The Ada omni-completions (|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|) uses tags database created either
by "gnat xref -v" or the "exuberant Ctags (http://ctags.sourceforge.net).  The
complete function will automatically detect which tool was used to create the
tags file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Omni Completion with "gnat xref" ~
								   *gnat-xref*

GNAT XREF uses the compiler internal information (ali-files) to produce the
tags file. This has the advantage to be 100% correct and the option of deep
nested analysis. However the code must compile, the generator is quite
slow and the created tags file contains only the basic Ctags information for
each entry - not enough for some of the more advanced Vim code browser
plug-ins.

NOTE: "gnat xref -v" is very tricky to use as it has almost no diagnostic
       output - If nothing is printed then usually the parameters are wrong.
       Here some important tips:

1)  You need to compile your code first and use the "-aO" option to point to
    your .ali files.
2)  "gnat xref -v ../Include/adacl.ads" won't work - use  the "gnat xref -v
    -aI../Include adacl.ads" instead.
3)  "gnat xref -v -aI../Include *.ad?" won't work - use "cd ../Include" and
    then "gnat xref -v *.ad?"
4)  Project manager support is completely broken - don't even try "gnat xref
    -Padacl.gpr".
5)  VIM is faster when the tags file is sorted - use "sort --unique
    --ignore-case --output=tags tags" .
6)  Remember to insert "!_TAG_FILE_SORTED 2 %sort ui" as first line to mark
    the file assorted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Omni Completion with "ctags"~
								   *ada-ctags*

Exuberant Ctags uses its own multi-language code parser. The parser is quite
fast, produces a lot of extra information (hence the name "Exuberant Ctags")
and can run on files which currently do not compile.

There are also lots of other Vim-tools which use exuberant Ctags.

You will need to install a version of the Exuberant Ctags which has Ada
support patched in. Such a version is available from the GNU Ada Project
(http://gnuada.sourceforge.net).

The Ada parser for Exuberant Ctags is fairly new - don't expect complete
support yet.

==============================================================================
4. Compiler Support ~
								*ada-compiler*

The Ada mode supports more than one Ada compiler and will automatically load the
compiler set in |g:ada_default_compiler| whenever an Ada source is opened. The
provided compiler plug-ins are split into the actual compiler plug-in and a
collection of support functions and variables. This allows the easy
development of specialized compiler plug-ins fine tuned to your development
environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 GNAT ~
							       *compiler-gnat*

GNAT is the only free (beer and speech) Ada compiler available. There are
several versions available which differ in the licence terms used.

The GNAT compiler plug-in will perform a compile on pressing <F7> and then
immediately shows the result. You can set the project file to be used by
setting:
 >
 > call g:gnat.Set_Project_File ('my_project.gpr')

Setting a project file will also create a Vim session (|views-sessions|) so -
like with the GPS - opened files, window positions etc. will be remembered
separately for all projects.

								*gnat_members*
GNAT OBJECT ~

							       *g:gnat.Make()*
g:gnat.Make()
		Calls |g:gnat.Make_Command| and displays the result inside a
               |quickfix| window.

							     *g:gnat.Pretty()*
g:gnat.Pretty()
		Calls |g:gnat.Pretty_Program|

							       *g:gnat.Find()*
g:gnat.Find()
		Calls |g:gnat.Find_Program|

							       *g:gnat.Tags()*
g:gnat.Tags()
		Calls |g:gnat.Tags_Command|

						   *g:gnat.Set_Project_File()*
g:gnat.Set_Project_File([{file}])
		Set gnat project file and load associated session.  An open
		project will be closed and the session written.  If called
		without file name the file selector opens for selection of a
		project file. If called with an empty string then the project
		and associated session are closed.

							 *g:gnat.Project_File*
g:gnat.Project_File	string
		Current project file.

							 *g:gnat.Make_Command*
g:gnat.Make_Command	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Make()| (|'makeprg'|).

						       *g:gnat.Pretty_Program*
g:gnat.Pretty_Program	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Pretty()|

							 *g:gnat.Find_Program*
g:gnat.Find_Program	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Find()|

							 *g:gnat.Tags_Command*
g:gnat.Tags_Command	string
		External command used for |g:gnat.Tags()|

							 *g:gnat.Error_Format*
g:gnat.Error_Format	string
		Error format (|'errorformat'|)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Dec Ada ~
					    *compiler-hpada* *compiler-decada*
					*compiler-vaxada* *compiler-compaqada*

Dec Ada (also known by - in chronological order - VAX Ada, Dec Ada, Compaq Ada
and HP Ada) is a fairly dated Ada 83 compiler. Support is basic: <F7> will
compile the current unit.

The Dec Ada compiler expects the package name and not the file name to be
passed as a parameter. The compiler plug-in supports the usual file name
convention to convert the file into a unit name. Both '-' and '__' are allowed
as separators.

							      *decada_members*
DEC ADA OBJECT ~

							     *g:decada.Make()*
g:decada.Make()		function
		Calls |g:decada.Make_Command| and displays the result inside a
		|quickfix| window.

							*g:decada.Unit_Name()*
g:decada.Unit_Name()	function
		Get the Unit name for the current file.

g:ada_standard_types	bool (true when exists)
		Highlight types in package Standard (e.g., "Float").

							  *g:ada_space_errors*
						  *g:ada_no_trail_space_error*
						    *g:ada_no_tab_space_error*
							 *g:ada_all_tab_usage*

		Highlight lines which are too long. Note: This highlighting
		option is quite CPU intensive.

							 *g:ada_rainbow_color*
g:ada_rainbow_color	  bool (true when exists)
		Use rainbow colours for '(' and ')'. You need the
		rainbow_parenthesis for this to work.

							       *g:ada_folding*
g:ada_folding		  set ('sigpft')
		Use folding for Ada sources.
		    's':    activate syntax folding on load
			'p':    fold packages
			'f':    fold functions and procedures
			't':    fold types
			'c':    fold conditionals
		    'g':    activate gnat pretty print folding on load
			'i':    lone 'is' folded with line above
			'b':	lone 'begin' folded with line above
			'p':	lone 'private' folded with line above
			'x':	lone 'exception' folded with line above
		    'i':    activate indent folding on load

		Note: Syntax folding is in an early (unusable) stage and
		      indent or gnat pretty folding is suggested.

		For gnat pretty folding to work the following settings are
		suggested: -cl3 -M79 -c2 -c3 -c4 -A1 -A2 -A3 -A4 -A5

		For indent folding to work the following settings are
		suggested: shiftwidth=3 softtabstop=3

								*g:ada_abbrev*
g:ada_abbrev		  bool (true when exists)
		Add some abbreviations. This feature is more or less superseded
		by the various completion methods.

						      *g:ada_withuse_ordinary*
g:ada_withuse_ordinary	  bool (true when exists)
		Show "with" and "use" as ordinary keywords (when used to
		reference other compilation units they're normally highlighted
		specially).

							 *g:ada_begin_preproc*
g:ada_begin_preproc	  bool (true when exists)
		Show all begin-like keywords using the colouring of C
		preprocessor commands.

						    *g:ada_omni_with_keywords*
g:ada_omni_with_keywords

g:ada_extended_tagging	  enum ('jump', 'list')
		use extended tagging, two options are available
		    'jump': use tjump to jump.
		    'list': add tags quick fix list.
		Normal tagging does not support function or operator
		overloading as these features are not available in C and
		tagging was originally developed for C.

						   *g:ada_extended_completion*
g:ada_extended_completion
		Uses extended completion for <C-N> and <C-R> completions
		(|i_CTRL-N|). In this mode the '.' is used as part of the
		identifier so that 'Object.Method' or 'Package.Procedure' are
		completed together.

						       *g:ada_gnat_extensions*
g:ada_gnat_extensions	  bool (true when exists)
		 Support GNAT extensions.

					       *g:ada_with_gnat_project_files*
g:ada_with_gnat_project_files	 bool (true when exists)
		 Add gnat project file keywords and Attributes.

						      *g:ada_default_compiler*
g:ada_default_compiler	  string
		set default compiler. Currently supported are 'gnat' and
		'decada'.

An "exists" type is a boolean considered true when the variable is defined and
false when the variable is undefined. The value to which the variable is set
makes no difference.

6. Extra Plugins ~
							   *ada-extra-plugins*

You can optionally install the following extra plug-ins. They work well with
Ada and enhance the ability of the Ada mode:

backup.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1537
	Keeps as many backups as you like so you don't have to.

rainbow_parenthsis.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1561
	Very helpful since Ada uses only '(' and ')'.

nerd_comments.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218
	Excellent commenting and uncommenting support for almost any
	programming language.

matchit.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39
	'%' jumping for any language. The normal '%' jump only works for '{}'
	style languages. The Ada mode will set the needed search patterns.

taglist.vim
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273
	Source code explorer sidebar. There is a patch for Ada available.

The GNU Ada Project distribution (http://gnuada.sourceforge.net) of Vim
contains all of the above.

Last change: 2013 May 15

by David Fishburn

This is a filetype plugin to work with SQL files.

The Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard which specifies statements
that allow a user to interact with a relational database.  Vim includes
features for navigation, indentation and syntax highlighting.

==============================================================================
1. Navigation					*sql-navigation*

The SQL ftplugin provides a number of options to assist with file
navigation.


1.1 Matchit					*sql-matchit*
-----------
The matchit plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39)
provides many additional features and can be customized for different
languages.  The matchit plugin is configured by defining a local
buffer variable, b:match_words.  Pressing the % key while on various
keywords will move the cursor to its match.  For example, if the cursor
is on an "if", pressing % will cycle between the "else", "elseif" and
"end if" keywords.

The following keywords are supported: >
    if
    elseif | elsif
    else [if]
    end if

    [while condition] loop
	leave
	break
	continue
	exit
    end loop

    for
	leave
	break
	continue
	exit
    end loop

    do
	statements
    doend

    case
    when
    when
    default
    end case

    merge
    when not matched
    when matched

    create[ or replace] procedure|function|event
    returns


1.2 Text Object Motions				*sql-object-motions*
-----------------------
Vim has a number of predefined keys for working with text |object-motions|.
This filetype plugin attempts to translate these keys to maps which make sense
for the SQL language.

The following |Normal| mode and |Visual| mode maps exist (when you edit a SQL
file): >
    ]]		    move forward to the next 'begin'
    [[		    move backwards to the previous 'begin'
    ][		    move forward to the next 'end'
    []		    move backwards to the previous 'end'


1.3 Predefined Object Motions			*sql-predefined-objects*
-----------------------------
Most relational databases support various standard features, tables, indices,
triggers and stored procedures.  Each vendor also has a variety of proprietary
objects.  The next set of maps have been created to help move between these
objects.  Depends on which database vendor you are using, the list of objects
must be configurable.  The filetype plugin attempts to define many of the
standard objects, plus many additional ones.  In order to make this as
flexible as possible, you can override the list of objects from within your
|vimrc| with the following: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_objects = 'function,procedure,event,table,trigger' .
		\ ',schema,service,publication,database,datatype,domain' .
		\ ',index,subscription,synchronization,view,variable'

The following |Normal| mode and |Visual| mode maps have been created which use
the above list: >
    ]}		    move forward to the next 'create <object name>'
    [{		    move backward to the previous 'create <object name>'

Repeatedly pressing ]} will cycle through each of these create statements: >
    create table t1 (
	...
    );

    create procedure p1
    begin
	...
    end;

    create index i1 on t1 (c1);

The default setting for g:ftplugin_sql_objects is: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_objects = 'function,procedure,event,' .
		\ '\\(existing\\\\|global\\s\\+temporary\\s\\+\\)\\\{,1}' .
		\ 'table,trigger' .
		\ ',schema,service,publication,database,datatype,domain' .
		\ ',index,subscription,synchronization,view,variable'

The above will also handle these cases: >
    create table t1 (
	...
    );
    create existing table t2 (
	...
    );
    create global temporary table t3 (
	...
    );

By default, the ftplugin only searches for CREATE statements.  You can also
override this via your |vimrc| with the following: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_statements = 'create,alter'

The filetype plugin defines three types of comments: >
    1.  --
    2.  //
    3.  /*
	 *
	 */

The following |Normal| mode and |Visual| mode maps have been created to work
with comments: >
    ]"		    move forward to the beginning of a comment
    ["		    move forward to the end of a comment



1.4 Macros					   *sql-macros*
----------
Vim's feature to find macro definitions, |'define'|, is supported using this
regular expression: >
    \c\<\(VARIABLE\|DECLARE\|IN\|OUT\|INOUT\)\>

This addresses the following code: >
    CREATE VARIABLE myVar1 INTEGER;

    CREATE PROCEDURE sp_test(
	IN myVar2 INTEGER,
	OUT myVar3 CHAR(30),
	INOUT myVar4 NUMERIC(20,0)
    )
    BEGIN
	DECLARE myVar5 INTEGER;

	SELECT c1, c2, c3
	  INTO myVar2, myVar3, myVar4
	  FROM T1
	 WHERE c4 = myVar1;
    END;

Place your cursor on "myVar1" on this line: >
	 WHERE c4 = myVar1;
		     ^

Press any of the following keys: >
    [d
    [D
    [CTRL-D


==============================================================================
2. SQL Dialects					*sql-dialects* *sql-types*
						*sybase* *TSQL* *Transact-SQL*
						*sqlanywhere*
						*oracle* *plsql* *sqlj*
						*sqlserver*
						*mysql* *postgresql* *psql*
						*informix*

All relational databases support SQL.  There is a portion of SQL that is
portable across vendors (ex. CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX), but there is a
great deal of vendor specific extensions to SQL.  Oracle supports the
"CREATE OR REPLACE" syntax, column defaults specified in the CREATE TABLE
statement and the procedural language (for stored procedures and triggers).

The default Vim distribution ships with syntax highlighting based on Oracle's
PL/SQL.  The default SQL indent script works for Oracle and SQL Anywhere.
The default filetype plugin works for all vendors and should remain vendor
neutral, but extendable.

Vim currently has support for a variety of different vendors, currently this
is via syntax scripts. Unfortunately, to flip between different syntax rules
you must either create:
    1.  New filetypes
    2.  Custom autocmds
    3.  Manual steps / commands

The majority of people work with only one vendor's database product, it would
be nice to specify a default in your |vimrc|.


2.1 SQLSetType					*sqlsettype* *SQLSetType*
--------------
For the people that work with many different databases, it is nice to be
able to flip between the various vendors rules (indent, syntax) on a per
buffer basis, at any time.  The ftplugin/sql.vim file defines this function: >
    SQLSetType

Executing this function without any parameters will set the indent and syntax
scripts back to their defaults, see |sql-type-default|.  If you have turned
off Vi's compatibility mode, |'compatible'|, you can use the <Tab> key to
complete the optional parameter.

After typing the function name and a space, you can use the completion to
supply a parameter.  The function takes the name of the Vim script you want to
source.  Using the |cmdline-completion| feature, the SQLSetType function will
search the |'runtimepath'| for all Vim scripts with a name containing 'sql'.
This takes the guess work out of the spelling of the names.  The following are
examples: >
    :SQLSetType
    :SQLSetType sqloracle
    :SQLSetType sqlanywhere
    :SQLSetType sqlinformix
    :SQLSetType mysql

The easiest approach is to the use <Tab> character which will first complete
the command name (SQLSetType), after a space and another <Tab>, display a list
of available Vim script names: >
    :SQL<Tab><space><Tab>


2.2 SQLGetType					*sqlgettype* *SQLGetType*
--------------
At anytime you can determine which SQL dialect you are using by calling the
SQLGetType command.  The ftplugin/sql.vim file defines this function: >
    SQLGetType

This will echo: >
    Current SQL dialect in use:sqlanywhere


2.3 SQL Dialect Default				*sql-type-default*
-----------------------
As mentioned earlier, the default syntax rules for Vim is based on Oracle
(PL/SQL).  You can override this default by placing one of the following in
your |vimrc|: >
    let g:sql_type_default = 'sqlanywhere'
    let g:sql_type_default = 'sqlinformix'
    let g:sql_type_default = 'mysql'

If you added the following to your |vimrc|: >
    let g:sql_type_default = 'sqlinformix'

The next time edit a SQL file the following scripts will be automatically
loaded by Vim: >
    ftplugin/sql.vim
    syntax/sqlinformix.vim
    indent/sql.vim
>
Notice indent/sqlinformix.sql was not loaded.  There is no indent file
for Informix, Vim loads the default files if the specified files does not
exist.


==============================================================================
3. Adding new SQL Dialects			*sql-adding-dialects*

If you begin working with a SQL dialect which does not have any customizations
available with the default Vim distribution you can check http://www.vim.org
to see if any customization currently exist.  If not, you can begin by cloning
an existing script.  Read |filetype-plugins| for more details.

To help identify these scripts, try to create the files with a "sql" prefix.
If you decide you wish to create customizations for the SQLite database, you
can create any of the following: >
    Unix
	~/.vim/syntax/sqlite.vim
	~/.vim/indent/sqlite.vim
    Windows
	$VIM/vimfiles/syntax/sqlite.vim
	$VIM/vimfiles/indent/sqlite.vim

No changes are necessary to the SQLSetType function.  It will automatically
pickup the new SQL files and load them when you issue the SQLSetType command.


==============================================================================
4. OMNI SQL Completion				*sql-completion*
						*omni-sql-completion*

Vim 7 includes a code completion interface and functions which allows plugin
developers to build in code completion for any language.  Vim 7 includes
code completion for the SQL language.

There are two modes to the SQL completion plugin, static and dynamic.  The
static mode populates the popups with the data generated from current syntax
highlight rules.  The dynamic mode populates the popups with data retrieved
directly from a database.  This includes, table lists, column lists,
procedures names and more.

4.1 Static Mode					*sql-completion-static*
---------------
The static popups created contain items defined by the active syntax rules
while editing a file with a filetype of SQL.  The plugin defines (by default)
various maps to help the user refine the list of items to be displayed.
The defaults static maps are: >
    imap <buffer> <C-C>a <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('syntax')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>k <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlKeyword')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>f <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlFunction')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>o <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlOption')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>T <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlType')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>s <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlStatement')<CR><C-X><C-O>

The use of "<C-C>" can be user chosen by using the following in your |.vimrc| as it 
may not work properly on all platforms: >
    let g:ftplugin_sql_omni_key = '<C-C>'
>
The static maps (which are based on the syntax highlight groups) follow this
format: >
    imap <buffer> <C-C>k <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlKeyword')<CR><C-X><C-O>
    imap <buffer> <C-C>k <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('sqlKeyword\w*')<CR><C-X><C-O>

This command breaks down as: >
    imap		   - Create an insert map
    <buffer>		   - Only for this buffer
    <C-C>k		   - Your choice of key map
    <C-\><C-O>		   - Execute one command, return to Insert mode
    :call sqlcomplete#Map( - Allows the SQL completion plugin to perform some
			     housekeeping functions to allow it to be used in
			     conjunction with other completion plugins.
			     Indicate which item you want the SQL completion
			     plugin to complete.
			     In this case we are asking the plugin to display
			     items from the syntax highlight group
			     'sqlKeyword'.
			     You can view a list of highlight group names to
			     choose from by executing the
				 :syntax list
			     command while editing a SQL file.
    'sqlKeyword'	   - Display the items for the sqlKeyword highlight
			     group
    'sqlKeyword\w*'	   - A second option available with Vim 7.4 which
                             uses a regular expression to determine which
			     syntax groups to use
    )<CR>		   - Execute the :let command
    <C-X><C-O>		   - Trigger the standard omni completion key stroke.
			     Passing in 'sqlKeyword' instructs the SQL
			     completion plugin to populate the popup with
			     items from the sqlKeyword highlight group.  The
			     plugin will also cache this result until Vim is
			     restarted.  The syntax list is retrieved using
			     the syntaxcomplete plugin.

Using the 'syntax' keyword is a special case.  This instructs the
syntaxcomplete plugin to retrieve all syntax items.  So this will effectively
work for any of Vim's SQL syntax files.  At the time of writing this includes
10 different syntax files for the different dialects of SQL (see section 3
above, |sql-dialects|).

Here are some examples of the entries which are pulled from the syntax files: >
     All
	 - Contains the contents of all syntax highlight groups
     Statements
	 - Select, Insert, Update, Delete, Create, Alter, ...
     Functions
	 - Min, Max, Trim, Round, Date, ...
     Keywords
	 - Index, Database, Having, Group, With
     Options
	 - Isolation_level, On_error, Qualify_owners, Fire_triggers, ...
     Types
	 - Integer, Char, Varchar, Date, DateTime, Timestamp, ...


4.2 Dynamic Mode				*sql-completion-dynamic*
----------------
Dynamic mode populates the popups with data directly from a database.  In
order for the dynamic feature to be enabled you must have the dbext.vim
plugin installed, (http://vim.sourceforge.net/script.php?script_id=356).

Dynamic mode is used by several features of the SQL completion plugin.
After installing the dbext plugin see the dbext-tutorial for additional
configuration and usage.  The dbext plugin allows the SQL completion plugin
to display a list of tables, procedures, views and columns. >
     Table List
	 - All tables for all schema owners
     Procedure List
	 - All stored procedures for all schema owners
     View List
	 - All stored procedures for all schema owners
     Column List
	 - For the selected table, the columns that are part of the table

To enable the popup, while in INSERT mode, use the following key combinations
for each group (where <C-C> means hold the CTRL key down while pressing
the space bar):
     Table List		   - <C-C>t
			   - <C-X><C-O> (the default map assumes tables)
     Stored Procedure List - <C-C>p
     View List		   - <C-C>v
     Column List	   - <C-C>c

     Drilling In / Out     - When viewing a popup window displaying the list
			     of tables, you can press <Right>, this will
			     replace the table currently highlighted with
			     the column list for that table.
			   - When viewing a popup window displaying the list
			     of columns, you can press <Left>, this will
			     replace the column list with the list of tables.
			   - This allows you to quickly drill down into a
			     table to view its columns and back again.
			   - <Right> and <Left> can be also be chosen via
			     your |.vimrc| >
                                let g:ftplugin_sql_omni_key_right = '<Right>'
                                let g:ftplugin_sql_omni_key_left  = '<Left>'

The SQL completion plugin caches various lists that are displayed in
the popup window.  This makes the re-displaying of these lists very
fast.  If new tables or columns are added to the database it may become
necessary to clear the plugins cache.  The default map for this is: >
    imap <buffer> <C-C>R <C-\><C-O>:call sqlcomplete#Map('ResetCache')<CR><C-X><C-O>


4.3 SQL Tutorial				*sql-completion-tutorial*
----------------

This tutorial is designed to take you through the common features of the SQL
completion plugin so that: >
     a) You gain familiarity with the plugin
     b) You are introduced to some of the more common features
     c) Show how to customize it to your preferences
     d) Demonstrate "Best of Use" of the plugin (easiest way to configure).

First, create a new buffer: >
     :e tutorial.sql


Static features
---------------
To take you through the various lists, simply enter insert mode, hit:
    <C-C>s   (show SQL statements)
At this point, you can page down through the list until you find "select".
If you are familiar with the item you are looking for, for example you know
the statement begins with the letter "s".  You can type ahead (without the
quotes) "se" then press:
    <C-Space>t
Assuming "select" is highlighted in the popup list press <Enter> to choose
the entry.  Now type:
    * fr<C-C>a (show all syntax items)
choose "from" from the popup list.

When writing stored procedures using the "type" list is useful.  It contains
a list of all the database supported types.  This may or may not be true
depending on the syntax file you are using.  The SQL Anywhere syntax file
(sqlanywhere.vim) has support for this: >
     BEGIN
	DECLARE customer_id <C-C>T <-- Choose a type from the list


Dynamic features
----------------
To take advantage of the dynamic features you must first install the
dbext.vim plugin (http://vim.sourceforge.net/script.php?script_id=356).  It
also comes with a tutorial.  From the SQL completion plugin's perspective,
the main feature dbext provides is a connection to a database.  dbext
connection profiles are the most efficient mechanism to define connection
information.  Once connections have been setup, the SQL completion plugin
uses the features of dbext in the background to populate the popups.

What follows assumes dbext.vim has been correctly configured, a simple test
is to run the command, :DBListTable.  If a list of tables is shown, you know
dbext.vim is working as expected.  If not, please consult the dbext.txt
documentation.

Assuming you have followed the dbext-tutorial you can press <C-C>t to
display a list of tables.  There is a delay while dbext is creating the table
list.  After the list is displayed press <C-W>.  This will remove both the
popup window and the table name already chosen when the list became active. >

 4.3.1 Table Completion:			*sql-completion-tables*

Press <C-C>t to display a list of tables from within the database you
have connected via the dbext plugin.
NOTE: All of the SQL completion popups support typing a prefix before pressing
the key map.  This will limit the contents of the popup window to just items
beginning with those characters.  >

 4.3.2 Column Completion:			*sql-completion-columns*

The SQL completion plugin can also display a list of columns for particular
tables.  The column completion is trigger via <C-C>c.

NOTE: The following example uses <Right> to trigger a column list while
      the popup window is active.  

Example of using column completion:
     - Press <C-C>t again to display the list of tables.
     - When the list is displayed in the completion window, press <Right>,
       this will replace the list of tables, with a list of columns for the
       table highlighted (after the same short delay).
     - If you press <Left>, this will again replace the column list with the
       list of tables.  This allows you to drill into tables and column lists
       very quickly.
     - Press <Right> again while the same table is highlighted.  You will
       notice there is no delay since the column list has been cached.  If you
       change the schema of a cached table you can press <C-C>R, which
       clears the SQL completion cache.
     - NOTE: <Right> and <Left> have been designed to work while the
       completion window is active.  If the completion popup window is
       not active, a normal <Right> or <Left> will be executed.

Let's look at how we can build a SQL statement dynamically.  A select statement
requires a list of columns.  There are two ways to build a column list using
the SQL completion plugin. >
    One column at a time:
<       1. After typing SELECT press <C-C>t to display a list of tables.
	2. Choose a table from the list.
	3. Press <Right> to display a list of columns.
	4. Choose the column from the list and press enter.
	5. Enter a "," and press <C-C>c.  Generating a column list
	   generally requires having the cursor on a table name.  The plugin
	   uses this name to determine what table to retrieve the column list.
	   In this step, since we are pressing <C-C>c without the cursor
	   on a table name the column list displayed will be for the previous
	   table.  Choose a different column and move on.
	6. Repeat step 5 as often as necessary. >
    All columns for a table:
<	1. After typing SELECT press <C-C>t to display a list of tables.
	2. Highlight the table you need the column list for.
	3. Press <Enter> to choose the table from the list.
	4. Press <C-C>l to request a comma separated list of all columns
	   for this table.
	5. Based on the table name chosen in step 3, the plugin attempts to
	   decide on a reasonable table alias.	You are then prompted to
	   either accept of change the alias.  Press OK.
	6. The table name is replaced with the column list of the table is
	   replaced with the comma separate list of columns with the alias
	   prepended to each of the columns.
	7. Step 3 and 4 can be replaced by pressing <C-C>L, which has
	   a <C-Y> embedded in the map to choose the currently highlighted
	   table in the list.

There is a special provision when writing select statements.  Consider the
following statement: >
     select *
       from customer c,
	    contact cn,
	    department as dp,
	    employee e,
	    site_options so
      where c.

In INSERT mode after typing the final "c." which is an alias for the
"customer" table, you can press either <C-C>c or <C-X><C-O>.  This will
popup a list of columns for the customer table.  It does this by looking back
to the beginning of the select statement and finding a list of the tables
specified in the FROM clause.  In this case it notes that in the string
"customer c", "c" is an alias for the customer table.  The optional "AS"
keyword is also supported, "customer AS c". >


 4.3.3 Procedure Completion:			*sql-completion-procedures*

Similar to the table list, <C-C>p, will display a list of stored
procedures stored within the database. >

 4.3.4 View Completion:				*sql-completion-views*

Similar to the table list, <C-C>v, will display a list of views in the
database.


4.4 Completion Customization			*sql-completion-customization*
----------------------------

The SQL completion plugin can be customized through various options set in
your |vimrc|: >
    omni_sql_no_default_maps
<       - Default: This variable is not defined
	- If this variable is defined, no maps are created for OMNI
	  completion.  See |sql-completion-maps| for further discussion.
>
    omni_sql_use_tbl_alias
<	- Default: a
	- This setting is only used when generating a comma separated
	  column list.	By default the map is <C-C>l.  When generating
	  a column list, an alias can be prepended to the beginning of each
	  column, for example:	e.emp_id, e.emp_name.  This option has three
	  settings: >
		n - do not use an alias
		d - use the default (calculated) alias
		a - ask to confirm the alias name
<
	  An alias is determined following a few rules:
	       1.  If the table name has an '_', then use it as a separator: >
		   MY_TABLE_NAME --> MTN
		   my_table_name --> mtn
		   My_table_NAME --> MtN
<	       2.  If the table name does NOT contain an '_', but DOES use
		   mixed case then the case is used as a separator: >
		   MyTableName --> MTN
<	       3.  If the table name does NOT contain an '_', and does NOT
		   use mixed case then the first letter of the table is used: >
		   mytablename --> m
		   MYTABLENAME --> M

    omni_sql_ignorecase
<	- Default: Current setting for 'ignorecase'
	- Valid settings are 0 or 1.
	- When entering a few letters before initiating completion, the list
	  will be filtered to display only the entries which begin with the
	  list of characters.  When this option is set to 0, the list will be
	  filtered using case sensitivity. >

    omni_sql_include_owner
<	- Default: 0, unless dbext.vim 3.00 has been installed
	- Valid settings are 0 or 1.
	- When completing tables, procedure or views and using dbext.vim 3.00
	  or higher the list of objects will also include the owner name.
	  When completing these objects and omni_sql_include_owner is enabled
	  the owner name will be replaced. >

    omni_sql_precache_syntax_groups
<	- Default:
	  ['syntax','sqlKeyword','sqlFunction','sqlOption','sqlType','sqlStatement']
	- sqlcomplete can be used in conjunction with other completion
	  plugins.  This is outlined at |sql-completion-filetypes|.  When the
	  filetype is changed temporarily to SQL, the sqlcompletion plugin
	  will cache the syntax groups listed in the List specified in this
	  option.
>

4.5 SQL Maps					*sql-completion-maps*
------------

The default SQL maps have been described in other sections of this document in
greater detail.  Here is a list of the maps with a brief description of each.

Static Maps
-----------
These are maps which use populate the completion list using Vim's syntax
highlighting rules. >
    <C-C>a
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items. >
    <C-C>k
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlKeyword'. >
    <C-C>f
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlFunction. >
    <C-C>o
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlOption'. >
    <C-C>T
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlType'. >
    <C-C>s
<       - Displays all SQL syntax items defined as 'sqlStatement'. >

Dynamic Maps
------------
These are maps which use populate the completion list using the dbext.vim
plugin. >
    <C-C>t
<       - Displays a list of tables. >
    <C-C>p
<       - Displays a list of procedures. >
    <C-C>v
<       - Displays a list of views. >
    <C-C>c
<       - Displays a list of columns for a specific table. >
    <C-C>l
<       - Displays a comma separated list of columns for a specific table. >
    <C-C>L
<       - Displays a comma separated list of columns for a specific table.
	  This should only be used when the completion window is active. >
    <Right>
<	- Displays a list of columns for the table currently highlighted in
	  the completion window.  <Right> is not recognized on most Unix
	  systems, so this maps is only created on the Windows platform.
	  If you would like the same feature on Unix, choose a different key
	  and make the same map in your vimrc. >
    <Left>
<	- Displays the list of tables.
	  <Left> is not recognized on most Unix systems, so this maps is
	  only created on the Windows platform.  If you would like the same
	  feature on Unix, choose a different key and make the same map in
	  your vimrc. >
    <C-C>R
<	- This maps removes all cached items and forces the SQL completion
	  to regenerate the list of items.

Customizing Maps
----------------
You can create as many additional key maps as you like.  Generally, the maps
will be specifying different syntax highlight groups.

If you do not wish the default maps created or the key choices do not work on
your platform (often a case on *nix) you define the following variable in
your |vimrc|: >
    let g:omni_sql_no_default_maps = 1

Do no edit ftplugin/sql.vim directly!  If you change this file your changes
will be over written on future updates.  Vim has a special directory structure
which allows you to make customizations without changing the files that are
included with the Vim distribution.  If you wish to customize the maps
create an after/ftplugin/sql.vim (see |after-directory|) and place the same
maps from the ftplugin/sql.vim in it using your own key strokes.  <C-C> was
chosen since it will work on both Windows and *nix platforms.  On the windows
platform you can also use <C-Space> or ALT keys.


4.6 Using with other filetypes			*sql-completion-filetypes*
------------------------------

Many times SQL can be used with different filetypes.  For example Perl, Java,
PHP, Javascript can all interact with a database.  Often you need both the SQL
completion and the completion capabilities for the current language you are
editing.

This can be enabled easily with the following steps (assuming a Perl file): >
    1.  :e test.pl
    2.  :set filetype=sql
    3.  :set ft=perl

Step 1
------
Begins by editing a Perl file.  Vim automatically sets the filetype to
"perl".  By default, Vim runs the appropriate filetype file
ftplugin/perl.vim.  If you are using the syntax completion plugin by following
the directions at |ft-syntax-omni| then the |'omnifunc'| option has been set to
"syntax#Complete".  Pressing <C-X><C-O> will display the omni popup containing
the syntax items for Perl.

Step 2
------
Manually setting the filetype to 'sql' will also fire the appropriate filetype
files ftplugin/sql.vim.  This file will define a number of buffer specific
maps for SQL completion, see |sql-completion-maps|.  Now these maps have
been created and the SQL completion plugin has been initialized.  All SQL
syntax items have been cached in preparation.  The SQL filetype script detects
we are attempting to use two different completion plugins.  Since the SQL maps
begin with <C-C>, the maps will toggle the |'omnifunc'| when in use.  So you
can use <C-X><C-O> to continue using the completion for Perl (using the syntax
completion plugin) and <C-C> to use the SQL completion features.

Step 3
------
Setting the filetype back to Perl sets all the usual "perl" related items back

Vim's Graphical User Interface				*gui* *GUI*

1. Starting the GUI		|gui-start|
2. Scrollbars			|gui-scrollbars|
3. Mouse Control		|gui-mouse|
4. Making GUI Selections	|gui-selections|
5. Menus			|menus|
6. Extras			|gui-extras|
7. Shell Commands		|gui-shell|

Other GUI documentation:
|gui_x11.txt|	For specific items of the X11 GUI.
|gui_w32.txt|	For specific items of the Win32 GUI.

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Starting the GUI				*gui-start* *E229* *E233*

First you must make sure you actually have a version of Vim with the GUI code
included.  You can check this with the ":version" command, it says "with xxx
GUI", where "xxx" is X11-Motif, X11-Athena, Photon, GTK2, GTK3, etc., or
"MS-Windows 32 bit GUI version".

How to start the GUI depends on the system used.  Mostly you can run the
GUI version of Vim with:
    gvim [options] [files...]

The X11 version of Vim can run both in GUI and in non-GUI mode.  See
|gui-x11-start|.

			*gui-init* *gvimrc* *.gvimrc* *_gvimrc* *$MYGVIMRC*
The gvimrc file is where GUI-specific startup commands should be placed.  It
is always sourced after the |vimrc| file.  If you have one then the $MYGVIMRC
environment variable has its name.

When the GUI starts up initializations are carried out, in this order:
- The 'term' option is set to "builtin_gui" and terminal options are reset to
  their default value for the GUI |terminal-options|.
- If the system menu file exists, it is sourced.  The name of this file is
  normally "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim".  You can check this with ":version".  Also
  see |$VIMRUNTIME|.  To skip loading the system menu include 'M' in
  'guioptions'.				*buffers-menu* *no_buffers_menu*
  The system menu file includes a "Buffers" menu.  If you don't want this, set
  the "no_buffers_menu" variable in your .vimrc (not .gvimrc!): >
	:let no_buffers_menu = 1
< NOTE: Switching on syntax highlighting also loads the menu file, thus
  disabling the Buffers menu must be done before ":syntax on".
  The path names are truncated to 35 characters.  You can truncate them at a
  different length, for example 50, like this: >
	:let bmenu_max_pathlen = 50
- If the "-U {gvimrc}" command-line option has been used when starting Vim,
  the {gvimrc} file will be read for initializations.  The following
  initializations are skipped.  When {gvimrc} is "NONE" no file will be read
  for initializations.
- For Unix and MS-Windows, if the system gvimrc exists, it is sourced.  The
  name of this file is normally "$VIM/gvimrc".  You can check this with
  ":version".  Also see |$VIM|.
- The following are tried, and only the first one that exists is used:
  - If the GVIMINIT environment variable exists and is not empty, it is
    executed as an Ex command.
  - If the user gvimrc file exists, it is sourced.  The name of this file is
    normally "$HOME/.gvimrc".  You can check this with ":version".
  - For Win32, when $HOME is not set, "$VIM\_gvimrc" is used.
  - When a "_gvimrc" file is not found, ".gvimrc" is tried too.  And vice
    versa.
  The name of the first file found is stored in $MYGVIMRC, unless it was
  already set.
- If the 'exrc' option is set (which is NOT the default) the file ./.gvimrc
  is sourced, if it exists and isn't the same file as the system or user
  gvimrc file.  If this file is not owned by you, some security restrictions
  apply.  When ".gvimrc" is not found, "_gvimrc" is tried too.  For Macintosh
  and DOS/Win32 "_gvimrc" is tried first.

NOTE: All but the first one are not carried out if Vim was started with
"-u NONE" and no "-U" argument was given, or when started with "-U NONE".

All this happens AFTER the normal Vim initializations, like reading your
.vimrc file.  See |initialization|.
But the GUI window is only opened after all the initializations have been
carried out.  If you want some commands to be executed just after opening the
GUI window, use the |GUIEnter| autocommand event.  Example: >
	:autocmd GUIEnter * winpos 100 50

You can use the gvimrc files to set up your own customized menus (see |:menu|)
and initialize other things that you may want to set up differently from the
terminal version.

Recommended place for your personal GUI initializations:
	Unix		    $HOME/.gvimrc or $HOME/.vim/gvimrc
	OS/2		    $HOME/.gvimrc, $HOME/vimfiles/gvimrc
			    or $VIM/.gvimrc
	MS-DOS and Win32    $HOME/_gvimrc, $HOME/vimfiles/gvimrc
			    or $VIM/_gvimrc
	Amiga		    s:.gvimrc, home:.gvimrc, home:vimfiles:gvimrc
			    or $VIM/.gvimrc

The personal initialization files are searched in the order specified above
and only the first one that is found is read.

There are a number of options which only have meaning in the GUI version of
Vim.  These are 'guicursor', 'guifont', 'guipty' and 'guioptions'.  They are
documented in |options.txt| with all the other options.

If using the Motif or Athena version of the GUI (but not for the GTK+ or
Win32 version), a number of X resources are available.  See |gui-resources|.

Another way to set the colors for different occasions is with highlight
groups.  The "Normal" group is used to set the background and foreground
colors.  Example (which looks nice): >

	:highlight Normal guibg=grey90

The "guibg" and "guifg" settings override the normal background and
foreground settings.  The other settings for the Normal highlight group are
not used.  Use the 'guifont' option to set the font.

Also check out the 'guicursor' option, to set the colors for the cursor in
various modes.

Vim tries to make the window fit on the screen when it starts up.  This avoids
that you can't see part of it.  On the X Window System this requires a bit of
guesswork.  You can change the height that is used for the window title and a
task bar with the 'guiheadroom' option.

						*:winp* *:winpos* *E188*
:winp[os]
		Display current position of the top left corner of the GUI vim
		window in pixels.  Does not work in all versions.
		Also see |getwinposx()| and |getwinposy()|.

:winp[os] {X} {Y}							*E466*
		Put the GUI vim window at the given {X} and {Y} coordinates.
		The coordinates should specify the position in pixels of the
		top left corner of the window.  Does not work in all versions.
		Does work in an (new) xterm |xterm-color|.
		When the GUI window has not been opened yet, the values are
		remembered until the window is opened.  The position is
		adjusted to make the window fit on the screen (if possible).

						    *:win* *:winsize* *E465*
:win[size] {width} {height}
		Set the window height to {width} by {height} characters.
		Obsolete, use ":set lines=11 columns=22".
		If you get less lines than expected, check the 'guiheadroom'
		option.

If you are running the X Window System, you can get information about the
window Vim is running in with these commands: >
	:!xwininfo -id $WINDOWID
	:!xprop -id $WINDOWID
	:execute '!xwininfo -id ' . v:windowid
	:execute '!xprop -id ' . v:windowid
<
							*gui-IME* *iBus*
Input methods for international characters in X that rely on the XIM
framework, most notably iBus, have been known to produce undesirable results
in gVim. These may include an inability to enter spaces, or long delays
between typing a character and it being recognized by the application.

One workaround that has been successful, for unknown reasons, is to prevent
gvim from forking into the background by starting it with the |-f| argument.

==============================================================================
2. Scrollbars						*gui-scrollbars*

There are vertical scrollbars and a horizontal scrollbar.  You may
configure which ones appear with the 'guioptions' option.

The interface looks like this (with ":set guioptions=mlrb"):

		       +------------------------------+ `
		       | File  Edit		 Help | <- Menu bar (m) `
		       +-+--------------------------+-+ `
		       |^|			    |^| `
		       |#| Text area.		    |#| `
		       | |			    | | `
		       |v|__________________________|v| `
 Normal status line -> |-+ File.c	       5,2  +-| `
 between Vim windows   |^|""""""""""""""""""""""""""|^| `
		       | |			    | | `
		       | | Another file buffer.     | | `
		       | |			    | | `
		       |#|			    |#| `
 Left scrollbar (l) -> |#|			    |#| <- Right `
		       |#|			    |#|    scrollbar (r) `
		       | |			    | | `
		       |v|			    |v| `
		       +-+--------------------------+-+ `
		       | |< ####		   >| | <- Bottom `
		       +-+--------------------------+-+    scrollbar (b) `

Any of the scrollbar or menu components may be turned off by not putting the
appropriate letter in the 'guioptions' string.  The bottom scrollbar is
only useful when 'nowrap' is set.


VERTICAL SCROLLBARS					*gui-vert-scroll*

Each Vim window has a scrollbar next to it which may be scrolled up and down
to move through the text in that buffer.  The size of the scrollbar-thumb
indicates the fraction of the buffer which can be seen in the window.
When the scrollbar is dragged all the way down, the last line of the file
will appear in the top of the window.

If a window is shrunk to zero height (by the growth of another window) its
scrollbar disappears.  It reappears when the window is restored.

If a window is vertically split, it will get a scrollbar when it is the
current window and when, taking the middle of the current window and drawing a
vertical line, this line goes through the window.
When there are scrollbars on both sides, and the middle of the current window
is on the left half, the right scrollbar column will contain scrollbars for
the rightmost windows.  The same happens on the other side.


HORIZONTAL SCROLLBARS					*gui-horiz-scroll*

The horizontal scrollbar (at the bottom of the Vim GUI) may be used to
scroll text sideways when the 'wrap' option is turned off.  The
scrollbar-thumb size is such that the text of the longest visible line may be
scrolled as far as possible left and right.  The cursor is moved when
necessary, it must remain on a visible character (unless 'virtualedit' is
set).

Computing the length of the longest visible line takes quite a bit of
computation, and it has to be done every time something changes.  If this
takes too much time or you don't like the cursor jumping to another line,
include the 'h' flag in 'guioptions'.  Then the scrolling is limited by the
text of the current cursor line.

							*athena-intellimouse*
If you have an Intellimouse and an X server that supports using the wheel,
then you can use the wheel to scroll the text up and down in gvim.  This works
with XFree86 4.0 and later, and with some older versions when you add patches.
See |scroll-mouse-wheel|.

For older versions of XFree86 you must patch your X server.  The following
page has a bit of information about using the Intellimouse on Linux as well as
links to the patches and X server binaries (may not have the one you need
though):
    http://www.inria.fr/koala/colas/mouse-wheel-scroll/

==============================================================================
3. Mouse Control					*gui-mouse*

The mouse only works if the appropriate flag in the 'mouse' option is set.
When the GUI is switched on, and 'mouse' wasn't set yet, the 'mouse' option is
automatically set to "a", enabling it for all modes except for the
|hit-enter| prompt.  If you don't want this, a good place to change the
'mouse' option is the "gvimrc" file.

Other options that are relevant:
'mousefocus'	window focus follows mouse pointer |gui-mouse-focus|
'mousemodel'	what mouse button does which action
'mousehide'	hide mouse pointer while typing text
'selectmode'	whether to start Select mode or Visual mode

A quick way to set these is with the ":behave" command.
							*:behave* *:be*
:be[have] {model}	Set behavior for mouse and selection.  Valid
			arguments are:
			   mswin	MS-Windows behavior
			   xterm	Xterm behavior

			Using ":behave" changes these options:
			option		mswin			xterm	~
			'selectmode'	"mouse,key"		""
			'mousemodel'	"popup"			"extend"
			'keymodel'	"startsel,stopsel"	""
			'selection'	"exclusive"		"inclusive"

In the $VIMRUNTIME directory, there is a script called |mswin.vim|, which will
also map a few keys to the MS-Windows cut/copy/paste commands.  This is NOT
compatible, since it uses the CTRL-V, CTRL-X and CTRL-C keys.  If you don't
mind, use this command: >
	:so $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim

For scrolling with a wheel on a mouse, see |scroll-mouse-wheel|.


3.1 Moving Cursor with Mouse				*gui-mouse-move*

Click the left mouse button somewhere in a text buffer where you want the
cursor to go, and it does!
This works in	    when 'mouse' contains ~
Normal mode	    'n' or 'a'
Visual mode	    'v' or 'a'
Insert mode	    'i' or 'a'

Select mode is handled like Visual mode.

You may use this with an operator such as 'd' to delete text from the current
cursor position to the position you point to with the mouse.  That is, you hit
'd' and then click the mouse somewhere.

							*gui-mouse-focus*
The 'mousefocus' option can be set to make the keyboard focus follow the
mouse pointer.  This means that the window where the mouse pointer is, is the
active window.  Warning: this doesn't work very well when using a menu,
because the menu command will always be applied to the top window.

If you are on the ':' line (or '/' or '?'), then clicking the left or right
mouse button will position the cursor on the ':' line (if 'mouse' contains
'c', 'a' or 'A').

In any situation the middle mouse button may be clicked to paste the current
selection.


3.2 Selection with Mouse				*gui-mouse-select*

The mouse can be used to start a selection.  How depends on the 'mousemodel'
option:
'mousemodel' is "extend": use the right mouse button
'mousemodel' is "popup":  use the left mouse button, while keeping the Shift
key pressed.

If there was no selection yet, this starts a selection from the old cursor
position to the position pointed to with the mouse.  If there already is a
selection then the closest end will be extended.

If 'selectmode' contains "mouse", then the selection will be in Select mode.
This means that typing normal text will replace the selection.  See
|Select-mode|.  Otherwise, the selection will be in Visual mode.

Double clicking may be done to make the selection word-wise, triple clicking
makes it line-wise, and quadruple clicking makes it rectangular block-wise.

See |gui-selections| on how the selection is used.


3.3 Other Text Selection with Mouse		*gui-mouse-modeless*
						*modeless-selection*
A different kind of selection is used when:
- in Command-line mode
- in the Command-line window and pointing in another window
- at the |hit-enter| prompt
- whenever the current mode is not in the 'mouse' option
- when holding the CTRL and SHIFT keys in the GUI

Since Vim continues like the selection isn't there, and there is no mode
associated with the selection, this is called modeless selection.  Any text in
the Vim window can be selected.  Select the text by pressing the left mouse
button at the start, drag to the end and release.  To extend the selection,
use the right mouse button when 'mousemodel' is "extend", or the left mouse
button with the shift key pressed when 'mousemodel' is "popup".
The selection is removed when the selected text is scrolled or changed.

On the command line CTRL-Y can be used to copy the selection into the
clipboard.  To do this from Insert mode, use CTRL-O : CTRL-Y <CR>.  When
'guioptions' contains a or A (default on X11), the selection is automatically
copied to the "* register.

The middle mouse button can then paste the text.  On non-X11 systems, you can
use CTRL-R +.


3.4 Using Mouse on Status Lines				*gui-mouse-status*

Clicking the left or right mouse button on the status line below a Vim
window makes that window the current window.  This actually happens on button
release (to be able to distinguish a click from a drag action).

With the left mouse button a status line can be dragged up and down, thus
resizing the windows above and below it.  This does not change window focus.

The same can be used on the vertical separator: click to give the window left
of it focus, drag left and right to make windows wider and narrower.


3.5 Various Mouse Clicks				*gui-mouse-various*

    <S-LeftMouse>	Search forward for the word under the mouse click.
			When 'mousemodel' is "popup" this starts or extends a
			selection.
    <S-RightMouse>	Search backward for the word under the mouse click.
    <C-LeftMouse>	Jump to the tag name under the mouse click.
    <C-RightMouse>	Jump back to position before the previous tag jump
			(same as "CTRL-T")


3.6 Mouse Mappings					*gui-mouse-mapping*

The mouse events, complete with modifiers, may be mapped.  Eg: >
   :map <S-LeftMouse>     <RightMouse>
   :map <S-LeftDrag>      <RightDrag>
   :map <S-LeftRelease>   <RightRelease>
   :map <2-S-LeftMouse>   <2-RightMouse>
   :map <2-S-LeftDrag>    <2-RightDrag>
   :map <2-S-LeftRelease> <2-RightRelease>
   :map <3-S-LeftMouse>   <3-RightMouse>
   :map <3-S-LeftDrag>    <3-RightDrag>
   :map <3-S-LeftRelease> <3-RightRelease>
   :map <4-S-LeftMouse>   <4-RightMouse>
   :map <4-S-LeftDrag>    <4-RightDrag>
   :map <4-S-LeftRelease> <4-RightRelease>
These mappings make selection work the way it probably should in a Motif
application, with shift-left mouse allowing for extending the visual area
rather than the right mouse button.

Mouse mapping with modifiers does not work for modeless selection.


3.7 Drag and drop						*drag-n-drop*

You can drag and drop one or more files into the Vim window, where they will
be opened as if a |:drop| command was used.

If you hold down Shift while doing this, Vim changes to the first dropped
file's directory.  If you hold Ctrl Vim will always split a new window for the
file.  Otherwise it's only done if the current buffer has been changed.

You can also drop a directory on Vim.  This starts the explorer plugin for
that directory (assuming it was enabled, otherwise you'll get an error
message).  Keep Shift pressed to change to the directory instead.

If Vim happens to be editing a command line, the names of the dropped files
and directories will be inserted at the cursor.  This allows you to use these
names with any Ex command.  Special characters (space, tab, double quote and
'|'; backslash on non-MS-Windows systems) will be escaped.

==============================================================================
4. Making GUI Selections				*gui-selections*

							*quotestar*
You may make selections with the mouse (see |gui-mouse-select|), or by using
Vim's Visual mode (see |v|).  If 'a' is present in 'guioptions', then
whenever a selection is started (Visual or Select mode), or when the selection
is changed, Vim becomes the owner of the windowing system's primary selection
(on MS-Windows the |gui-clipboard| is used; under X11, the |x11-selection| is
used - you should read whichever of these is appropriate now).

							*clipboard*
There is a special register for storing this selection, it is the "*
register.  Nothing is put in here unless the information about what text is
selected is about to change (e.g. with a left mouse click somewhere), or when
another application wants to paste the selected text.  Then the text is put
in the "* register.  For example, to cut a line and make it the current
selection/put it on the clipboard: >

	"*dd

Similarly, when you want to paste a selection from another application, e.g.,
by clicking the middle mouse button, the selection is put in the "* register
first, and then 'put' like any other register.  For example, to put the
selection (contents of the clipboard): >

	"*p

When using this register under X11, also see |x11-selection|.  This also
explains the related "+ register.

Note that when pasting text from one Vim into another separate Vim, the type
of selection (character, line, or block) will also be copied.  For other
applications the type is always character.  However, if the text gets
transferred via the |x11-cut-buffer|, the selection type is ALWAYS lost.

When the "unnamed" string is included in the 'clipboard' option, the unnamed
register is the same as the "* register.  Thus you can yank to and paste the
selection without prepending "* to commands.

5. Menus						*menus*

For an introduction see |usr_42.txt| in the user manual.


5.1 Using Menus						*using-menus*

Basically, menus can be used just like mappings.  You can define your own
menus, as many as you like.
Long-time Vim users won't use menus much.  But the power is in adding your own
menus and menu items.  They are most useful for things that you can't remember
what the key sequence was.

For creating menus in a different language, see |:menutrans|.

							*menu.vim*
The default menus are read from the file "$VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim".  See
|$VIMRUNTIME| for where the path comes from.  You can set up your own menus.
Starting off with the default set is a good idea.  You can add more items, or,
if you don't like the defaults at all, start with removing all menus
|:unmenu-all|.  You can also avoid the default menus being loaded by adding
this line to your .vimrc file (NOT your .gvimrc file!): >
	:let did_install_default_menus = 1
If you also want to avoid the Syntax menu: >
	:let did_install_syntax_menu = 1
The first item in the Syntax menu can be used to show all available filetypes
in the menu (which can take a bit of time to load).  If you want to have all
filetypes already present at startup, add: >
	:let do_syntax_sel_menu = 1

<
							*console-menus*
Although this documentation is in the GUI section, you can actually use menus
in console mode too.  You will have to load |menu.vim| explicitly then, it is
not done by default.  You can use the |:emenu| command and command-line
completion with 'wildmenu' to access the menu entries almost like a real menu
system.  To do this, put these commands in your .vimrc file: >
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
	:set wildmenu
	:set cpo-=<
	:set wcm=<C-Z>
	:map <F4> :emenu <C-Z>
Pressing <F4> will start the menu.  You can now use the cursor keys to select
a menu entry.  Hit <Enter> to execute it.  Hit <Esc> if you want to cancel.
This does require the |+menu| feature enabled at compile time.

							*tear-off-menus*
GTK+ 2 and Motif support Tear-off menus.  These are sort of sticky menus or
pop-up menus that are present all the time.  If the resizing does not work
correctly, this may be caused by using something like "Vim*geometry" in the
defaults.  Use "Vim.geometry" instead.

As to GTK+ 3, tear-off menus have been deprecated since GTK+ 3.4.
Accordingly, they are disabled if gvim is linked against GTK+ 3.4 or later.

The Win32 GUI version emulates Motif's tear-off menus.  Actually, a Motif user
will spot the differences easily, but hopefully they're just as useful.  You
can also use the |:tearoff| command together with |hidden-menus| to create
floating menus that do not appear on the main menu bar.


5.2 Creating New Menus					*creating-menus*

				*:me*  *:menu*  *:noreme*  *:noremenu*
				*:am*  *:amenu* *:an*      *:anoremenu*
				*:nme* *:nmenu* *:nnoreme* *:nnoremenu*
				*:ome* *:omenu* *:onoreme* *:onoremenu*
				*:vme* *:vmenu* *:vnoreme* *:vnoremenu*
				*:xme* *:xmenu* *:xnoreme* *:xnoremenu*
				*:sme* *:smenu* *:snoreme* *:snoremenu*
				*:ime* *:imenu* *:inoreme* *:inoremenu*
				*:cme* *:cmenu* *:cnoreme* *:cnoremenu*
				*E330* *E327* *E331* *E336* *E333*
				*E328* *E329* *E337* *E792*
To create a new menu item, use the ":menu" commands.  They are mostly like
the ":map" set of commands but the first argument is a menu item name, given
as a path of menus and submenus with a '.' between them, e.g.: >

   :menu File.Save  :w<CR>
   :inoremenu File.Save  <C-O>:w<CR>
   :menu Edit.Big\ Changes.Delete\ All\ Spaces  :%s/[ ^I]//g<CR>

This last one will create a new item in the menu bar called "Edit", holding
the mouse button down on this will pop up a menu containing the item
"Big Changes", which is a sub-menu containing the item "Delete All Spaces",
which when selected, performs the operation.

Special characters in a menu name:

	&	The next character is the shortcut key.  Make sure each
		shortcut key is only used once in a (sub)menu.  If you want to
		insert a literal "&" in the menu name use "&&".
	<Tab>	Separates the menu name from right-aligned text.  This can be
		used to show the equivalent typed command.  The text "<Tab>"
		can be used here for convenience.  If you are using a real
		tab, don't forget to put a backslash before it!
Example: >

   :amenu &File.&Open<Tab>:e  :browse e<CR>

[typed literally]
With the shortcut "F" (while keeping the <Alt> key pressed), and then "O",
this menu can be used.  The second part is shown as "Open     :e".  The ":e"
is right aligned, and the "O" is underlined, to indicate it is the shortcut.

The ":amenu" command can be used to define menu entries for all modes at once.
To make the command work correctly, a character is automatically inserted for
some modes:
	mode		inserted	appended	~
	Normal		nothing		nothing
	Visual		<C-C>		<C-\><C-G>
	Insert		<C-\><C-O>
	Cmdline		<C-C>		<C-\><C-G>
	Op-pending	<C-C>		<C-\><C-G>

Appending CTRL-\ CTRL-G is for going back to insert mode when 'insertmode' is
set. |CTRL-\_CTRL-G|

Example: >

   :amenu File.Next	:next^M

is equal to: >

   :nmenu File.Next	:next^M
   :vmenu File.Next	^C:next^M^\^G
   :imenu File.Next	^\^O:next^M
   :cmenu File.Next	^C:next^M^\^G
   :omenu File.Next	^C:next^M^\^G

Careful: In Insert mode this only works for a SINGLE Normal mode command,
because of the CTRL-O.  If you have two or more commands, you will need to use
the ":imenu" command.  For inserting text in any mode, you can use the
expression register: >

   :amenu Insert.foobar   "='foobar'<CR>P

Note that the '<' and 'k' flags in 'cpoptions' also apply here (when
included they make the <> form and raw key codes not being recognized).

Note that <Esc> in Cmdline mode executes the command, like in a mapping.  This
is Vi compatible.  Use CTRL-C to quit Cmdline mode.

						*:menu-<silent>* *:menu-silent*
To define a menu which will not be echoed on the command line, add
"<silent>" as the first argument.  Example: >
	:menu <silent> Settings.Ignore\ case  :set ic<CR>
The ":set ic" will not be echoed when using this menu.  Messages from the
executed command are still given though.  To shut them up too, add a ":silent"
in the executed command: >
	:menu <silent> Search.Header :exe ":silent normal /Header\r"<CR>
"<silent>" may also appear just after "<special>" or "<script>".

					*:menu-<special>* *:menu-special*
Define a menu with <> notation for special keys, even though the "<" flag
may appear in 'cpoptions'.  This is useful if the side effect of setting
'cpoptions' is not desired.  Example: >
	:menu <special> Search.Header /Header<CR>
"<special>" must appear as the very first argument to the ":menu" command or
just after "<silent>" or "<script>".

						*:menu-<script>* *:menu-script*
The "to" part of the menu will be inspected for mappings.  If you don't want
this, use the ":noremenu" command (or the similar one for a specific mode).
If you do want to use script-local mappings, add "<script>" as the very first
argument to the ":menu" command or just after "<silent>" or "<special>".

							*menu-priority*
You can give a priority to a menu.  Menus with a higher priority go more to
the right.  The priority is given as a number before the ":menu" command.
Example: >
	:80menu Buffer.next :bn<CR>

The default menus have these priorities:
	File		10
	Edit		20
	Tools		40
	Syntax		50
	Buffers		60
	Window		70
	Help		9999

When no or zero priority is given, 500 is used.
The priority for the PopUp menu is not used.

The Help menu will be placed on the far right side of the menu bar on systems
which support this (Motif and GTK+).  For GTK+ 2 and 3, this is not done
anymore because right-aligning the Help menu is now discouraged UI design.

You can use a priority higher than 9999, to make it go after the Help menu,
but that is non-standard and is discouraged.  The highest possible priority is
about 32000.  The lowest is 1.

							*sub-menu-priority*
The same mechanism can be used to position a sub-menu.  The priority is then
given as a dot-separated list of priorities, before the menu name: >
	:menu 80.500 Buffer.next :bn<CR>
Giving the sub-menu priority is only needed when the item is not to be put
in a normal position.  For example, to put a sub-menu before the other items: >
	:menu 80.100 Buffer.first :brew<CR>
Or to put a sub-menu after the other items, and further items with default
priority will be put before it: >
	:menu 80.900 Buffer.last :blast<CR>
When a number is missing, the default value 500 will be used: >
	:menu .900 myMenu.test :echo "text"<CR>
The menu priority is only used when creating a new menu.  When it already
existed, e.g., in another mode, the priority will not change.  Thus, the
priority only needs to be given the first time a menu is used.
An exception is the PopUp menu.  There is a separate menu for each mode
(Normal, Op-pending, Visual, Insert, Cmdline).  The order in each of these
menus can be different.  This is different from menu-bar menus, which have
the same order for all modes.
NOTE: sub-menu priorities currently don't work for all versions of the GUI.

							*menu-separator* *E332*
Menu items can be separated by a special item that inserts some space between
items.  Depending on the system this is displayed as a line or a dotted line.
These items must start with a '-' and end in a '-'.  The part in between is
used to give it a unique name.  Priorities can be used as with normal items.
Example: >
	:menu Example.item1	:do something
	:menu Example.-Sep-	:
	:menu Example.item2	:do something different
Note that the separator also requires a rhs.  It doesn't matter what it is,
because the item will never be selected.  Use a single colon to keep it
simple.

							*gui-toolbar*
The toolbar is currently available in the Win32, Athena, Motif, GTK+ (X11),
and Photon GUI.  It should turn up in other GUIs in due course.  The
default toolbar is setup in menu.vim.
The display of the toolbar is controlled by the 'guioptions' letter 'T'.  You
can thus have menu & toolbar together, or either on its own, or neither.
The appearance is controlled by the 'toolbar' option.  You can choose between
an image, text or both.

							*toolbar-icon*
The toolbar is defined as a special menu called ToolBar, which only has one
level.  Vim interprets the items in this menu as follows:
1)  If an "icon=" argument was specified, the file with this name is used.
    The file can either be specified with the full path or with the base name.
    In the last case it is searched for in the "bitmaps" directory in
    'runtimepath', like in point 3.  Examples: >
	:amenu icon=/usr/local/pixmaps/foo_icon.xpm ToolBar.Foo :echo "Foo"<CR>
	:amenu icon=FooIcon ToolBar.Foo :echo "Foo"<CR>
<   Note that in the first case the extension is included, while in the second
    case it is omitted.
    If the file cannot be opened the next points are tried.
    A space in the file name must be escaped with a backslash.
    A menu priority must come _after_ the icon argument: >
	:amenu icon=foo 1.42 ToolBar.Foo :echo "42!"<CR>
2)  An item called 'BuiltIn##', where ## is a number, is taken as number ## of
    the built-in bitmaps available in Vim.  Currently there are 31 numbered
    from 0 to 30 which cover most common editing operations |builtin-tools|. >
	:amenu ToolBar.BuiltIn22 :call SearchNext("back")<CR>
3)  An item with another name is first searched for in the directory
    "bitmaps" in 'runtimepath'.  If found, the bitmap file is used as the
    toolbar button image.  Note that the exact filename is OS-specific: For
    example, under Win32 the command >
	:amenu ToolBar.Hello :echo "hello"<CR>
<   would find the file 'hello.bmp'.  Under GTK+/X11 it is 'Hello.xpm'.  With
    GTK+ 2 the files 'Hello.png', 'Hello.xpm' and 'Hello.bmp' are checked for
    existence, and the first one found would be used.
    For MS-Windows and GTK+ 2 the bitmap is scaled to fit the button.  For
    MS-Windows a size of 18 by 18 pixels works best.
    For MS-Windows the bitmap should have 16 colors with the standard palette.
    The light grey pixels will be changed to the Window frame color and the
    dark grey pixels to the window shadow color.  More colors might also work,
    depending on your system.
4)  If the bitmap is still not found, Vim checks for a match against its list
    of built-in names.  Each built-in button image has a name.
    So the command >
	:amenu ToolBar.Open :e
<   will show the built-in "open a file" button image if no open.bmp exists.
    All the built-in names can be seen used in menu.vim.
5)  If all else fails, a blank, but functioning, button is displayed.

27  RunCtags		build tags for files in current directory
28  WinVSplit		split current window vertically
29  WinMaxWidth		make current window use many columns
30  WinMinWidth		make current window use few columns

					*hidden-menus* *win32-hidden-menus*
In the Win32 and GTK+ GUI, starting a menu name with ']' excludes that menu
from the main menu bar.  You must then use the |:popup| or |:tearoff| command
to display it.

							*popup-menu*
In the Win32, GTK+, Motif, Athena and Photon GUI, you can define the
special menu "PopUp".  This is the menu that is displayed when the right mouse
button is pressed, if 'mousemodel' is set to popup or popup_setpos.


5.3 Showing What Menus Are Mapped To			*showing-menus*

To see what an existing menu is mapped to, use just one argument after the
menu commands (just like you would with the ":map" commands).  If the menu
specified is a submenu, then all menus under that hierarchy will be shown.
If no argument is given after :menu at all, then ALL menu items are shown
for the appropriate mode (e.g., Command-line mode for :cmenu).

Special characters in the list, just before the rhs:
*	The menu was defined with "nore" to disallow remapping.
&	The menu was defined with "<script>" to allow remapping script-local
	mappings only.
-	The menu was disabled.

Note that hitting <Tab> while entering a menu name after a menu command may
be used to complete the name of the menu item.


5.4 Executing Menus					*execute-menus*

						*:em*  *:emenu* *E334* *E335*
:[range]em[enu] {menu}		Execute {menu} from the command line.
				The default is to execute the Normal mode
				menu.  If a range is specified, it executes
				the Visual mode menu.
				If used from <c-o>, it executes the
				insert-mode menu Eg: >
	:emenu File.Exit

If the console-mode vim has been compiled with WANT_MENU defined, you can
use :emenu to access useful menu items you may have got used to from GUI
mode.  See 'wildmenu' for an option that works well with this.  See
|console-menus| for an example.

When using a range, if the lines match with '<,'>, then the menu is executed
using the last visual selection.


5.5 Deleting Menus					*delete-menus*

						*:unme*  *:unmenu*
						*:aun*   *:aunmenu*
						*:nunme* *:nunmenu*
						*:ounme* *:ounmenu*
						*:vunme* *:vunmenu*
						*:xunme* *:xunmenu*
						*:sunme* *:sunmenu*
						*:iunme* *:iunmenu*
						*:cunme* *:cunmenu*
To delete a menu item or a whole submenu, use the unmenu commands, which are
analogous to the unmap commands.  Eg: >
    :unmenu! Edit.Paste

This will remove the Paste item from the Edit menu for Insert and
Command-line modes.

Note that hitting <Tab> while entering a menu name after an umenu command
may be used to complete the name of the menu item for the appropriate mode.

To remove all menus use:			*:unmenu-all*  >
	:unmenu *	" remove all menus in Normal and visual mode
	:unmenu! *	" remove all menus in Insert and Command-line mode
	:aunmenu *	" remove all menus in all modes

If you want to get rid of the menu bar: >
	:set guioptions-=m


5.6 Disabling Menus					*disable-menus*

						*:menu-disable* *:menu-enable*
If you do not want to remove a menu, but disable it for a moment, this can be
done by adding the "enable" or "disable" keyword to a ":menu" command.
Examples: >
	:menu disable &File.&Open\.\.\.
	:amenu enable *
	:amenu disable &Tools.*

The command applies to the modes as used with all menu commands.  Note that
characters like "&" need to be included for translated names to be found.
When the argument is "*", all menus are affected.  Otherwise the given menu
name and all existing submenus below it are affected.


5.7 Examples for Menus					*menu-examples*

Here is an example on how to add menu items with menu's!  You can add a menu
item for the keyword under the cursor.  The register "z" is used. >

  :nmenu Words.Add\ Var		wb"zye:menu! Words.<C-R>z <C-R>z<CR>
  :nmenu Words.Remove\ Var	wb"zye:unmenu! Words.<C-R>z<CR>
  :vmenu Words.Add\ Var		"zy:menu! Words.<C-R>z <C-R>z <CR>
  :vmenu Words.Remove\ Var	"zy:unmenu! Words.<C-R>z<CR>
  :imenu Words.Add\ Var		<Esc>wb"zye:menu! Words.<C-R>z <C-R>z<CR>a
  :imenu Words.Remove\ Var	<Esc>wb"zye:unmenu! Words.<C-R>z<CR>a

(the rhs is in <> notation, you can copy/paste this text to try out the
mappings, or put these lines in your gvimrc; "<C-R>" is CTRL-R, "<CR>" is
the <CR> key.  |<>|)


5.8 Tooltips & Menu tips

See section |42.4| in the user manual.

							*:tmenu* *:tm*
:tm[enu] {menupath} {rhs}	Define a tip for a menu or tool.  {only in
				X11 and Win32 GUI}

:tm[enu] [menupath]		List menu tips. {only in X11 and Win32 GUI}

							*:tunmenu* *:tu*
:tu[nmenu] {menupath}		Remove a tip for a menu or tool.
				{only in X11 and Win32 GUI}

When a tip is defined for a menu item, it appears in the command-line area
when the mouse is over that item, much like a standard Windows menu hint in
the status bar.  (Except when Vim is in Command-line mode, when of course
nothing is displayed.)
When a tip is defined for a ToolBar item, it appears as a tooltip when the
mouse pauses over that button, in the usual fashion.  Use the |hl-Tooltip|
highlight group to change its colors.

A "tip" can be defined for each menu item.  For example, when defining a menu
item like this: >
	:amenu MyMenu.Hello :echo "Hello"<CR>
The tip is defined like this: >
	:tmenu MyMenu.Hello Displays a greeting.
And delete it with: >
	:tunmenu MyMenu.Hello

Tooltips are currently only supported for the X11 and Win32 GUI.  However, they
should appear for the other gui platforms in the not too distant future.

The ":tmenu" command works just like other menu commands, it uses the same
arguments.  ":tunmenu" deletes an existing menu tip, in the same way as the
other unmenu commands.

If a menu item becomes invalid (i.e. its actions in all modes are deleted) Vim
deletes the menu tip (and the item) for you.  This means that :aunmenu deletes
a menu item - you don't need to do a :tunmenu as well.


5.9 Popup Menus

In the Win32 and GTK+ GUI, you can cause a menu to popup at the cursor.
This behaves similarly to the PopUp menus except that any menu tree can
be popped up.

This command is for backwards compatibility, using it is discouraged, because
it behaves in a strange way.

							*:popup* *:popu*
:popu[p] {name}			Popup the menu {name}.  The menu named must
				have at least one subentry, but need not
				appear on the menu-bar (see |hidden-menus|).
				{only available for Win32 and GTK GUI}

:popu[p]! {name}		Like above, but use the position of the mouse
				pointer instead of the cursor.

Example: >
	:popup File
will make the "File" menu (if there is one) appear at the text cursor (mouse
pointer if ! was used). >

	:amenu ]Toolbar.Make	:make<CR>
	:popup ]Toolbar
This creates a popup menu that doesn't exist on the main menu-bar.

Note that a menu that starts with ']' will not be displayed.

==============================================================================
6. Extras						*gui-extras*

This section describes other features which are related to the GUI.

- With the GUI, there is no wait for one second after hitting escape, because
  the key codes don't start with <Esc>.

- Typing ^V followed by a special key in the GUI will insert "<Key>", since
  the internal string used is meaningless.  Modifiers may also be held down to
  get "<Modifiers-Key>".

- In the GUI, the modifiers SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT (or META) may be used within
  mappings of special keys and mouse events.  E.g.: :map <M-LeftDrag> <LeftDrag>

- In the GUI, several normal keys may have modifiers in mappings etc, these
  are <Space>, <Tab>, <NL>, <CR>, <Esc>.

- To check in a Vim script if the GUI is being used, you can use something
  like this: >

	if has("gui_running")
	   echo "yes, we have a GUI"
	else
	   echo "Boring old console"
	endif
<							*setting-guifont*
- When you use the same vimrc file on various systems, you can use something
  like this to set options specifically for each type of GUI: >

	if has("gui_running")
	    if has("gui_gtk2")
		:set guifont=Luxi\ Mono\ 12
	    elseif has("x11")
		" Also for GTK 1
		:set guifont=*-lucidatypewriter-medium-r-normal-*-*-180-*-*-m-*-*
	    elseif has("gui_win32")
		:set guifont=Luxi_Mono:h12:cANSI
	    endif
	endif

A recommended Japanese font is MS Mincho.  You can find info here:
http://www.lexikan.com/mincho.htm

==============================================================================
7. Shell Commands					*gui-shell*

For the X11 GUI the external commands are executed inside the gvim window.
See |gui-pty|.

WARNING: Executing an external command from the X11 GUI will not always
work.  "normal" commands like "ls", "grep" and "make" mostly work fine.
Commands that require an intelligent terminal like "less" and "ispell" won't
work.  Some may even hang and need to be killed from another terminal.  So be
careful!

For the Win32 GUI the external commands are executed in a separate window.

{Vi does not have a Windows GUI}

==============================================================================
1. Starting the GUI					*gui-w32-start*

The Win32 GUI version of Vim will always start the GUI, no matter how you
start it or what it's called.

The GUI will always run in the Windows subsystem.  Mostly shells automatically
return with a command prompt after starting gvim.  If not, you should use the
"start" command: >
	start gvim [options] file ..

Note: All fonts (bold, italic) must be of the same size!!!  If you don't do
this, text will disappear or mess up the display.  Vim does not check the font
sizes.  It's the size in screen pixels that must be the same.  Note that some
fonts that have the same point size don't have the same pixel size!
Additionally, the positioning of the fonts must be the same (ascent and
descent).

The Win32 GUI has an extra menu item:  "Edit/Select Font".  It brings up the
standard Windows font selector.

Setting the menu height doesn't work for the Win32 GUI.

							*gui-win32-maximized*
If you want Vim to start with a maximized window, add this command to your
vimrc or gvimrc file: >
	au GUIEnter * simalt ~x
<

Using Vim as a plugin					*gui-w32-windowid*

When gvim starts up normally, it creates its own top level window.  If you
pass Vim the command-line option |--windowid| with a decimal or hexadecimal
value, Vim will create a window that is a child of the window with the given
ID.  This enables Vim to act as a plugin in another application.  This really
is a programmer's interface, and is of no use without a supporting application
to spawn Vim correctly.

==============================================================================
2. Vim as default editor				*vim-default-editor*

To set Vim as the default editor for a file type:
1. Start a Windows Explorer
2. Choose View/Options -> File Types
3. Select the path to gvim for every file type that you want to use it for.
   (you can also use three spaces in the file type field, for files without an
   extension).
   In the "open" action, use: >
	gvim "%1"
<  The quotes are required for using file names with embedded spaces.
   You can also use this: >
	gvim "%L"
<  This should avoid short (8.3 character) file names in some situations.  But
   I'm not sure if this works everywhere.

When you open a file in Vim by double clicking it, Vim changes to that
file's directory.

If you want Vim to start full-screen, use this for the Open action: >
	gvim -c "simalt ~x" "%1"

Another method, which also works when you put Vim in another directory (e.g.,
when you have got a new version):
1. select a file you want to use Vim with
2. <Shift-F10>
3. select "Open With..." menu entry
4. click "Other..."
5. browse to the (new) location of Vim and click "Open"
6. make "Always Use this program..." checked
7. <OK>

						*send-to-menu* *sendto*
You can also install Vim in the "Send To" menu:
1. Start a Windows Explorer
2. Navigate to your sendto directory:
   Windows NT: %windir%\profiles\%user%\sendto (e.g.
	       "c:\winnt\profiles\mattha\sendto")
   Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\%user%\SendTo
   Windows Vista: C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo .
3. Right-click in the file pane and select New->Shortcut
4. Follow the shortcut wizard, using the full path to VIM/GVIM.

When you 'send a file to Vim', Vim changes to that file's directory.  Note,
however, that any long directory names will appear in their short (MS-DOS)
form.  This is a limitation of the Windows "Send To" mechanism.

						*notepad*
You could replace notepad.exe with gvim.exe, but that has a few side effects.
Some programs rely on notepad arguments, which are not recognized by Vim.  For
example "notepad -p" is used by some applications to print a file.  It's
better to leave notepad where it is and use another way to start Vim.

						*win32-popup-menu*
A more drastic approach is to install an "Edit with Vim" entry in the popup
menu for the right mouse button.  With this you can edit any file with Vim.

This can co-exist with the file associations mentioned above.  The difference
is that the file associations will make starting Vim the default action.  With
the "Edit with Vim" menu entry you can keep the existing file association for
double clicking on the file, and edit the file with Vim when you want.  For
example, you can associate "*.mak" with your make program.  You can execute
the makefile by double clicking it and use the "Edit with Vim" entry to edit
the makefile.

You can select any files and right-click to see a menu option called "Edit
with gvim".  Choosing this menu option will invoke gvim with the file you have
selected.  If you select multiple files, you will find two gvim-related menu
options:
"Edit with multiple gvims"  -- one gvim for each file in the selection
"Edit with single gvim"     -- one gvim for all the files in the selection
And if there already is a gvim running:
"Edit with existing gvim"   -- edit the file with the running gvim

The "edit with existing Vim" entries can be disabled by adding an entry in the
registry under HKLM\Software\Vim\Gvim, named DisableEditWithExisting, and with
any value.
						*install-registry*
You can add the "Edit with Vim" menu entry in an easy way by using the
"install.exe" program.  It will add several registry entries for you.

You can also do this by hand.  This is complicated!  Use the install.exe if
you can.

1. Start the registry editor with "regedit".
2. Add these keys:
   key		value name		    value ~
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{51EEE242-AD87-11d3-9C1E-0090278BBD99}
		{default}		    Vim Shell Extension
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{51EEE242-AD87-11d3-9C1E-0090278BBD99}\InProcServer32
		{default}		    {path}\gvimext.dll
		ThreadingModel		    Apartment
   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\gvim
		{default}		    {51EEE242-AD87-11d3-9C1E-0090278BBD99}
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Shell Extensions\Approved
		{51EEE242-AD87-11d3-9C1E-0090278BBD99}
					    Vim Shell Extension
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Vim\Gvim
		path			    {path}\gvim.exe
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\vim 5.6
		DisplayName		    Vim 5.6: Edit with Vim popup menu entry
		UninstallString		    {path}\uninstal.exe

   Replace {path} with the path that leads to the executable.
   Don't type {default}, this is the value for the key itself.

To remove "Edit with Vim" from the popup menu, just remove the registry
entries mentioned above.  The "uninstal.exe" program can do this for you.  You
can also use the entry in the Windows standard "Add/Remove Programs" list.

If you notice that this entry overrules other file type associations, set
those associations again by hand (using Windows Explorer, see above).  This
only seems to happen on some Windows NT versions (Windows bug?).  Procedure:
1. Find the name of the file type.  This can be done by starting the registry
   editor, and searching for the extension in \\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
2. In a Windows Explorer, use View/Options/File Types.  Search for the file
   type in the list and click "Edit".  In the actions list, you can select on
   to be used as the default (normally the "open" action) and click on the
   "Set Default" button.


Vim in the "Open With..." context menu			*win32-open-with-menu*

If you use the Vim install program you have the choice to add Vim to the "Open
With..." menu.  This means you can use Vim to edit many files.  Not every file
(for unclear reasons...), thus the "Edit with Vim" menu entry is still useful.

One reason to add this is to be able to edit HTML files directly from Internet
Explorer.  To enable this use the "Tools" menu, "Internet Options..." entry.
In the dialog select the "Programs" tab and select Vim in the "HTML editor"
choice.  If it's not there than installing didn't work properly.

Doing this manually can be done with this script:

----------------------------------------------------------
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe\shell]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe\shell\edit]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe\shell\edit\command]
@="c:\\vim\\vim62\\gvim.exe \"%1\""

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.htm\OpenWithList\gvim.exe]

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\OpenWithList\gvim.exe]

----------------------------------------------------------

Change the "c:\\vim\\vim62" bit to where gvim.exe is actually located.

To uninstall this run the Vim uninstall program or manually delete the
registry entries with "regedit".

==============================================================================
3. Using the clipboard					*gui-clipboard*

Windows has a clipboard, where you can copy text to, and paste text from.  Vim
supports this in several ways.  For other systems see |gui-selections|.

The "* register reflects the contents of the clipboard.  |quotestar|

When the "unnamed" string is included in the 'clipboard' option, the unnamed
register is the same.  Thus you can yank to and paste from the clipboard
without prepending "* to commands.

The 'a' flag in 'guioptions' is not included by default.  This means that text
is only put on the clipboard when an operation is performed on it.  Just
Visually selecting text doesn't put it on the clipboard.  When the 'a' flag is
included, the text is copied to the clipboard even when it is not operated
upon.

							*mswin.vim*
To use the standard MS-Windows way of CTRL-X, CTRL-C and CTRL-V, use the
$VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim script.  You could add this line to your _vimrc file: >
	source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim

Since CTRL-C is used to copy the text to the clipboard, it can't be used to
cancel an operation.  Use CTRL-Break for that.

CTRL-Z is used for undo.  This means you can't suspend Vim with this key, use
|:suspend| instead (if it's supported at all).

						*CTRL-V-alternative* *CTRL-Q*
Since CTRL-V is used to paste, you can't use it to start a blockwise Visual
selection.  You can use CTRL-Q instead.  You can also use CTRL-Q in Insert
mode and Command-line mode to get the old meaning of CTRL-V.  But CTRL-Q
doesn't work for terminals when it's used for control flow.

NOTE: The clipboard support still has a number of bugs.  See |todo|.

==============================================================================
4. Shell Commands					*gui-shell-win32*

Vim uses another window for external commands, to make it possible to run any
command.  The external command gets its own environment for running, just like
it was started from a DOS prompt.

							*win32-vimrun*
Executing an external command is done indirectly by the "vimrun" command.  The
"vimrun.exe" must be in the path for this to work.  Or it must be in the same
directory as the Vim executable.  If "vimrun" cannot be found, the command is
executed directly, but then the DOS window closes immediately after the
external command has finished.
WARNING: If you close this window with the "X" button, and confirm the
question if you really want to kill the application, Vim may be killed too!
(This does not apply to commands run asynchronously with ":!start".)

The window in which the commands are executed will be the default you have set
up for "Console" in Control Panel.

							*win32-!start*
Normally, Vim waits for a command to complete before continuing (this makes
sense for most shell commands which produce output for Vim to use).  If you
want Vim to start a program and return immediately, you can use the following
syntax: >
	:!start [/min] {command}
The optional "/min" causes the window to be minimized.

==============================================================================
5. Special colors					*win32-colors*

On Win32, the normal DOS colors can be used.  See |dos-colors|.

Additionally the system configured colors can also be used.  These are known
by the names Sys_XXX, where XXX is the appropriate system color name, from the
following list (see the Win32 documentation for full descriptions).  Case is
ignored.

Sys_3DDKShadow		Sys_3DFace			Sys_BTNFace
Sys_3DHilight		Sys_3DHighlight			Sys_BTNHilight
Sys_BTNHighlight	Sys_3DLight			Sys_3DShadow
Sys_BTNShadow		Sys_ActiveBorder		Sys_ActiveCaption
Sys_AppWorkspace	Sys_Background			Sys_Desktop
Sys_BTNText		Sys_CaptionText			Sys_GrayText
Sys_Highlight		Sys_HighlightText		Sys_InactiveBorder
Sys_InactiveCaption	Sys_InactiveCaptionText		Sys_InfoBK
Sys_InfoText		Sys_Menu			Sys_MenuText
Sys_ScrollBar		Sys_Window			Sys_WindowFrame
Sys_WindowText

Probably the most useful values are
	Sys_Window	    Normal window background
	Sys_WindowText      Normal window text
	Sys_Highlight       Highlighted background
	Sys_HighlightText   Highlighted text

These extra colors are also available:
Gray, Grey, LightYellow, SeaGreen, Orange, Purple, SlateBlue, Violet,

								*rgb.txt*
Additionally, colors defined by a "rgb.txt" file can be used.  This file is
well known from X11.  A few lines from it: >

  255 218 185		   peach puff
  205 133  63		   peru
  255 181 197		   pink

This shows the layout of the file:  First the R, G and B value as a decimal
number, followed by the name of the color.  The four fields are separated by
spaces.

You can get an rgb.txt file from any X11 distribution.  It is located in a
directory like "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/".  For Vim it must be located in the
$VIMRUNTIME directory.  Thus the file can be found with "$VIMRUNTIME/rgb.txt".

==============================================================================
						*gui-w32-dialogs* *dialog*
6. Windows dialogs & browsers

The Win32 GUI can use familiar Windows components for some operations, as well
as the traditional interface shared with the console version.


6.1 Dialogs

The dialogs displayed by the "confirm" family (i.e. the 'confirm' option,
|:confirm| command and |confirm()| function) are GUI-based rather than the
console-based ones used by other versions.  The 'c' flag in 'guioptions'
changes this.


6.2 File Browsers

When prepending ":browse" before file editing commands, a file requester is
used to allow you to select an existing file.  See |:browse|.


6.3 Tearoff Menus

The Win32 GUI emulates Motif's tear-off menus.  At the top of each menu you
will see a small graphic "rip here" sign.  Selecting it will cause a floating
window to be created with the same menu entries on it.  The floating menu can
then be accessed just as if it was the original (including sub-menus), but
without having to go to the menu bar each time.
This is most useful if you find yourself using a command buried in a sub-menu
over and over again.
The tearoff menus can be positioned where you like, and always stay just above
the Main Vim window.  You can get rid of them by closing them as usual; they
also of course close when you exit Vim.

							*:tearoff* *:te*
:te[aroff] {name}	Tear-off the menu {name}.  The menu named must have at
			least one subentry, but need not appear on the
			menu-bar (see |win32-hidden-menus|).

Example: >
	:tearoff File
will make the "File" menu (if there is one) appear as a tearoff menu. >

	:amenu ]Toolbar.Make	:make<CR>
	:tearoff ]Toolbar
This creates a floating menu that doesn't exist on the main menu-bar.

Note that a menu that starts with ']' will not be displayed.

==============================================================================
7. Command line arguments				*gui-w32-cmdargs*

Analysis of a command line into parameters is not standardised in MS Windows.
Gvim has to provide logic to analyse a command line.  This logic is likely to
be different from the default logic provided by a compilation system used to
build vim.  The differences relate to unusual double quote (") usage.
The arguments "C:\My Music\freude.txt" and "+/Sch\"iller" are handled in the
same way.  The argument "+/Sch""iller" may be handled different by gvim and
vim, depending what it was compiled with.

The rules are:
      a) A parameter is a sequence of graphic characters.
      b) Parameters are separated by white space.
      c) A parameter can be enclosed in double quotes to include white space.
      d) A sequence of zero or more backslashes (\) and a double quote (")
	is special.  The effective number of backslashes is halved, rounded
	down.  An even number of backslashes reverses the acceptability of
	spaces and tabs, an odd number of backslashes produces a literal
	double quote.

So:
	"	is a special double quote
	\"	is a literal double quote
	\\"	is a literal backslash and a special double quote
	\\\"	is a literal backslash and a literal double quote
	\\\\"	is 2 literal backslashes and a special double quote
	\\\\\"	is 2 literal backslashes and a literal double quote
	etc.

Example: >
	gvim "C:\My Music\freude" +"set ignorecase" +/"\"foo\\" +\"bar\\\"

opens "C:\My Music\freude" and executes the line mode commands: >
	set ignorecase; /"foo\ and /bar\"

==============================================================================
8. Various						*gui-w32-various*

							*gui-w32-printing*
The "File/Print" menu prints the text with syntax highlighting, see
|:hardcopy|.  If you just want to print the raw text and have a default
printer installed this should also work: >
	:w >>prn

Vim supports a number of standard MS Windows features.  Some of these are
detailed elsewhere: see |'mouse'|, |win32-hidden-menus|.

							*drag-n-drop-win32*
You can drag and drop one or more files into the Vim window, where they will
be opened as normal.  See |drag-n-drop|.

							*:simalt* *:sim*
:sim[alt] {key}		simulate pressing {key} while holding Alt pressed.
			{not in Vi} {only for Win32 versions}
			Note: ":si" means ":s" with the "i" flag.

Normally, Vim takes control of all Alt-<Key> combinations, to increase the
number of possible mappings.  This clashes with the standard use of Alt as the
key for accessing menus.
The quick way of getting standard behavior is to set the 'winaltkeys' option
to "yes".  This however prevents you from mapping Alt keys at all.
Another way is to set 'winaltkeys' to "menu".  Menu shortcut keys are then
handled by windows, other ALT keys can be mapped.  This doesn't allow a
dependency on the current state though.
To get round this, the :simalt command allows Vim (when 'winaltkeys' is not
"yes") to fake a Windows-style Alt keypress.  You can use this to map Alt key
combinations (or anything else for that matter) to produce standard Windows
actions.  Here are some examples: >

	:map <M-f> :simalt f<CR>
This makes Alt-F pop down the 'File' menu (with the stock Menu.vim) by
simulating the keystrokes Alt, F. >
	:map <M-Space> :simalt ~<CR>
This maps Alt-Space to pop down the system menu for the Vim window.  Note that
~ is used by simalt to represent the <Space> character. >
	:map <C-n> :simalt ~n<CR>
Maps Control-N to produce the keys Alt-Space followed by N.  This minimizes the
Vim window via the system menu.

Note that the key changes depending on the language you are using.

						*intellimouse-wheel-problems*
When using the Intellimouse mouse wheel causes Vim to stop accepting input, go
to:
	ControlPanel - Mouse - Wheel - UniversalScrolling - Exceptions

And add gvim to the list of applications.  This problem only appears to happen
with the Intellimouse driver 2.2 and when "Universal Scrolling" is turned on.


XPM support						*w32-xpm-support*

Gvim can be build on MS-Windows with support for XPM files.  |+xpm_w32|
See the Make_mvc.mak file for instructions, search for XPM.

To try out if XPM support works do this: >
	:help
	:exe 'sign define vimxpm icon=' . $VIMRUNTIME . '\\vim16x16.xpm'
	:exe 'sign place 1 line=1 name=vimxpm file=' . expand('%:p')

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Vim's Graphical User Interface				*gui-x11* *GUI-X11*
							*Athena* *Motif*
1. Starting the X11 GUI		|gui-x11-start|
2. GUI Resources		|gui-resources|
3. Shell Commands		|gui-pty|
4. Various			|gui-x11-various|
5. GTK version			|gui-gtk|
6. GNOME version		|gui-gnome|
7. KDE version			|gui-kde|
8. Compiling			|gui-x11-compiling|
9. X11 selection mechanism	|x11-selection|

Other relevant documentation:
|gui.txt|	For generic items of the GUI.

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Starting the X11 GUI					*gui-x11-start* *E665*

Then you can run the GUI version of Vim in either of these ways:
    gvim [options] [files...]
    vim -g [options] [files...]

So if you call the executable "gvim", or make "gvim" a link to the executable,
then the GUI version will automatically be used.  Additional characters may be
added after "gvim", for example "gvim-5".

You may also start up the GUI from within the terminal version by using one of
these commands:
	:gui [++opt] [+cmd] [-f|-b] [files...]			*:gu* *:gui*
	:gvim [++opt] [+cmd] [-f|-b] [files...]			*:gv* *:gvim*
The "-f" option runs Vim in the foreground.
The "-b" option runs Vim in the background (this is the default).
Also see |++opt| and |+cmd|.

							*gui-fork*
When the GUI is started, it does a fork() and exits the current process.
When gvim was started from a shell this makes the shell accept further
commands.  If you don't want this (e.g. when using gvim for a mail program
that waits for gvim to exit), start gvim with "gvim -f", "vim -gf" or use
":gui -f".  Don't use "vim -fg", because "-fg" specifies the foreground
color.

When using "gvim -f" and then ":gui", Vim will run in the foreground.  The
"-f" argument will be remembered.  To force running Vim in the background use
":gui -b".

"gvim --nofork" does the same as "gvim -f".
								*E851* *E852*
When starting the GUI fails Vim will try to continue running in the terminal.

If you want the GUI to run in the foreground always, include the 'f'
flag in 'guioptions'.  |-f|.

==============================================================================
2. GUI Resources			*gui-resources* *.Xdefaults*

If using the Motif or Athena version of the GUI (not for the KDE, GTK+ or Win32
version), a number of X resources are available.  You should use Vim's class
"Vim" when setting these.  They are as follows:

    Resource name	Meaning		~

    reverseVideo	Boolean: should reverse video be used?
    background		Color of background.
    foreground		Color of normal text.
    scrollBackground	Color of trough portion of scrollbars.
    scrollForeground	Color of slider and arrow portions of scrollbars.
    menuBackground	Color of menu backgrounds.
    menuForeground	Color of menu foregrounds.
    tooltipForeground	Color of tooltip and balloon foreground.
    tooltipBackground	Color of tooltip and balloon background.

    font		Name of font used for normal text.
    boldFont		Name of font used for bold text.
    italicFont		Name of font used for italic text.
    boldItalicFont	Name of font used for bold, italic text.
    menuFont		Name of font used for the menus, used when compiled
			without the |+xfontset| feature
    menuFontSet		Name of fontset used for the menus, used when compiled
			with the |+xfontset| feature
    tooltipFont		Name of the font used for the tooltip and balloons.
			When compiled with the |+xfontset| feature this is a
			fontset name.

    geometry		Initial geometry to use for gvim's window (default
			is same size as terminal that started it).
    scrollbarWidth	Thickness of scrollbars.
    borderWidth		Thickness of border around text area.
    menuHeight		Height of the menu bar (only for Athena).

A special font for italic, bold, and italic-bold text will only be used if
the user has specified one via a resource.  No attempt is made to guess what
fonts should be used for these based on the normal text font.

Note that the colors can also be set with the ":highlight" command, using the
"Normal", "Menu", "Tooltip", and "Scrollbar" groups.  Example: >
	:highlight Menu guibg=lightblue
	:highlight Tooltip guibg=yellow
	:highlight Scrollbar guibg=lightblue guifg=blue
	:highlight Normal guibg=grey90
<
							*font-sizes*
Note: All fonts (except for the menu and tooltip) must be of the same size!!!
If you don't do this, text will disappear or mess up the display.  Vim does
not check the font sizes.  It's the size in screen pixels that must be the
same.  Note that some fonts that have the same point size don't have the same
pixel size!  Additionally, the positioning of the fonts must be the same
(ascent and descent).  You can check this with "xlsfonts -l {fontname}".

If any of these things are also set with Vim commands, e.g. with
":set guifont=Screen15", then this will override the X resources (currently
'guifont' is the only option that is supported).

Here is an example of what you might put in your ~/.Xdefaults file: >

	Vim*useSchemes:			all
	Vim*sgiMode:			true
	Vim*useEnhancedFSB:		true
	Vim.foreground:			Black
	Vim.background:			Wheat
	Vim*fontList:			7x13

The first three of these are standard resources on Silicon Graphics machines
which make Motif applications look even better, highly recommended!

The "Vim*fontList" is to set the menu font for Motif.  Example: >
	Vim*menuBar*fontList:	     -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
With Athena: >
	Vim*menuBar*SmeBSB*font:     -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
	Vim*menuBar*MenuButton*font: -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

NOTE: A more portable, and indeed more correct, way to specify the menu font
in either Motif or Athena is through the resource: >
	Vim.menuFont:	     -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
Or, when compiled with the |+xfontset| feature: >
	Vim.menuFontSet:     -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

Don't use "Vim*geometry" in the defaults.  This will break the menus.  Use
"Vim.geometry" instead.

If you get an error message "Cannot allocate colormap entry for "gray60",
try adding this to your Vim resources (change the colors to your liking): >

	Vim*scrollBackground:		Black
	Vim*scrollForeground:		Blue

The resources can also be set with arguments to Vim:

    argument		meaning	~
							*-gui*
   -display {display}	Run vim on {display}		*-display*
   -iconic		Start vim iconified		*-iconic*
   -background {color}	Use {color} for the background	*-background*
   -bg {color}		idem				*-bg*
   -foreground {color}	Use {color} for normal text	*-foreground*
   -fg {color}		idem				*-fg*
   -ul {color}		idem				*-ul*
   -font {font}		Use {font} for normal text	*-font*
   -fn {font}		idem				*-fn*
   -boldfont {font}	Use {font} for bold text	*-boldfont*
   -italicfont {font}	Use {font} for italic text	*-italicfont*
   -menufont {font}	Use {font} for menu items	*-menufont*
   -menufontset {fontset} Use {fontset} for menu items	*-menufontset*
   -mf {font}		idem				*-mf*
   -geometry {geom}	Use {geom} for initial geometry	*-geometry*
   -geom {geom}		idem, see |-geometry-example|	*-geom*
   -borderwidth {width}	Use a border width of {width}	*-borderwidth*
   -bw {width}		idem				*-bw*
							*-scrollbarwidth*
   -scrollbarwidth {width}	Use a scrollbar width of {width}
   -sw {width}		idem				*-sw*
   -menuheight {height}	Use a menu bar height of {height} *-menuheight*
   -mh {height}		idem				*-mh*
			NOTE: On Motif the value is ignored, the menu height
			is computed to fit the menus.
   -reverse		Use reverse video		*-reverse*
   -rv			idem				*-rv*
   +reverse		Don't use reverse video		*-+reverse*
   +rv			idem				*-+rv*
   -xrm {resource}	Set the specified resource	*-xrm*

Note about reverse video: Vim checks that the result is actually a light text
on a dark background.  The reason is that some X11 versions swap the colors,
and some don't.  These two examples will both give yellow text on a blue
background:
    gvim -fg Yellow -bg Blue -reverse
    gvim -bg Yellow -fg Blue -reverse

							*-geometry-example*
An example for the geometry argument: >
	gvim -geometry 80x63+8+100
This creates a window with 80 columns and 63 lines at position 8 pixels from
the left and 100 pixels from the top of the screen.

==============================================================================
3. Shell Commands					*gui-pty*

WARNING: Executing an external command from the GUI will not always work.
"normal" commands like "ls", "grep" and "make" mostly work fine.  Commands
that require an intelligent terminal like "less" and "ispell" won't work.
Some may even hang and need to be killed from another terminal.  So be
careful!

There are two ways to do the I/O with a shell command: Pipes and a pseudo-tty.
The default is to use a pseudo-tty.  This should work best on most systems.

Unfortunately, the implementation of the pseudo-tty is different on every Unix
system.  And some systems require root permission.  To avoid running into
problems with a pseudo-tty when you least expect it, test it when not editing
a file.  Be prepared to "kill" the started command or Vim.  Commands like
":r !cat" may hang!

If using a pseudo-tty does not work for you, reset the 'guipty' option: >

	:set noguipty

Using a pipe should work on any Unix system, but there are disadvantages:
- Some shell commands will notice that a pipe is being used and behave
  differently.  E.g., ":!ls" will list the files in one column.
- The ":sh" command won't show a prompt, although it will sort of work.
- When using ":make" it's not possible to interrupt with a CTRL-C.

Typeahead while the external command is running is often lost.  This happens
both with a pipe and a pseudo-tty.  This is a known problem, but it seems it
can't be fixed (or at least, it's very difficult).

							*gui-pty-erase*
When your erase character is wrong for an external command, you should fix
this in your "~/.cshrc" file, or whatever file your shell uses for
initializations.  For example, when you want to use backspace to delete
characters, but hitting backspaces produces "^H" instead, try adding this to
your "~/.cshrc": >
	stty erase ^H
The ^H is a real CTRL-H, type it as CTRL-V CTRL-H.

==============================================================================
4. Various						*gui-x11-various*

							*gui-x11-printing*
The "File/Print" menu simply sends the current buffer to "lpr".  No options or
whatever.  If you want something else, you can define your own print command.
For example: >

  :10amenu File.Print :w !lpr -Php3
  :10vmenu File.Print :w !lpr -Php3
<
							*X11-icon*
Vim uses a black&white icon by default when compiled with Motif or Athena.  A
colored Vim icon is included as $VIMRUNTIME/vim32x32.xpm.  For GTK+, this is
the builtin icon used.  Unfortunately, how you should install it depends on
your window manager.  When you use this, remove the 'i' flag from
'guioptions', to remove the black&white icon: >
  :set guioptions-=i

If you use one of the fvwm* family of window managers simply add this line to
your .fvwm2rc configuration file: >

  Style "vim"		Icon vim32x32.xpm

Make sure the icon file's location is consistent with the window manager's
ImagePath statement.  Either modify the ImagePath from within your .fvwm2rc or
drop the icon into one the pre-defined directories: >

  ImagePath /usr/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps:/usr/X11R6/include/X11/bitmaps

Note: older versions of fvwm use "IconPath" instead of "ImagePath".

For CDE "dtwm" (a derivative of Motif) add this line in the .Xdefaults: >
   Dtwm*Vim*iconImage: /usr/local/share/vim/vim32x32.xpm

For "mwm" (Motif window manager) the line would be: >
   Mwm*Vim*iconImage: /usr/local/share/vim/vim32x32.xpm

Mouse Pointers Available in X11				*X11_mouse_shapes*

By using the |'mouseshape'| option, the mouse pointer can be automatically
changed whenever Vim enters one of its various modes (e.g., Insert or
Command).  Currently, the available pointers are:

	arrow			an arrow pointing northwest
	beam			a I-like vertical bar
	size			an arrow pointing up and down
	busy			a wristwatch
	blank			an invisible pointer
	crosshair		a thin "+" sign
	hand1			a dark hand pointing northeast
	hand2			a light hand pointing northwest
	pencil			a pencil pointing southeast
	question		question_arrow
	right_arrow		an arrow pointing northeast
	up_arrow		an arrow pointing upwards

Additionally, any of the mouse pointers that are built into X11 may be
used by specifying an integer from the X11/cursorfont.h include file.

If a name is used that exists on other systems, but not in X11, the default
"arrow" pointer is used.

==============================================================================
5. GTK version					*gui-gtk* *GTK+* *GTK* *GTK3*

The GTK version of the GUI works a little bit different.

GTK does _not_ use the traditional X resource settings.  Thus items in your
~/.Xdefaults or app-defaults files are not used.
Many of the traditional X command line arguments are not supported.  (e.g.,
stuff like -bg, -fg, etc).  The ones that are supported are:

    command line argument   resource name	meaning ~
    -fn  or  -font	    .font		font name for the text
    -geom  or  -geometry    .geometry		size of the gvim window
    -rv  or  -reverse	    *reverseVideo	white text on black background
    -display					display to be used
    -fg -foreground {color}			foreground color
    -bg -background {color}			background color

To set the font, see |'guifont'|.  For GTK, there's also a menu option that
does this.

Additionally, there are these command line arguments, which are handled by GTK
internally.  Look in the GTK documentation for how they are used:
	--sync
	--gdk-debug
	--gdk-no-debug
	--no-xshm	(not in GTK+ 2)
	--xim-preedit	(not in GTK+ 2)
	--xim-status	(not in GTK+ 2)
	--gtk-debug
	--gtk-no-debug
	--g-fatal-warnings
	--gtk-module
	--display	(GTK+ counterpart of -display; works the same way.)
	--screen	(The screen number; for GTK+ 2.2 multihead support.)

These arguments are ignored when the |+netbeans_intg| feature is used:
	-xrm
	-mf

As for colors, Vim's color settings (for syntax highlighting) is still
done the traditional Vim way.  See |:highlight| for more help.

If you want to set the colors of remaining gui components (e.g., the
menubar, scrollbar, whatever), those are GTK specific settings and you
need to set those up in some sort of gtkrc file.  You'll have to refer
to the GTK documentation, however little there is, on how to do this.
See http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/gtk-Resource-Files.html
for more information.

						*gtk-tooltip-colors*
Example, which sets the tooltip colors to black on light-yellow: >

	style "tooltips"
	{
		bg[NORMAL] = "#ffffcc"
		fg[NORMAL] = "#000000"
	}

	widget "gtk-tooltips*"		style "tooltips"

Write this in the file ~/.gtkrc and it will be used by GTK+.  For GTK+ 2
you might have to use the file ~/.gtkrc-2.0 instead, depending on your
distribution.

For GTK+ 3, an effect similar to the above can be obtained by adding the
following snippet of CSS code to $XDG_HOME_DIR/gtk-3.0/gtk.css (usually,
$HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css):
 >
	.tooltip {
		background-color: #ffffcc;
		color: #000000;
	}
<

Using Vim as a GTK+ plugin				*gui-gtk-socketid*

When the GTK+ version of Vim starts up normally, it creates its own top level
window (technically, a 'GtkWindow').  GTK+ provides an embedding facility with
its GtkSocket and GtkPlug widgets.  If one GTK+ application creates a
GtkSocket widget in one of its windows, an entirely different GTK+ application
may embed itself into the first application by creating a top-level GtkPlug
widget using the socket's ID.

If you pass Vim the command-line option '--socketid' with a decimal or
hexadecimal value, Vim will create a GtkPlug widget using that value instead
of the normal GtkWindow.  This enables Vim to act as a GTK+ plugin.

This really is a programmer's interface, and is of no use without a supporting
application to spawn the Vim correctly.  For more details on GTK+ sockets, see
http://www.gtk.org/api/

Note that this feature requires the latest GTK version.  GTK 1.2.10 still has
a small problem.  The socket feature has not yet been tested with GTK+ 2 --
feel free to volunteer.

==============================================================================
6. GNOME version				*gui-gnome* *Gnome* *GNOME*

The GNOME GUI works just like the GTK+ version.  See |GTK+| above for how it
works.  It looks a bit different though, and implements one important feature
that's not available in the plain GTK+ GUI:  Interaction with the session
manager. |gui-gnome-session|

These are the different looks:
- Uses GNOME dialogs (GNOME 1 only).  The GNOME 2 GUI uses the same nice
  dialogs as the GTK+ 2 version.
- Uses the GNOME dock, so that the toolbar and menubar can be moved to
  different locations other than the top (e.g., the toolbar can be placed on
  the left, right, top, or bottom).  The placement of the menubar and
  toolbar is only saved in the GNOME 2 version.
- That means the menubar and toolbar handles are back!  Yeah!  And the
  resizing grid still works too.

GNOME is compiled with if it was found by configure and the
--enable-gnome-check argument was used.

Note: Avoid use of --enable-gnome-check with GTK+ 3 GUI build.  The
functionality mentioned above is consolidated in GTK+ 3.


GNOME session support			*gui-gnome-session* *gnome-session*

On logout, Vim shows the well-known exit confirmation dialog if any buffers
are modified.  Clicking [Cancel] will stop the logout process.  Otherwise the
current session is stored to disk by using the |:mksession| command, and
restored the next time you log in.

The GNOME session support should also work with the KDE session manager.
If you are experiencing any problems please report them as bugs.

Note: The automatic session save works entirely transparent, in order to
avoid conflicts with your own session files, scripts and autocommands.  That
means in detail:
- The session file is stored to a separate directory (usually $HOME/.gnome2).
- 'sessionoptions' is ignored, and a hardcoded set of appropriate flags is
  used instead: >
	blank,curdir,folds,globals,help,options,tabpages,winsize
- The internal variable |v:this_session| is not changed when storing the
  session.  Also, it is restored to its old value when logging in again.

The position and size of the GUI window is not saved by Vim since doing so
is the window manager's job.  But if compiled with GTK+ 2 support, Vim helps
the WM to identify the window by restoring the window role (using the |--role|
command line argument).

==============================================================================
7. KDE version					*gui-kde* *kde* *KDE* *KVim*
							*gui-x11-kde*
There is no KDE version of Vim.  There has been some work on a port using the
Qt toolkit, but it never worked properly and it has been abandoned.  Work
continues on Yzis: https://github.com/chrizel/Yzis.

==============================================================================
8. Compiling						*gui-x11-compiling*

If using X11, Vim's configure will by default first try to find the necessary
GTK+ files on your system.  When both GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3 are available, GTK+ 2
will be chosen unless --enable-gui=gtk3 is passed explicitly to configure.

If the GTK+ files cannot be found, then the Motif files will be searched for.
Finally, if this fails, the Athena files will be searched for.  If all three
fail, the GUI will be disabled.

For GTK+, Vim's configuration process uses pkg-config(1) to check if the
GTK+ required for a specified build is properly installed and usable.
Accordingly, it is a good idea to make sure before running configure that
your system has a working pkg-config together with the .pc file of the
required GTK+.  For that, say, run the following on the command line to see if
your pkg-config works with your GTK+ 2: >

    $ pkg-config --modversion gtk+-2.0

Replace gtk+-2.0 with gtk+-3.0 for GTK+ 3. If you get the correct version
number of your GTK+, you can proceed; if not, you probably need to do some
system administration chores to set up pkg-config and GTK+ correctly.

The GTK+ 2 GUI is built by default.  Therefore, you usually don't need to pass
any options such as --enable-gui=gtk2 to configure and build that.

Optionally, the GTK+ 2 GUI can consolidate the GNOME 2 support.  This support
is enabled by passing --enable-gnome-check to configure.

If you want to build the GTK+ 3 GUI, you have to pass --enable-gui=gtk3
explicitly to configure, and avoid passing --enable-gnome-check to that, as
the functionality of the GNOME 2 support has already been consolidated in
GTK+ 3.

Otherwise, if you are using Motif or Athena, when you have the Motif or Athena
files in a directory where configure doesn't look, edit the Makefile to enter
the names of the directories.  Search for "GUI_INC_LOC" for an example to set
the Motif directories, "CONF_OPT_X" for Athena.

							*gui-x11-gtk*
Currently, Vim supports both GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3.

The GTK+ 2 GUI requires GTK+ 2.2 or later.

Although the GTK+ 3 GUI is written in such a way that the source code can be
compiled against all versions of the 3.x series, we recommend GTK+ 3.10 or
later because of its substantial implementation changes in redraw done at
that version.

							*gui-x11-motif*
For Motif, you need at least Motif version 1.2 and/or X11R5.  Motif 2.0 and
X11R6 are OK.  Motif 1.1 and X11R4 might work, no guarantee (there may be a
few problems, but you might make it compile and run with a bit of work, please
send me the patches if you do).  The newest releases of LessTif have been
reported to work fine too.

							*gui-x11-athena*
The Athena version uses the Xaw widget set by default.  If you have the 3D
version, you might want to link with Xaw3d instead.  This will make the
menus look a bit better.  Edit the Makefile and look for "XAW_LIB".  The
scrollbars will remain the same, because Vim has its own, which are already
3D (in fact, they look more like Motif).

							*gui-x11-neXtaw*
The neXtaw version is mostly like Athena, but uses different widgets.

							*gui-x11-misc*
In general, do not try to mix files from different GTK+, Motif, Athena and X11
versions.  This will cause problems.  For example, using header files for
X11R5 with a library for X11R6 probably doesn't work (although the linking
won't give an error message, Vim will crash later).

==============================================================================
9. X11 selection mechanism				*x11-selection*

If using X11, in either the GUI or an xterm with an X11-aware Vim, then Vim
provides varied access to the X11 selection and clipboard.  These are accessed
by using the two selection registers "* and "+.

X11 provides two basic types of global store, selections and cut-buffers,
which differ in one important aspect: selections are "owned" by an
application, and disappear when that application (e.g., Vim) exits, thus
losing the data, whereas cut-buffers, are stored within the X-server itself
and remain until written over or the X-server exits (e.g., upon logging out).

The contents of selections are held by the originating application (e.g., upon
a copy), and only passed on to another application when that other application
asks for them (e.g., upon a paste).

The contents of cut-buffers are immediately written to, and are then
accessible directly from the X-server, without contacting the originating
application.

							*quoteplus* *quote+*
There are three documented X selections: PRIMARY (which is expected to
represent the current visual selection - as in Vim's Visual mode), SECONDARY
(which is ill-defined) and CLIPBOARD (which is expected to be used for
cut, copy and paste operations).

Of these three, Vim uses PRIMARY when reading and writing the "* register
(hence when the X11 selections are available, Vim sets a default value for
|'clipboard'| of "autoselect"), and CLIPBOARD when reading and writing the "+
register.  Vim does not access the SECONDARY selection.

Examples: (assuming the default option values)
- Select an URL in Visual mode in Vim.  Go to your browser and click the
  middle mouse button in the URL text field.  The selected text will be
  inserted (hopefully!).  Note: in Firefox you can set the
  middlemouse.contentLoadURL preference to true in about:config, then the
  selected URL will be used when pressing middle mouse button in most places
  in the window.
- Select some text in your browser by dragging with the mouse.  Go to Vim and
  press the middle mouse button: The selected text is inserted.
- Select some text in Vim and do "+y.  Go to your browser, select some text in
  a textfield by dragging with the mouse.  Now use the right mouse button and
  select "Paste" from the popup menu.  The selected text is overwritten by the
  text from Vim.
Note that the text in the "+ register remains available when making a Visual
selection, which makes other text available in the "* register.  That allows
overwriting selected text.
							*x11-cut-buffer*
There are, by default, 8 cut-buffers: CUT_BUFFER0 to CUT_BUFFER7.  Vim only
uses CUT_BUFFER0, which is the one that xterm uses by default.

Whenever Vim is about to become unavailable (either via exiting or becoming
suspended), and thus unable to respond to another application's selection
request, it writes the contents of any owned selection to CUT_BUFFER0.  If the
"+ CLIPBOARD selection is owned by Vim, then this is written in preference,
otherwise if the "* PRIMARY selection is owned by Vim, then that is written.

Similarly, when Vim tries to paste from "* or "+ (either explicitly, or, in
the case of the "* register, when the middle mouse button is clicked), if the
requested X selection is empty or unavailable, Vim reverts to reading the
current value of the CUT_BUFFER0.

Note that when text is copied to CUT_BUFFER0 in this way, the type of
selection (character, line or block) is always lost, even if it is a Vim which
later pastes it.

Xterm, by default, always writes visible selections to both PRIMARY and
CUT_BUFFER0.  When it pastes, it uses PRIMARY if this is available, or else
falls back upon CUT_BUFFER0.  For this reason, when cutting and pasting
between Vim and an xterm, you should use the "* register.  Xterm doesn't use
CLIPBOARD, thus the "+ doesn't work with xterm.

Most newer applications will provide their current selection via PRIMARY ("*)
and use CLIPBOARD ("+) for cut/copy/paste operations.  You thus have access to
both by choosing to use either of the "* or "+ registers.

Last change: 2007 Jun 14


	   VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Ron Aaron (and Avner Lottem)


Hebrew Language support (options & mapping) for Vim		*hebrew*

The supporting 'rightleft' functionality was originally created by Avner
Lottem. <alottem at gmail dot com>  Ron Aaron <ron at ronware dot org> is
currently helping support these features.

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

All this is only available when the |+rightleft| feature was enabled at
compile time.


Introduction
------------
Hebrew-specific options are 'hkmap', 'hkmapp' 'keymap'=hebrew and 'aleph'.
Hebrew-useful options are 'delcombine', 'allowrevins', 'revins', 'rightleft'
and 'rightleftcmd'.

The 'rightleft' mode reverses the display order, so characters are displayed
from right to left instead of the usual left to right.  This is useful
primarily when editing Hebrew or other Middle-Eastern languages.
See |rileft.txt| for further details.

Details
--------------
+  Options:
   +  'rightleft' ('rl') sets window orientation to right-to-left.  This means
      that the logical text 'ABC' will be displayed as 'CBA', and will start
      drawing at the right edge of the window, not the left edge.
   +  'hkmap' ('hk') sets keyboard mapping to Hebrew, in insert/replace modes.
   +  'aleph' ('al'), numeric, holds the decimal code of Aleph, for keyboard
      mapping.
   +  'hkmapp' ('hkp') sets keyboard mapping to 'phonetic hebrew'

   NOTE: these three ('hkmap', 'hkmapp' and 'aleph') are obsolete.  You should
	 use ":set keymap=hebrewp" instead.

   +  'delcombine' ('deco'), boolean, if editing UTF-8 encoded Hebrew, allows
      one to remove the niqud or te`amim by pressing 'x' on a character (with
      associated niqud).

   +  'rightleftcmd' ('rlc') makes the command-prompt for searches show up on
      the right side.  It only takes effect if the window is 'rightleft'.

+  Encoding:
   +  Under Unix, ISO 8859-8 encoding (Hebrew letters codes: 224-250).
   +  Under MS DOS, PC encoding (Hebrew letters codes: 128-154).
      These are defaults, that can be overridden using the 'aleph' option.
   +  You should prefer using UTF8, as it supports the combining-characters
      ('deco' does nothing if UTF8 encoding is not active).

+  Vim arguments:
   +  'vim -H file' starts editing a Hebrew file, i.e. 'rightleft' and 'hkmap'
      are set.

+  Keyboard:
   +  The 'allowrevins' option enables the CTRL-_ command in Insert mode and
      in Command-line mode.

   +  CTRL-_ in insert/replace modes toggles 'revins' and 'hkmap' as follows:

      When in rightleft window, 'revins' and 'nohkmap' are toggled, since
      English will likely be inserted in this case.

      When in norightleft window, 'revins' 'hkmap' are toggled, since Hebrew
      will likely be inserted in this case.

      CTRL-_ moves the cursor to the end of the typed text.

   +  CTRL-_ in command mode only toggles keyboard mapping (see Bugs below).
      This setting is independent of 'hkmap' option, which only applies to
      insert/replace mode.

      Note: On some keyboards, CTRL-_ is mapped to CTRL-?.

   +  Keyboard mapping while 'hkmap' is set (standard Israeli keyboard):

	q w e r t y u i o p
	/ ' ק ר א ט ו ן ם פ

	 a s d f g h j k l ; '
	 ש ד ג כ ע י ח ל ך ף ,

	  z x c v b n m , . /
	  ז ס ב ה נ מ צ ת ץ .

      This is also the keymap when 'keymap=hebrew' is set.  The advantage of
      'keymap' is that it works properly when using UTF8, e.g. it inserts the
      correct characters; 'hkmap' does not.  The 'keymap' keyboard can also
      insert niqud and te`amim.  To see what those mappings are, look at the
      keymap file 'hebrew.vim' etc.


Typing backwards

If the 'revins' (reverse insert) option is set, inserting happens backwards.
This can be used to type Hebrew.  When inserting characters the cursor is not
moved and the text moves rightwards.  A <BS> deletes the character under the
cursor.  CTRL-W and CTRL-U also work in the opposite direction.  <BS>, CTRL-W
and CTRL-U do not stop at the start of insert or end of line, no matter how
the 'backspace' option is set.

There is no reverse replace mode (yet).

If the 'showmode' option is set, "-- REVERSE INSERT --" will be shown in the
status line when reverse Insert mode is active.

When the 'allowrevins' option is set, reverse Insert mode can be also entered
via CTRL-_, which has some extra functionality: First, keyboard mapping is
changed according to the window orientation -- if in a left-to-right window,
'revins' is used to enter Hebrew text, so the keyboard changes to Hebrew
('hkmap' is set); if in a right-to-left window, 'revins' is used to enter
English text, so the keyboard changes to English ('hkmap' is reset).  Second,
when exiting 'revins' via CTRL-_, the cursor moves to the end of the typed
text (if possible).


Pasting when in a rightleft window
----------------------------------
When cutting text with the mouse and pasting it in a rightleft window
the text will be reversed, because the characters come from the cut buffer
from the left to the right, while inserted in the file from the right to
the left.   In order to avoid it, toggle 'revins' (by typing CTRL-? or CTRL-_)
before pasting.


Hebrew characters and the 'isprint' variable
--------------------------------------------
Sometimes Hebrew character codes are in the non-printable range defined by
the 'isprint' variable.  For example in the Linux console, the Hebrew font
encoding starts from 128, while the default 'isprint' variable is @,161-255.
The result is that all Hebrew characters are displayed as ~x.  To solve this
problem, set isprint=@,128-255.

LOCAL ADDITIONS:				*local-additions*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*bars*		Bars example

Now that you've jumped here with CTRL-] or a double mouse click, you can use
CTRL-T, CTRL-O, g<RightMouse>, or <C-RightMouse> to go back to where you were.

Note that tags are within | characters, but when highlighting is enabled these
characters are hidden.  That makes it easier to read a command.

Anyway, you can use CTRL-] on any word, also when it is not within |, and Vim
will try to find help for it.  Especially for options in single quotes, e.g.
'compatible'.

Help on help files					*helphelp*

1. Help commands		|online-help|
2. Translated help files	|help-translated|
3. Writing help files		|help-writing|

==============================================================================
1. Help commands					*online-help*

			*help* *<Help>* *:h* *:help* *<F1>* *i_<F1>* *i_<Help>*
<Help>		or
:h[elp]			Open a window and display the help file in read-only
			mode.  If there is a help window open already, use
			that one.  Otherwise, if the current window uses the
			full width of the screen or is at least 80 characters
			wide, the help window will appear just above the
			current window.  Otherwise the new window is put at
			the very top.
			The 'helplang' option is used to select a language, if
			the main help file is available in several languages.
			{not in Vi}

						*{subject}* *E149* *E661*
:h[elp] {subject}	Like ":help", additionally jump to the tag {subject}.
			{subject} can include wildcards like "*", "?" and
			"[a-z]":
			   :help z?	jump to help for any "z" command
			   :help z.	jump to the help for "z."
			If there is no full match for the pattern, or there
			are several matches, the "best" match will be used.
			A sophisticated algorithm is used to decide which
			match is better than another one.  These items are
			considered in the computation:
			- A match with same case is much better than a match
			  with different case.
			- A match that starts after a non-alphanumeric
			  character is better than a match in the middle of a
			  word.
			- A match at or near the beginning of the tag is
			  better than a match further on.
			- The more alphanumeric characters match, the better.
			- The shorter the length of the match, the better.

			The 'helplang' option is used to select a language, if
			the {subject} is available in several languages.
			To find a tag in a specific language, append "@ab",
			where "ab" is the two-letter language code.  See
			|help-translated|.

			Note that the longer the {subject} you give, the less
			matches will be found.  You can get an idea how this
			all works by using commandline completion (type CTRL-D
			after ":help subject" |c_CTRL-D|).
			If there are several matches, you can have them listed
			by hitting CTRL-D.  Example: >
				:help cont<Ctrl-D>

<			Instead of typing ":help CTRL-V" to search for help
			for CTRL-V you can type: >
				:help ^V
<			This also works together with other characters, for
			example to find help for CTRL-V in Insert mode: >
				:help i^V
<
			To use a regexp |pattern|, first do ":help" and then
			use ":tag {pattern}" in the help window.  The
			":tnext" command can then be used to jump to other
			matches, "tselect" to list matches and choose one. >
				:help index| :tse z.

<			When there is no argument you will see matches for
			"help", to avoid listing all possible matches (that
			would be very slow).
			The number of matches displayed is limited to 300.

			This command can be followed by '|' and another
			command, but you don't need to escape the '|' inside a
			help command.  So these both work: >
				:help |
				:help k| only
<			Note that a space before the '|' is seen as part of
			the ":help" argument.
			You can also use <LF> or <CR> to separate the help
			command from a following command.  You need to type
			CTRL-V first to insert the <LF> or <CR>.  Example: >
				:help so<C-V><CR>only
<			{not in Vi}

:h[elp]! [subject]	Like ":help", but in non-English help files prefer to
			find a tag in a file with the same language as the
			current file.  See |help-translated|.

						 	*:helpc* *:helpclose*
:helpc[lose]            Close one help window, if there is one.

							*:helpg* *:helpgrep*
:helpg[rep] {pattern}[@xx]
			Search all help text files and make a list of lines
			in which {pattern} matches.  Jumps to the first match.
			The optional [@xx] specifies that only matches in the
			"xx" language are to be found.
			You can navigate through the matches with the
			|quickfix| commands, e.g., |:cnext| to jump to the
			next one.  Or use |:cwindow| to get the list of
			matches in the quickfix window.
			{pattern} is used as a Vim regexp |pattern|.
			'ignorecase' is not used, add "\c" to ignore case.
			Example for case sensitive search: >
				:helpgrep Uganda
<			Example for case ignoring search: >
				:helpgrep uganda\c
<			Example for searching in French help: >
				:helpgrep backspace@fr
<			The pattern does not support line breaks, it must
			match within one line.  You can use |:grep| instead,
			but then you need to get the list of help files in a
			complicated way.
			Cannot be followed by another command, everything is
			used as part of the pattern.  But you can use
			|:execute| when needed.
			Compressed help files will not be searched (Fedora
			compresses the help files).
			{not in Vi}

							*:lh* *:lhelpgrep*
:lh[elpgrep] {pattern}[@xx]
			Same as ":helpgrep", except the location list is used
			instead of the quickfix list.  If the help window is
			already opened, then the location list for that window
			is used.  Otherwise, a new help window is opened and
			the location list for that window is set.  The
			location list for the current window is not changed.

							*:exu* *:exusage*
:exu[sage]		Show help on Ex commands.  Added to simulate the Nvi
			command. {not in Vi}

							*:viu* *:viusage*
:viu[sage]		Show help on Normal mode commands.  Added to simulate
			the Nvi command. {not in Vi}

When no argument is given to |:help| the file given with the 'helpfile' option
will be opened.  Otherwise the specified tag is searched for in all "doc/tags"
files in the directories specified in the 'runtimepath' option.

The initial height of the help window can be set with the 'helpheight' option
(default 20).

Jump to specific subjects by using tags.  This can be done in two ways:
- Use the "CTRL-]" command while standing on the name of a command or option.
  This only works when the tag is a keyword.  "<C-Leftmouse>" and
  "g<LeftMouse>" work just like "CTRL-]".
- use the ":ta {subject}" command.  This also works with non-keyword
  characters.

Use CTRL-T or CTRL-O to jump back.
Use ":q" to close the help window.

If there are several matches for an item you are looking for, this is how you
can jump to each one of them:
1. Open a help window
2. Use the ":tag" command with a slash prepended to the tag.  E.g.: >
	:tag /min
3. Use ":tnext" to jump to the next matching tag.

It is possible to add help files for plugins and other items.  You don't need
to change the distributed help files for that.  See |add-local-help|.

To write a local help file, see |write-local-help|.

Note that the title lines from the local help files are automagically added to
the "LOCAL ADDITIONS" section in the "help.txt" help file |local-additions|.
This is done when viewing the file in Vim, the file itself is not changed.  It
is done by going through all help files and obtaining the first line of each
file.  The files in $VIMRUNTIME/doc are skipped.

							*help-xterm-window*
If you want to have the help in another xterm window, you could use this
command: >
	:!xterm -e vim +help &
<

			*:helpfind* *:helpf*
:helpf[ind]		Like |:help|, but use a dialog to enter the argument.
			Only for backwards compatibility.  It now executes the
			ToolBar.FindHelp menu entry instead of using a builtin
			dialog.  {only when compiled with |+GUI_GTK|}
			{not in Vi}

					*:helpt* *:helptags*
				*E154* *E150* *E151* *E152* *E153* *E670*
:helpt[ags] [++t] {dir}
			Generate the help tags file(s) for directory {dir}.
			When {dir} is ALL then all "doc" directories in
			'runtimepath' will be used.

			All "*.txt" and "*.??x" files in the directory and
			sub-directories are scanned for a help tag definition
			in between stars.  The "*.??x" files are for
			translated docs, they generate the "tags-??" file, see
			|help-translated|.  The generated tags files are
			sorted.
			When there are duplicates an error message is given.
			An existing tags file is silently overwritten.

			The optional "++t" argument forces adding the
			"help-tags" tag.  This is also done when the {dir} is
			equal to $VIMRUNTIME/doc.

			To rebuild the help tags in the runtime directory
			(requires write permission there): >
				:helptags $VIMRUNTIME/doc
<			{not in Vi}


==============================================================================
2. Translated help files				*help-translated*

It is possible to add translated help files, next to the original English help
files.  Vim will search for all help in "doc" directories in 'runtimepath'.
This is only available when compiled with the |+multi_lang| feature.

At this moment translations are available for:
	Chinese  - multiple authors
	French   - translated by David Blanchet
	Italian  - translated by Antonio Colombo
	Japanese - multiple authors
	Polish   - translated by Mikolaj Machowski
	Russian  - translated by Vassily Ragosin
See the Vim website to find them: http://www.vim.org/translations.php

A set of translated help files consists of these files:

	help.abx
	howto.abx
	...
	tags-ab

"ab" is the two-letter language code.  Thus for Italian the names are:

	help.itx
	howto.itx
	...
	tags-it

The 'helplang' option can be set to the preferred language(s).  The default is
set according to the environment.  Vim will first try to find a matching tag
in the preferred language(s).  English is used when it cannot be found.

To find a tag in a specific language, append "@ab" to a tag, where "ab" is the
two-letter language code.  Example: >
	:he user-manual@it
	:he user-manual@en
The first one finds the Italian user manual, even when 'helplang' is empty.
The second one finds the English user manual, even when 'helplang' is set to
"it".

When using command-line completion for the ":help" command, the "@en"
extension is only shown when a tag exists for multiple languages.  When the
tag only exists for English "@en" is omitted.  When the first candidate has an
"@ab" extension and it matches the first language in 'helplang' "@ab" is also
omitted.

When using |CTRL-]| or ":help!" in a non-English help file Vim will try to
find the tag in the same language.  If not found then 'helplang' will be used
to select a language.

Help files must use latin1 or utf-8 encoding.  Vim assumes the encoding is
utf-8 when finding non-ASCII characters in the first line.  Thus you must
translate the header with "For Vim version".

The same encoding must be used for the help files of one language in one
directory.  You can use a different encoding for different languages and use
a different encoding for help files of the same language but in a different
directory.

Hints for translators:
- Do not translate the tags.  This makes it possible to use 'helplang' to
  specify the preferred language.  You may add new tags in your language.
- When you do not translate a part of a file, add tags to the English version,
  using the "tag@en" notation.
- Make a package with all the files and the tags file available for download.
  Users can drop it in one of the "doc" directories and start use it.
  Report this to Bram, so that he can add a link on www.vim.org.
- Use the |:helptags| command to generate the tags files.  It will find all
  languages in the specified directory.

==============================================================================
3. Writing help files					*help-writing*

For ease of use, a Vim help file for a plugin should follow the format of the
standard Vim help files.  If you are writing a new help file it's best to copy
one of the existing files and use it as a template.

The first line in a help file should have the following format:

*helpfile_name.txt*	For Vim version 7.3	Last change: 2010 June 4

The first field is a link to the help file name.  The second field describes
the applicable Vim version.  The last field specifies the last modification
date of the file.  Each field is separated by a tab.

At the bottom of the help file, place a Vim modeline to set the 'textwidth'
and 'tabstop' options and the 'filetype' to 'help'.  Never set a global option
in such a modeline, that can have consequences undesired by whoever reads that
help.


TAGS

To define a help tag, place the name between asterisks (*tag-name*).  The
tag-name should be different from all the Vim help tag names and ideally
should begin with the name of the Vim plugin.  The tag name is usually right
aligned on a line.

When referring to an existing help tag and to create a hot-link, place the
name between two bars (|) eg. |help-writing|.

When referring to a Vim command and to create a hot-link, place the
name between two backticks, eg. inside `:filetype`.  You will see this is
highlighted as a command, like a code block (see below).

When referring to a Vim option in the help file, place the option name between
two single quotes, eg. 'statusline'


HIGHLIGHTING

To define a column heading, use a tilde character at the end of the line.
This will highlight the column heading in a different color.  E.g.

Column heading~

To separate sections in a help file, place a series of '=' characters in a
line starting from the first column.  The section separator line is highlighted
differently.

To quote a block of ex-commands verbatim, place a greater than (>) character
at the end of the line before the block and a less than (<) character as the
first non-blank on a line following the block.  Any line starting in column 1
also implicitly stops the block of ex-commands before it.  E.g. >
    function Example_Func()
	echo "Example"
    endfunction
<

The following are highlighted differently in a Vim help file:
  - a special key name expressed either in <> notation as in <PageDown>, or
    as a Ctrl character as in CTRL-X
  - anything between {braces}, e.g. {lhs} and {rhs}

The word "Note", "Notes" and similar automagically receive distinctive
highlighting.  So do these:
	*Todo	something to do
	*Error	something wrong

You can find the details in $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/help.vim

							*cscope* *Cscope*
This document explains how to use Vim's cscope interface.

Cscope is a tool like ctags, but think of it as ctags on steroids since it
does a lot more than what ctags provides.  In Vim, jumping to a result from
a cscope query is just like jumping to any tag; it is saved on the tag stack
so that with the right keyboard mappings, you can jump back and forth between
functions as you normally would with |tags|.

2. Cscope related commands	|cscope-commands|
3. Cscope options		|cscope-options|
4. How to use cscope in Vim	|cscope-howtouse|
5. Limitations			|cscope-limitations|
6. Suggested usage		|cscope-suggestions|
7. Availability & Information	|cscope-info|

This is currently for Unix and Win32 only.
{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Cscope introduction					*cscope-intro*

The following text is taken from a version of the cscope man page:

				    -----

  Cscope is an interactive screen-oriented tool that helps you:

       Learn how a C program works without endless flipping through a thick
       listing.

       Locate the section of code to change to fix a bug without having to
       learn the entire program.

       Examine the effect of a proposed change such as adding a value to an
       enum variable.

       Verify that a change has been made in all source files such as adding
       an argument to an existing function.

       Rename a global variable in all source files.

       Change a constant to a preprocessor symbol in selected lines of files.

  It is designed to answer questions like:
       Where is this symbol used?
       Where is it defined?
       Where did this variable get its value?
       What is this global symbol's definition?
       Where is this function in the source files?
       What functions call this function?
       What functions are called by this function?
       Where does the message "out of space" come from?
       Where is this source file in the directory structure?
       What files include this header file?

  Cscope answers these questions from a symbol database that it builds the
  first time it is used on the source files.  On a subsequent call, cscope
  rebuilds the database only if a source file has changed or the list of
  source files is different.  When the database is rebuilt the data for the
  unchanged files is copied from the old database, which makes rebuilding
  much faster than the initial build.

				    -----

When cscope is normally invoked, you will get a full-screen selection
screen allowing you to make a query for one of the above questions.
However, once a match is found to your query and you have entered your
text editor to edit the source file containing match, you cannot simply
jump from tag to tag as you normally would with vi's Ctrl-] or :tag
command.

Vim's cscope interface is done by invoking cscope with its line-oriented
interface, and then parsing the output returned from a query.  The end
result is that cscope query results become just like regular tags, so
you can jump to them just like you do with normal tags (Ctrl-] or :tag)
and then go back by popping off the tagstack with Ctrl-T.  (Please note
however, that you don't actually jump to a cscope tag simply by doing
Ctrl-] or :tag without remapping these commands or setting an option.
See the remaining sections on how the cscope interface works and for
suggested use.)


==============================================================================
2. Cscope related commands				*cscope-commands*

		*:cscope* *:cs* *:scs* *:scscope* *E259* *E262* *E561* *E560*
All cscope commands are accessed through suboptions to the main cscope
command ":cscope".  The shortest abbreviation is ":cs".  The ":scscope"
command does the same and also splits the window (short: "scs").

The available subcommands are:

			*E563* *E564* *E566* *E568* *E622* *E623* *E625*
			*E626* *E609*
    add   : Add a new cscope database/connection.

	USAGE	:cs add {file|dir} [pre-path] [flags]

	    [pre-path] is the pathname used with the -P command to cscope.

	    [flags] are any additional flags you want to pass to cscope.

	EXAMPLES >
	    :cscope add /usr/local/cdb/cscope.out
	    :cscope add /projects/vim/cscope.out /usr/local/vim
	    :cscope add cscope.out /usr/local/vim -C
<
				      *cscope-find* *cs-find* *E567*
    find  : Query cscope.  All cscope query options are available
	    except option #5 ("Change this grep pattern").

	USAGE	:cs find {querytype} {name}

	    {querytype} corresponds to the actual cscope line
	    interface numbers as well as default nvi commands:

		0 or s: Find this C symbol
		1 or g: Find this definition
		2 or d: Find functions called by this function
		3 or c: Find functions calling this function
		4 or t: Find this text string
		6 or e: Find this egrep pattern
		7 or f: Find this file
		8 or i: Find files #including this file
		9 or a: Find places where this symbol is assigned a value

	For all types, except 4 and 6, leading white space for {name} is
	removed.  For 4 and 6 there is exactly one space between {querytype}
	and {name}.  Further white space is included in {name}.

	EXAMPLES >
	    :cscope find c vim_free
	    :cscope find 3  vim_free
<
	    These two examples perform the same query: functions calling
	    "vim_free". >

	    :cscope find t initOnce
	    :cscope find t  initOnce
<
	    The first one searches for the text "initOnce", the second one for
	    " initOnce". >

	    :cscope find 0 DEFAULT_TERM
<
	    Executing this example on the source code for Vim 5.1 produces the
	    following output:

	    Cscope tag: DEFAULT_TERM
	       #   line  filename / context / line

	    4. The context of the tag (e.g., global, or the function name).
	    5. The line from the file itself.

    help  : Show a brief synopsis.

	    USAGE   :cs help

							*E261*
    kill  : Kill a cscope connection (or kill all cscope connections).

	    USAGE   :cs kill {num|partial_name}

	    To kill a cscope connection, the connection number or a partial
	    name must be specified.  The partial name is simply any part of
	    the pathname of the cscope database.  Kill a cscope connection
	    using the partial name with caution!

	    If the specified connection number is -1, then _ALL_ cscope
	    connections will be killed.

    reset : Reinit all cscope connections.

	    USAGE   :cs reset

    show  : Show cscope connections.

	    USAGE   :cs show

							*:lcscope* *:lcs*
This command is same as the ":cscope" command, except when the
'cscopequickfix' option is set, the location list for the current window is
used instead of the quickfix list to show the cscope results.

							*:cstag* *E257* *E562*
If you use cscope as well as ctags, |:cstag| allows you to search one or
the other before making a jump.  For example, you can choose to first
search your cscope database(s) for a match, and if one is not found, then
your tags file(s) will be searched.  The order in which this happens
is determined by the value of |csto|.  See |cscope-options| for more
details.

|:cstag| performs the equivalent of ":cs find g" on the identifier when
searching through the cscope database(s).

|:cstag| performs the equivalent of |:tjump| on the identifier when searching
through your tags file(s).


==============================================================================
3. Cscope options					*cscope-options*

Use the |:set| command to set all cscope options.  Ideally, you would do
this in one of your startup files (e.g., .vimrc).  Some cscope related
variables are only valid within |.vimrc|.  Setting them after vim has
started will have no effect!

							*cscopeprg* *csprg*
'cscopeprg' specifies the command to execute cscope.  The default is
"cscope".  For example: >
	:set csprg=/usr/local/bin/cscope
<
					    *cscopequickfix* *csqf* *E469*
{not available when compiled without the |+quickfix| feature}
'cscopequickfix' specifies whether to use quickfix window to show cscope
results.  This is a list of comma-separated values. Each item consists of
|cscope-find| command (s, g, d, c, t, e, f, i or a) and flag (+, - or 0).
'+' indicates that results must be appended to quickfix window,
'-' implies previous results clearance, '0' or command absence - don't use
quickfix.  Search is performed from start until first command occurrence.
The default value is "" (don't use quickfix anyway).  The following value
seems to be useful: >
	:set cscopequickfix=s-,c-,d-,i-,t-,e-,a-
<
							*cscopetag* *cst*
If 'cscopetag' is set, the commands ":tag" and CTRL-] as well as "vim -t"
will always use |:cstag| instead of the default :tag behavior.  Effectively,
by setting 'cst', you will always search your cscope databases as well as
your tag files.  The default is off.  Examples: >
	:set cst
	:set nocst
<
							*cscoperelative* *csre*
If 'cscoperelative' is set, then in absence of a prefix given to cscope
(prefix is the argument of -P option of cscope), basename of cscope.out
location (usually the project root directory) will be used as the prefix
to construct an absolute path.  The default is off.  Note: This option is
only effective when cscope (cscopeprg) is initialized without a prefix
path (-P).  Examples: >
	:set csre
	:set nocsre
<
							*cscopetagorder* *csto*
The value of 'csto' determines the order in which |:cstag| performs a search.
If 'csto' is set to zero, cscope database(s) are searched first, followed
by tag file(s) if cscope did not return any matches.  If 'csto' is set to
one, tag file(s) are searched before cscope database(s).  The default is zero.
Examples: >
	:set csto=0
	:set csto=1
<
						*cscopeverbose* *csverb*
If 'cscopeverbose' is not set (the default), messages will not be printed
indicating success or failure when adding a cscope database.  Ideally, you
should reset this option in your |.vimrc| before adding any cscope databases,
and after adding them, set it.  From then on, when you add more databases
within Vim, you will get a (hopefully) useful message should the database fail
to be added.  Examples: >
	:set csverb
	:set nocsverb
<
						      *cscopepathcomp* *cspc*
The value of 'cspc' determines how many components of a file's path to
display.  With the default value of zero the entire path will be displayed.
The value one will display only the filename with no path.  Other values
display that many components.  For example: >
	:set cspc=3
will display the last 3 components of the file's path, including the file
name itself.

==============================================================================
4. How to use cscope in Vim				*cscope-howtouse*

The first thing you need to do is to build a cscope database for your
source files.  For the most basic case, simply do "cscope -b".  Please
refer to the cscope man page for more details.

Assuming you have a cscope database, you need to "add" the database to Vim.
This establishes a cscope "connection" and makes it available for Vim to use.
You can do this in your .vimrc file, or you can do it manually after starting
vim.  For example, to add the cscope database "cscope.out", you would do:

	:cs add cscope.out

You can double-check the result of this by executing ":cs show".  This will
produce output which looks like this:

 # pid	  database name			      prepend path
 0 28806  cscope.out			      <none>

Note:
Because of the Microsoft RTL limitations, Win32 version shows 0 instead
of the real pid.

Once a cscope connection is established, you can make queries to cscope and
the results will be printed to you.  Queries are made using the command
":cs find".  For example:

	:cs find g ALIGN_SIZE

This can get a little cumbersome since one ends up doing a significant
amount of typing.  Fortunately, there are ways around this by mapping
shortcut keys.  See |cscope-suggestions| for suggested usage.

If the results return only one match, you will automatically be taken to it.
If there is more than one match, you will be given a selection screen to pick
the match you want to go to.  After you have jumped to the new location,
simply hit Ctrl-T to get back to the previous one.


==============================================================================
5. Limitations						*cscope-limitations*

Cscope support for Vim is only available on systems that support these four
system calls: fork(), pipe(), execl(), waitpid().  This means it is mostly
limited to Unix systems.

Additionally Cscope support works for Win32.  For more information and a
cscope version for Win32 see:

	http://iamphet.nm.ru/cscope/index.html

The DJGPP-built version from http://cscope.sourceforge.net is known to not
work with Vim.

Hard-coded limitation: doing a |:tjump| when |:cstag| searches the tag files
is not configurable (e.g., you can't do a tselect instead).

==============================================================================
6. Suggested usage					*cscope-suggestions*

Put these entries in your .vimrc (adjust the pathname accordingly to your
setup): >

	if has("cscope")
		set csprg=/usr/local/bin/cscope
		set csto=0
		set cst
		set nocsverb
		" add any database in current directory
		if filereadable("cscope.out")
		    cs add cscope.out
		" else add database pointed to by environment
		elseif $CSCOPE_DB != ""
		    cs add $CSCOPE_DB
		endif
		set csverb
	endif

By setting 'cscopetag', we have effectively replaced all instances of the :tag
command with :cstag.  This includes :tag, Ctrl-], and "vim -t".  In doing
this, the regular tag command not only searches your ctags generated tag
files, but your cscope databases as well.

Some users may want to keep the regular tag behavior and have a different
shortcut to access :cstag.  For example, one could map Ctrl-_  (underscore)
to :cstag with the following command: >

	map <C-_> :cstag <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

A couple of very commonly used cscope queries (using ":cs find") is to
find all functions calling a certain function and to find all occurrences
of a particular C symbol.  To do this, you can use these mappings as an
example: >

	map g<C-]> :cs find 3 <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	map g<C-\> :cs find 0 <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

These mappings for Ctrl-] (right bracket) and Ctrl-\ (backslash) allow you to
place your cursor over the function name or C symbol and quickly query cscope
for any matches.

Or you may use the following scheme, inspired by Vim/Cscope tutorial from
Cscope Home Page (http://cscope.sourceforge.net/): >

	nmap <C-_>s :cs find s <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>g :cs find g <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>c :cs find c <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>t :cs find t <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>e :cs find e <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>f :cs find f <C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>i :cs find i ^<C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR>$<CR>
	nmap <C-_>d :cs find d <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-_>a :cs find a <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

	" Using 'CTRL-spacebar' then a search type makes the vim window
	" split horizontally, with search result displayed in
	" the new window.

	nmap <C-Space>s :scs find s <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>g :scs find g <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>c :scs find c <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>t :scs find t <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>e :scs find e <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>f :scs find f <C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>i :scs find i ^<C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR>$<CR>
	nmap <C-Space>d :scs find d <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space>a :scs find a <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

	" Hitting CTRL-space *twice* before the search type does a vertical
	" split instead of a horizontal one

	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>s
		\:vert scs find s <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>g
		\:vert scs find g <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>c
		\:vert scs find c <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>t
		\:vert scs find t <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>e
		\:vert scs find e <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>i
		\:vert scs find i ^<C-R>=expand("<cfile>")<CR>$<CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>d
		\:vert scs find d <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>
	nmap <C-Space><C-Space>a
		\:vert scs find a <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>

==============================================================================
7. Cscope availability and information			*cscope-info*

If you do not already have cscope (it did not come with your compiler
license or OS distribution), then you can download it for free from:
	http://cscope.sourceforge.net/
This is released by SCO under the BSD license.

If you want a newer version of cscope, you will probably have to buy it.
According to the (old) nvi documentation:

	You can buy version 13.3 source with an unrestricted license
	for $400 from AT&T Software Solutions by calling +1-800-462-8146.

Also you can download cscope 13.x and mlcscope 14.x (multi-lingual cscope
which supports C, C++, Java, lex, yacc, breakpoint listing, Ingres, and SDL)
from World-Wide Exptools Open Source packages page:
	http://www.bell-labs.com/project/wwexptools/packages.html

In Solaris 2.x, if you have the C compiler license, you will also have
cscope.  Both are usually located under /opt/SUNWspro/bin

SGI developers can also get it.  Search for Cscope on this page:
	http://freeware.sgi.com/index-by-alpha.html
	https://toolbox.sgi.com/toolbox/utilities/cscope/
The second one is for those who have a password for the SGI toolbox.

There is source to an older version of a cscope clone (called "cs") available
on the net.  Due to various reasons, this is not supported with Vim.

The cscope interface/support for Vim was originally written by
Andy Kahn <ackahn@netapp.com>.  The original structure (as well as a tiny
bit of code) was adapted from the cscope interface in nvi.  Please report
any problems, suggestions, patches, et al., you have for the usage of
cscope within Vim to him.
							*cscope-win32*
For a cscope version for Win32 see:
	http://code.google.com/p/cscope-win32/

Win32 support was added by Sergey Khorev <sergey.khorev@gmail.com>.  Contact
him if you have Win32-specific issues.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Luis Carvalho


The Lua Interface to Vim				*lua* *Lua*

1. Commands			|lua-commands|
2. The vim module		|lua-vim|
3. List userdata		|lua-list|
4. Dict userdata		|lua-dict|
5. Funcref userdata		|lua-funcref|
6. Buffer userdata		|lua-buffer|
7. Window userdata		|lua-window|
8. The luaeval function		|lua-luaeval|
9. Dynamic loading		|lua-dynamic|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

The Lua interface is available only when Vim was compiled with the
|+lua| feature.

==============================================================================
1. Commands						*lua-commands*

							*:lua*
:[range]lua {chunk}
			Execute Lua chunk {chunk}.    {not in Vi}

Examples:
>
	:lua print("Hello, Vim!")
	:lua local curbuf = vim.buffer() curbuf[7] = "line #7"
<

:[range]lua << {endmarker}
{script}
{endmarker}
			Execute Lua script {script}.  {not in Vi}
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Lua
			feature wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

{endmarker} must NOT be preceded by any white space.  If {endmarker} is
omitted from after the "<<", a dot '.' must be used after {script}, like
for the |:append| and |:insert| commands.
This form of the |:lua| command is mainly useful for including Lua code
in Vim scripts.

Example:
>
	function! CurrentLineInfo()
	lua << EOF
	local linenr = vim.window().line
	local curline = vim.buffer()[linenr]
	print(string.format("Current line [%d] has %d chars",
		linenr, #curline))
	EOF
	endfunction
<
To see what version of Lua you have: >
	:lua print(_VERSION)

If you use LuaJIT you can also use this: >
	:lua print(jit.version)
<

							*:luado*
:[range]luado {body}	Execute Lua function "function (line, linenr) {body}
			end" for each line in the [range], with the function
			argument being set to the text of each line in turn,
			without a trailing <EOL>, and the current line number.
			If the value returned by the function is a string it
			becomes the text of the line in the current turn. The
			default for [range] is the whole file: "1,$".
							{not in Vi}

Examples:
>
	:luado return string.format("%s\t%d", line:reverse(), #line)

	:lua require"lpeg"
	:lua -- balanced parenthesis grammar:
	:lua bp = lpeg.P{ "(" * ((1 - lpeg.S"()") + lpeg.V(1))^0 * ")" }
	:luado if bp:match(line) then return "-->\t" .. line end
<

							*:luafile*
:[range]luafile {file}
			Execute Lua script in {file}. {not in Vi}
			The whole argument is used as a single file name.

Examples:
>
	:luafile script.lua
	:luafile %
<

All these commands execute a Lua chunk from either the command line (:lua and
:luado) or a file (:luafile) with the given line [range]. Similarly to the Lua
interpreter, each chunk has its own scope and so only global variables are
shared between command calls. All Lua default libraries are available. In
addition, Lua "print" function has its output redirected to the Vim message
area, with arguments separated by a white space instead of a tab.

Lua uses the "vim" module (see |lua-vim|) to issue commands to Vim
and manage buffers (|lua-buffer|) and windows (|lua-window|). However,
procedures that alter buffer content, open new buffers, and change cursor
position are restricted when the command is executed in the |sandbox|.


==============================================================================
2. The vim module					*lua-vim*

Lua interfaces Vim through the "vim" module. The first and last line of the
input range are stored in "vim.firstline" and "vim.lastline" respectively. The
module also includes routines for buffer, window, and current line queries,
Vim evaluation and command execution, and others.

	vim.list([arg])		Returns an empty list or, if "arg" is a Lua
				table with numeric keys 1, ..., n (a
				"sequence"), returns a list l such that l[i] =
				arg[i] for i = 1, ..., n (see |List|).
				Non-numeric keys are not used to initialize
				the list. See also |lua-eval| for conversion
				rules. Example: >
					:lua t = {math.pi, false, say = 'hi'}
					:echo luaeval('vim.list(t)')
					:" [3.141593, 0], 'say' is ignored
<
	vim.dict([arg])		Returns an empty dictionary or, if "arg" is a
				Lua table, returns a dict d such that d[k] =
				arg[k] for all string keys k in "arg" (see
				|Dictionary|). Number keys are converted to
				strings. Keys that are not strings are not
				used to initialize the dictionary. See also
				|lua-eval| for conversion rules. Example: >
					:lua t = {math.pi, false, say = 'hi'}
					:echo luaeval('vim.dict(t)')
					:" {'say': 'hi'}, numeric keys ignored
<
	vim.funcref({name})	Returns a Funcref to function {name} (see
				|Funcref|). It is equivalent to Vim's
				"function". NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

	vim.buffer([arg])	If "arg" is a number, returns buffer with
				number "arg" in the buffer list or, if "arg"
				is a string, returns buffer whose full or short
				name is "arg". In both cases, returns 'nil'
				(nil value, not string) if the buffer is not
				found. Otherwise, if "toboolean(arg)" is
				'true' returns the first buffer in the buffer
				list or else the current buffer.

	vim.window([arg])	If "arg" is a number, returns window with
				number "arg" or 'nil' (nil value, not string)
				if not found. Otherwise, if "toboolean(arg)"
				is 'true' returns the first window or else the
				current window.

	vim.type({arg})		Returns the type of {arg}. It is equivalent to
				Lua's "type" function, but returns "list",
				"dict", "funcref", "buffer", or "window" if
				{arg} is a list, dictionary, funcref, buffer,
				or window, respectively. Examples: >
					:lua l = vim.list()
					:lua print(type(l), vim.type(l))
					:" userdata list
<
	vim.command({cmd})	Executes the vim (ex-mode) command {cmd}.
				Examples: >
					:lua vim.command"set tw=60"
					:lua vim.command"normal ddp"
<
	vim.eval({expr})	Evaluates expression {expr} (see |expression|),
				converts the result to Lua, and returns it.
				Vim strings and numbers are directly converted
				to Lua strings and numbers respectively. Vim
				lists and dictionaries are converted to Lua
				userdata (see |lua-list| and |lua-dict|).
				Examples: >
					:lua tw = vim.eval"&tw"
					:lua print(vim.eval"{'a': 'one'}".a)
<
	vim.line()		Returns the current line (without the trailing
				<EOL>), a Lua string.

	vim.beep()		Beeps.

	vim.open({fname})	Opens a new buffer for file {fname} and
				returns it. Note that the buffer is not set as
				current.


==============================================================================
3. List userdata					*lua-list*

List userdata represent vim lists, and the interface tries to follow closely
Vim's syntax for lists. Since lists are objects, changes in list references in
Lua are reflected in Vim and vice-versa. A list "l" has the following
properties and methods:

Properties
----------
	o "#l" is the number of items in list "l", equivalent to "len(l)"
	    in Vim.
	o "l[k]" returns the k-th item in "l"; "l" is zero-indexed, as in Vim.
	    To modify the k-th item, simply do "l[k] = newitem"; in
	    particular, "l[k] = nil" removes the k-th item from "l".
	o "l()" returns an iterator for "l".

Methods
-------
	o "l:add(item)" appends "item" to the end of "l".
	o "l:insert(item[, pos])" inserts "item" at (optional)
	    position "pos" in the list. The default value for "pos" is 0.

Examples:
>
	:let l = [1, 'item']
	:lua l = vim.eval('l') -- same 'l'
	:lua l:add(vim.list())
	:lua l[0] = math.pi
	:echo l[0] " 3.141593
	:lua l[0] = nil -- remove first item
	:lua l:insert(true, 1)
	:lua print(l, #l, l[0], l[1], l[-1])
	:lua for item in l() do print(item) end
<

==============================================================================
4. Dict userdata					*lua-dict*

Similarly to list userdata, dict userdata represent vim dictionaries; since
dictionaries are also objects, references are kept between Lua and Vim. A dict
"d" has the following properties:

Properties
----------
	o "#d" is the number of items in dict "d", equivalent to "len(d)"
	    in Vim.
	o "d.key" or "d['key']" returns the value at entry "key" in "d".
	    To modify the entry at this key, simply do "d.key = newvalue"; in
	    particular, "d.key = nil" removes the entry from "d".
	o "d()" returns an iterator for "d" and is equivalent to "items(d)" in
	    Vim.

Examples:
>
	:let d = {'n':10}
	:lua d = vim.eval('d') -- same 'd'
	:lua print(d, d.n, #d)
	:let d.self = d
	:lua for k, v in d() do print(d, k, v) end
	:lua d.x = math.pi
	:lua d.self = nil -- remove entry
	:echo d
<

==============================================================================
5. Funcref userdata					*lua-funcref*

Funcref userdata represent funcref variables in Vim. Funcrefs that were
defined with a "dict" attribute need to be obtained as a dictionary key
in order to have "self" properly assigned to the dictionary (see examples
below.) A funcref "f" has the following properties:

Properties
----------
	o "#f" is the name of the function referenced by "f"
	o "f(...)" calls the function referenced by "f" (with arguments)

Examples:
>
	:function I(x)
	:  return a:x
	:  endfunction
	:let R = function('I')
	:lua i1 = vim.funcref('I')
	:lua i2 = vim.eval('R')
	:lua print(#i1, #i2) -- both 'I'
	:lua print(i1, i2, #i2(i1) == #i1(i2))
	:function Mylen() dict
	:  return len(self.data)
	:  endfunction
	:let mydict = {'data': [0, 1, 2, 3]}
	:lua d = vim.eval('mydict'); d.len = vim.funcref('Mylen')

	:lua l = d.len -- assign d as 'self'
	:lua print(l())

6. Buffer userdata					*lua-buffer*

Buffer userdata represent vim buffers. A buffer userdata "b" has the following
properties and methods:

Properties
----------
	o "b()" sets "b" as the current buffer.
	o "#b" is the number of lines in buffer "b".
	o "b[k]" represents line number k: "b[k] = newline" replaces line k
	    with string "newline" and "b[k] = nil" deletes line k.
	o "b.name" contains the short name of buffer "b" (read-only).
	o "b.fname" contains the full name of buffer "b" (read-only).
	o "b.number" contains the position of buffer "b" in the buffer list
	    (read-only).

Methods
-------
	o "b:insert(newline[, pos])" inserts string "newline" at (optional)
	    position "pos" in the buffer. The default value for "pos" is
	    "#b + 1". If "pos == 0" then "newline" becomes the first line in
	    the buffer.
	o "b:next()" returns the buffer next to "b" in the buffer list.
	o "b:previous()" returns the buffer previous to "b" in the buffer
	    list.
	o "b:isvalid()" returns 'true' (boolean) if buffer "b" corresponds to
	    a "real" (not freed from memory) Vim buffer.

Examples:
>
	:lua b = vim.buffer() -- current buffer
	:lua print(b.name, b.number)
	:lua b[1] = "first line"
	:lua b:insert("FIRST!", 0)
	:lua b[1] = nil -- delete top line
	:lua for i=1,3 do b:insert(math.random()) end
	:3,4lua for i=vim.lastline,vim.firstline,-1 do b[i] = nil end
	:lua vim.open"myfile"() -- open buffer and set it as current

	function! ListBuffers()
	lua << EOF
	local b = vim.buffer(true) -- first buffer in list
	while b ~= nil do
		print(b.number, b.name, #b)
		b = b:next()
	end
	vim.beep()
	EOF
	endfunction
<

==============================================================================
7. Window userdata					*lua-window*

Window objects represent vim windows. A window userdata "w" has the following
properties and methods:

Properties
----------
	o "w()" sets "w" as the current window.
	o "w.buffer" contains the buffer of window "w" (read-only).
	o "w.line" represents the cursor line position in window "w".
	o "w.col" represents the cursor column position in window "w".
	o "w.width" represents the width of window "w".
	o "w.height" represents the height of window "w".

Methods
-------
	o "w:next()" returns the window next to "w".
	o "w:previous()" returns the window previous to "w".
	o "w:isvalid()" returns 'true' (boolean) if window "w" corresponds to
	    a "real" (not freed from memory) Vim window.

Examples:
>
	:lua w = vim.window() -- current window
	:lua print(w.buffer.name, w.line, w.col)
	:lua w.width = w.width + math.random(10)
	:lua w.height = 2 * math.random() * w.height
	:lua n,w = 0,vim.window(true) while w~=nil do n,w = n + 1,w:next() end
	:lua print("There are " .. n .. " windows")
<

==============================================================================
8. The luaeval function					*lua-luaeval* *lua-eval*

The (dual) equivalent of "vim.eval" for passing Lua values to Vim is
"luaeval". "luaeval" takes an expression string and an optional argument and
returns the result of the expression. It is semantically equivalent in Lua to:
>
	local chunkheader = "local _A = select(1, ...) return "
	function luaeval (expstr, arg)
	    local chunk = assert(loadstring(chunkheader .. expstr, "luaeval"))
	    return chunk(arg) -- return typval
	end
<
Note that "_A" receives the argument to "luaeval". Lua numbers, strings, and
list, dict, and funcref userdata are converted to their Vim respective types,
while Lua booleans are converted to numbers. An error is thrown if conversion
of any of the remaining Lua types, including userdata other than lists, dicts,
and funcrefs, is attempted.

Examples: >

	:echo luaeval('math.pi')
	:lua a = vim.list():add('newlist')
	:let a = luaeval('a')
	:echo a[0] " 'newlist'
	:function Rand(x,y) " random uniform between x and y
	:  return luaeval('(_A.y-_A.x)*math.random()+_A.x', {'x':a:x,'y':a:y})
	:  endfunction
	:echo Rand(1,10)


==============================================================================
9. Dynamic loading				    *lua-dynamic*

On MS-Windows and Unix the Lua library can be loaded dynamically.  The
|:version| output then includes |+lua/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the Lua DLL or shared library file only
when needed.  When you don't use the Lua interface you don't need it, thus
you can use Vim without this file.


MS-Windows ~

To use the Lua interface the Lua DLL must be in your search path.  In a
console window type "path" to see what directories are used.  The 'luadll'
option can be also used to specify the Lua DLL.  The version of the DLL must
match the Lua version Vim was compiled with.


Unix ~

The 'luadll' option can be used to specify the Lua shared library file instead
of DYNAMIC_LUA_DLL file what was specified at compile time.  The version of
the shared library must match the Lua version Vim was compiled with.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Sergey Khorev


The MzScheme Interface to Vim				*mzscheme* *MzScheme*

1. Commands				|mzscheme-commands|
2. Examples				|mzscheme-examples|
3. Threads				|mzscheme-threads|
4. Vim access from MzScheme		|mzscheme-vim|
5. mzeval() Vim function		|mzscheme-mzeval|
6. Using Function references		|mzscheme-funcref|
7. Dynamic loading			|mzscheme-dynamic|
8. MzScheme setup			|mzscheme-setup|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

The MzScheme interface is available only if Vim was compiled with the
|+mzscheme| feature.

Based on the work of Brent Fulgham.
Dynamic loading added by Sergey Khorev

MzScheme and PLT Scheme names have been rebranded as Racket. For more
information please check http://racket-lang.org

Futures and places of Racket version 5.x up to and including 5.3.1 do not
work correctly with processes created by Vim.
The simplest solution is to build Racket on your own with these features
disabled: >
  ./configure --disable-futures --disable-places --prefix=your-install-prefix

To speed up the process, you might also want to use --disable-gracket and
--disable-docs

==============================================================================
1. Commands						*mzscheme-commands*

							*:mzscheme* *:mz*
:[range]mz[scheme] {stmt}
			Execute MzScheme statement {stmt}.  {not in Vi}

:[range]mz[scheme] << {endmarker}
{script}
{endmarker}
			Execute inlined MzScheme script {script}.
			Note: This command doesn't work if the MzScheme
			feature wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

							*:mzfile* *:mzf*
:[range]mzf[ile] {file}	Execute the MzScheme script in {file}.  {not in Vi}

All of these commands do essentially the same thing - they execute a piece of
MzScheme code, with the "current range" set to the given line
range.

In the case of :mzscheme, the code to execute is in the command-line.
In the case of :mzfile, the code to execute is the contents of the given file.

MzScheme interface defines exception exn:vim, derived from exn.
It is raised for various Vim errors.

During compilation, the MzScheme interface will remember the current MzScheme
collection path. If you want to specify additional paths use the
'current-library-collection-paths' parameter. E.g., to cons the user-local
MzScheme collection path: >
    :mz << EOF
    (current-library-collection-paths
	(cons
	    (build-path (find-system-path 'addon-dir) (version) "collects")
	    (current-library-collection-paths)))
    EOF
<

All functionality is provided through module vimext.

The exn:vim is available without explicit import.

To avoid clashes with MzScheme, consider using prefix when requiring module,
e.g.: >
	:mzscheme (require (prefix vim- vimext))
<
All the examples below assume this naming scheme. 

							*mzscheme-sandbox*
When executed in the |sandbox|, access to some filesystem and Vim interface
procedures is restricted.

==============================================================================
2. Examples						*mzscheme-examples*
>
	:mzscheme (display "Hello")
	:mz (display (string-append "Using MzScheme version " (version)))
	:mzscheme (require (prefix vim- vimext)) ; for MzScheme < 4.x
	:mzscheme (require (prefix-in vim- 'vimext)) ; MzScheme 4.x
	:mzscheme (vim-set-buff-line 10 "This is line #10")

To see what version of MzScheme you have: >
	:mzscheme (display (version))
<
Inline script usage: >
	function! <SID>SetFirstLine()
	    :mz << EOF
	    (display "!!!")
	    (require (prefix vim- vimext))
	    ; for newer versions (require (prefix-in vim- 'vimext))
	    (vim-set-buff-line 1 "This is line #1")
	    (vim-beep)

	; for newer versions (require (prefix-in vim- 'vimext))
	(with-handlers
	  ([exn:vim? (lambda (e) (display (exn-message e)))])
	  (vim-eval "nonsense-string"))
	EOF

    function! MzRequire()
	:redir => l:mzversion
	:mz (version)
	:redir END
	if strpart(l:mzversion, 1, 1) < "4"
	    " MzScheme versions < 4.x:
	    :mz (require (prefix vim- vimext))
	else
	    " newer versions:
	    :mz (require (prefix-in vim- 'vimext))
	endif
    endfunction

    if has("mzscheme")
	silent call MzRequire()
    endif
<
==============================================================================
3. Threads						*mzscheme-threads*

The MzScheme interface supports threads. They are independent from OS threads,
thus scheduling is required. The option 'mzquantum' determines how often
Vim should poll for available MzScheme threads.
NOTE
Thread scheduling in the console version of Vim is less reliable than in the
GUI version.

==============================================================================
4. Vim access from MzScheme				*mzscheme-vim*

							*mzscheme-vimext*
The 'vimext' module provides access to procedures defined in the MzScheme
interface.

Common
------
    (command {command-string})	    Perform the vim ":Ex" style command.
    (eval {expr-string})	    Evaluate the vim expression into
				    respective MzScheme object: |Lists| are
				    represented as Scheme lists,
				    |Dictionaries| as hash tables,
				    |Funcref|s as functions (see also
				    |mzscheme-funcref|)
				    NOTE the name clashes with MzScheme eval,
				    use module qualifiers to overcome this.
    (range-start)		    Start/End of the range passed with
    (range-end)			    the Scheme command.
    (beep)			    beep
    (get-option {option-name} [buffer-or-window]) Get Vim option value (either
				    local or global, see set-option).
    (set-option {string} [buffer-or-window])
				    Set a Vim option. String must have option
				    setting form (like optname=optval, or
				    optname+=optval, etc.) When called with
				    {buffer} or {window} the local option will
				    be set. The symbol 'global can be passed
				    as {buffer-or-window}. Then |:setglobal|
				    will be used.

Buffers							 *mzscheme-buffer*
-------
    (buff? {object})		    Is object a buffer?
    (buff-valid? {object})	    Is object a valid buffer? (i.e.
				    corresponds to the real Vim buffer)
    (get-buff-line {linenr} [buffer])
				    Get line from a buffer.
    (set-buff-line {linenr} {string} [buffer])
				    Set a line in a buffer. If {string} is #f,
				    the line gets deleted.  The [buffer]
				    argument is optional. If omitted, the
				    current buffer will be used.
    (get-buff-line-list {start} {end} [buffer])
				    Get a list of lines in a buffer. {Start}
				    and {end} are 1-based and inclusive.
    (set-buff-line-list {start} {end} {string-list} [buffer])
				    Set a list of lines in a buffer. If
				    string-list is #f or null, the lines get
				    deleted. If a list is shorter than
				    {end}-{start} the remaining lines will
				    be deleted.
    (get-buff-name [buffer])	    Get a buffer's text name.
    (get-buff-num [buffer])	    Get a buffer's number.
    (get-buff-size [buffer])	    Get buffer line count.
    (insert-buff-line-list {linenr} {string/string-list} [buffer])
				    Insert a list of lines into a buffer after
				    {linenr}. If {linenr} is 0, lines will be
				    inserted at start.
    (curr-buff)			    Get the current buffer. Use other MzScheme
				    interface procedures to change it.
    (buff-count)		    Get count of total buffers in the editor.
    (get-next-buff [buffer])	    Get next buffer.
    (get-prev-buff [buffer])	    Get previous buffer. Return #f when there
				    are no more buffers.
    (open-buff {filename})	    Open a new buffer (for file "name")
    (get-buff-by-name {buffername}) Get a buffer by its filename or #f
					if there is no such buffer.
    (get-buff-by-num {buffernum})   Get a buffer by its number (return #f if
				    there is no buffer with this number).

Windows							    *mzscheme-window*
------
    (win? {object})		    Is object a window?
    (win-valid? {object})	    Is object a valid window (i.e. corresponds
				    to the real Vim window)?
    (curr-win)			    Get the current window.
    (win-count)			    Get count of windows.
    (get-win-num [window])	    Get window number.
    (get-win-by-num {windownum})    Get window by its number.
    (get-win-buffer	[window])   Get the buffer for a given window.
    (get-win-height [window])
    (set-win-height {height} [window])  Get/Set height of window.
    (get-win-width [window])
    (set-win-width {width} [window])Get/Set width of window.
    (get-win-list [buffer])	    Get list of windows for a buffer.
    (get-cursor [window])	    Get cursor position in a window as
				    a pair (linenr . column).
    (set-cursor (line . col) [window])  Set cursor position.

==============================================================================
5. mzeval() Vim function				    *mzscheme-mzeval*

To facilitate bi-directional interface, you can use |mzeval()| function to
evaluate MzScheme expressions and pass their values to VimL.

==============================================================================
6. Using Function references				    *mzscheme-funcref*

MzScheme interface allows use of |Funcref|s so you can call Vim functions
directly from Scheme. For instance: >
    function! MyAdd2(arg)
	return a:arg + 2
    endfunction
    mz (define f2 (vim-eval "function(\"MyAdd2\")"))
    mz (f2 7)
< or : >
    :mz (define indent (vim-eval "function('indent')"))
    " return Vim indent for line 12
    :mz (indent 12)
<

==============================================================================
7. Dynamic loading				*mzscheme-dynamic* *E815*

On MS-Windows the MzScheme libraries can be loaded dynamically. The |:version|
output then includes |+mzscheme/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the MzScheme DLL files only when needed.
When you don't use the MzScheme interface you don't need them, thus you can
use Vim without these DLL files.
NOTE: Newer version of MzScheme (Racket) require earlier (trampolined)
initialisation via scheme_main_setup.  So Vim always loads the MzScheme DLL at
startup if possible.

To use the MzScheme interface the MzScheme DLLs must be in your search path.
In a console window type "path" to see what directories are used.

The names of the DLLs must match the MzScheme version Vim was compiled with.
For MzScheme version 209 they will be "libmzsch209_000.dll" and
"libmzgc209_000.dll". To know for sure look at the output of the ":version"
command, look for -DDYNAMIC_MZSCH_DLL="something" and
-DDYNAMIC_MZGC_DLL="something" in the "Compilation" info.

For example, if MzScheme (Racket) is installed at C:\Racket63, you may need
to set the environment variable as the following: >

  PATH=%PATH%;C:\Racket63\lib
  PLTCOLLECTS=C:\Racket63\collects
  PLTCONFIGDIR=C:\Racket63\etc
<
==============================================================================
8. MzScheme setup				    *mzscheme-setup* *E895*

Vim requires "racket/base" module for if_mzsch core (fallback to "scheme/base"
if it doesn't exist), "r5rs" module for test and "raco ctool" command for
building Vim.  If MzScheme did not have them, you can install them with
MzScheme's raco command:
>
  raco pkg install scheme-lib       # scheme/base module
  raco pkg install r5rs-lib         # r5rs module
  raco pkg install cext-lib         # raco ctool command
<

The OLE Interface to Vim				*ole-interface*

1. Activation			|ole-activation|
2. Methods			|ole-methods|
3. The "normal" command		|ole-normal|
4. Registration			|ole-registration|
5. MS Visual Studio integration	|MSVisualStudio|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

OLE is only available when compiled with the |+ole| feature.  See
src/if_ole.INSTALL.
An alternative is using the client-server communication |clientserver|.

==============================================================================
1. Activation						*ole-activation*

Vim acts as an OLE automation server, accessible from any automation client,
for example, Visual Basic, Python, or Perl.  The Vim application "name" (its
"ProgID", in OLE terminology) is "Vim.Application".

Hence, in order to start a Vim instance (or connect to an already running
instance), code similar to the following should be used:

[Visual Basic] >
	Dim Vim As Object
	Set Vim = CreateObject("Vim.Application")

[Python] >
	from win32com.client.dynamic import Dispatch
	vim = Dispatch('Vim.Application')

[Perl] >
	use Win32::OLE;
	$vim = new Win32::OLE 'Vim.Application';

[C#] >
        // Add a reference to VIM in your project. 
        // Choose the COM tab.
        // Select "VIM Ole Interface 1.1 Type Library"
	Vim.Vim vimobj = new Vim.Vim();

Vim does not support acting as a "hidden" OLE server, like some other OLE
Automation servers.  When a client starts up an instance of Vim, that instance
is immediately visible.  Simply closing the OLE connection to the Vim instance
is not enough to shut down the Vim instance - it is necessary to explicitly
execute a quit command (for example, :qa!, :wqa).

==============================================================================
2. Methods						*ole-methods*

Vim exposes four methods for use by clients.

							*ole-sendkeys*
SendKeys(keys)		Execute a series of keys.

This method takes a single parameter, which is a string of keystrokes.  These
keystrokes are executed exactly as if they had been types in at the keyboard.
Special keys can be given using their <..> names, as for the right hand side
of a mapping.  Note: Execution of the Ex "normal" command is not supported -
see below |ole-normal|.

Examples (Visual Basic syntax) >
	Vim.SendKeys "ihello<Esc>"
	Vim.SendKeys "ma1GV4jy`a"

These examples assume that Vim starts in Normal mode.  To force Normal mode,
start the key sequence with CTRL-\ CTRL-N as in >

	Vim.SendKeys "<C-\><C-N>ihello<Esc>"

CTRL-\ CTRL-N returns Vim to Normal mode, when in Insert or Command-line mode.
Note that this doesn't work halfway a Vim command

							*ole-eval*
Eval(expr)		Evaluate an expression.

This method takes a single parameter, which is an expression in Vim's normal
format (see |expression|).  It returns a string, which is the result of
evaluating the expression.  A |List| is turned into a string by joining the
items and inserting line breaks.

Examples (Visual Basic syntax) >
	Line20 = Vim.Eval("getline(20)")
	Twelve = Vim.Eval("6 + 6")		' Note this is a STRING
	Font = Vim.Eval("&guifont")
<
							*ole-setforeground*
SetForeground()		Make the Vim window come to the foreground

This method takes no arguments.  No value is returned.

Example (Visual Basic syntax) >
	Vim.SetForeground
<

							*ole-gethwnd*
GetHwnd()		Return the handle of the Vim window.

This method takes no arguments.  It returns the hwnd of the main Vimwindow.
You can use this if you are writing something which needs to manipulate the
Vim window, or to track it in the z-order, etc.

Example (Visual Basic syntax) >
	Vim_Hwnd = Vim.GetHwnd
<

==============================================================================
3. The "normal" command					*ole-normal*

Due to the way Vim processes OLE Automation commands, combined with the method
of implementation of the Ex command :normal, it is not possible to execute the
:normal command via OLE automation.  Any attempt to do so will fail, probably
harmlessly, although possibly in unpredictable ways.

There is currently no practical way to trap this situation, and users must
simply be aware of the limitation.
==============================================================================
4. Registration					*ole-registration* *E243*

Before Vim will act as an OLE server, it must be registered in the system
registry.  In order to do this, Vim should be run with a single parameter of
"-register".
							*-register*  >
	gvim -register

If gvim with OLE support is run and notices that no Vim OLE server has been
registered, it will present a dialog and offers you the choice to register by
clicking "Yes".

In some situations registering is not possible.  This happens when the
registry is not writable.  If you run into this problem you need to run gvim
as "Administrator".

Once vim is registered, the application path is stored in the registry.
Before moving, deleting, or upgrading Vim, the registry entries should be
removed using the "-unregister" switch.
							*-unregister*  >
	gvim -unregister

The OLE mechanism will use the first registered Vim it finds.  If a Vim is
already running, this one will be used.  If you want to have (several) Vim
sessions open that should not react to OLE commands, use the non-OLE version,
and put it in a different directory.  The OLE version should then be put in a
directory that is not in your normal path, so that typing "gvim" will start
the non-OLE version.

							*-silent*
To avoid the message box that pops up to report the result, prepend "-silent":
>
	gvim -silent -register
	gvim -silent -unregister

==============================================================================
5. MS Visual Studio integration			*MSVisualStudio* *VisVim*

The OLE version can be used to run Vim as the editor in Microsoft Visual
Studio.  This is called "VisVim".  It is included in the archive that contains
the OLE version.  The documentation can be found in the runtime directory, the
README_VisVim.txt file.


Using Vim with Visual Studio .Net~

With .Net you no longer really need VisVim, since .Net studio has support for
external editors.  Follow these directions:

In .Net Studio choose from the menu Tools->External Tools...
Add
     Title     - Vim
     Command   - c:\vim\vim63\gvim.exe
     Arguments - --servername VS_NET --remote-silent "+call cursor($(CurLine), $(CurCol))" $(ItemPath)
     Init Dir  - Empty

Now, when you open a file in .Net, you can choose from the .Net menu:
Tools->Vim

That will open the file in Vim.
You can then add this external command as an icon and place it anywhere you
like.  You might also be able to set this as your default editor.

If you refine this further, please post back to the Vim maillist so we have a
record of it.

--servername VS_NET
This will create a new instance of vim called VS_NET.  So if you open multiple
files from VS, they will use the same instance of Vim.  This allows you to
have multiple copies of Vim running, but you can control which one has VS
files in it.

--remote-silent "+call cursor(10, 27)"
	      - Places the cursor on line 10 column 27
In Vim >
   :h --remote-silent for more details

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Sven Verdoolaege
					 and Matt Gerassimof

Perl and Vim				*perl* *Perl*

1. Editing Perl files			|perl-editing|
2. Compiling VIM with Perl interface	|perl-compiling|
3. Using the Perl interface		|perl-using|
4. Dynamic loading			|perl-dynamic|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

The Perl interface only works when Vim was compiled with the |+perl| feature.

==============================================================================
1. Editing Perl files					*perl-editing*

Vim syntax highlighting supports Perl and POD files.  Vim assumes a file is
Perl code if the filename has a .pl or .pm suffix.  Vim also examines the first
line of a file, regardless of the filename suffix, to check if a file is a
Perl script (see scripts.vim in Vim's syntax directory).  Vim assumes a file
is POD text if the filename has a .POD suffix.

To use tags with Perl, you need a recent version of Exuberant ctags.  Look
here:
	http://ctags.sourceforge.net

Alternatively, you can use the Perl script pltags.pl, which is shipped with
Vim in the $VIMRUNTIME/tools directory.  This script has currently more
features than Exuberant ctags' Perl support.

==============================================================================
2. Compiling VIM with Perl interface			*perl-compiling*

To compile Vim with Perl interface, you need Perl 5.004 (or later).  Perl must
be installed before you compile Vim.  Vim's Perl interface does NOT work with
the 5.003 version that has been officially released!  It will probably work
with Perl 5.003_05 and later.

The Perl patches for Vim were made by:
	Sven Verdoolaege <skimo@breughel.ufsia.ac.be>
	Matt Gerassimof

Perl for MS-Windows can be found at: http://www.perl.com/
The ActiveState one should work.

==============================================================================
3. Using the Perl interface				*perl-using*

							*:perl* *:pe*
:pe[rl] {cmd}		Execute Perl command {cmd}.  The current package
			is "main".  Simple example to test if `:perl` is
			working: >
				:perl VIM::Msg("Hello")

:pe[rl] << {endpattern}
{script}
{endpattern}
			Execute Perl script {script}.
			{endpattern} must NOT be preceded by any white space.
			If {endpattern} is omitted, it defaults to a dot '.'
			like for the |:append| and |:insert| commands.  Using
			'.' helps when inside a function, because "$i;" looks
			like the start of an |:insert| command to Vim.
			This form of the |:perl| command is mainly useful for
			including perl code in vim scripts.
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Perl feature
			wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.


Example vim script: >

	function! WhitePearl()
	perl << EOF
		VIM::Msg("pearls are nice for necklaces");
		VIM::Msg("rubys for rings");
		VIM::Msg("pythons for bags");
		VIM::Msg("tcls????");
	EOF
	endfunction
<
To see what version of Perl you have: >
	:perl print $^V
<

							*:perldo* *:perld*
:[range]perld[o] {cmd}	Execute Perl command {cmd} for each line in the
			[range], with $_ being set to the text of each line in
			turn, without a trailing <EOL>.  Setting $_ will change
			the text, but note that it is not possible to add or
			delete lines using this command.
			The default for [range] is the whole file: "1,$".

Here are some things you can try: >

  :perl $a=1
  :perldo $_ = reverse($_);1
  :perl VIM::Msg("hello")
  :perl $line = $curbuf->Get(42)
<
							*E299*
Executing Perl commands in the |sandbox| is limited.  ":perldo" will not be
possible at all.  ":perl" will be evaluated in the Safe environment, if
possible.


							*perl-overview*
Here is an overview of the functions that are available to Perl: >

  :perl VIM::Msg("Text")		# displays a message
  :perl VIM::Msg("Error", "ErrorMsg")	# displays an error message
  :perl VIM::Msg("remark", "Comment")	# displays a highlighted message
  :perl VIM::SetOption("ai")		# sets a vim option
  :perl $nbuf = VIM::Buffers()		# returns the number of buffers
  :perl @buflist = VIM::Buffers()	# returns array of all buffers
  :perl $mybuf = (VIM::Buffers('qq.c'))[0] # returns buffer object for 'qq.c'
  :perl @winlist = VIM::Windows()	# returns array of all windows
  :perl $nwin = VIM::Windows()		# returns the number of windows
  :perl ($success, $v) = VIM::Eval('&path') # $v: option 'path', $success: 1
  :perl ($success, $v) = VIM::Eval('&xyz')  # $v: '' and $success: 0
  :perl $v = VIM::Eval('expand("<cfile>")') # expands <cfile>
  :perl $curwin->SetHeight(10)		# sets the window height
  :perl @pos = $curwin->Cursor()	# returns (row, col) array
  :perl @pos = (10, 10)
  :perl $curwin->Cursor(@pos)		# sets cursor to @pos
  :perl $curwin->Cursor(10,10)		# sets cursor to row 10 col 10
  :perl $mybuf = $curwin->Buffer()	# returns the buffer object for window
  :perl $curbuf->Name()			# returns buffer name
  :perl $curbuf->Number()		# returns buffer number
  :perl $curbuf->Count()		# returns the number of lines
  :perl $l = $curbuf->Get(10)		# returns line 10
  :perl @l = $curbuf->Get(1 .. 5)	# returns lines 1 through 5
  :perl $curbuf->Delete(10)		# deletes line 10
  :perl $curbuf->Delete(10, 20)		# delete lines 10 through 20
  :perl $curbuf->Append(10, "Line")	# appends a line
  :perl $curbuf->Append(10, "Line1", "Line2", "Line3") # appends 3 lines
  :perl @l = ("L1", "L2", "L3")
  :perl $curbuf->Append(10, @l)		# appends L1, L2 and L3
  :perl $curbuf->Set(10, "Line")	# replaces line 10
  :perl $curbuf->Set(10, "Line1", "Line2")	# replaces lines 10 and 11
  :perl $curbuf->Set(10, @l)		# replaces 3 lines
<
							*perl-Msg*
VIM::Msg({msg}, {group}?)
			Displays the message {msg}.  The optional {group}
			argument specifies a highlight group for Vim to use
			for the message.

							*perl-SetOption*
VIM::SetOption({arg})	Sets a vim option.  {arg} can be any argument that the
			":set" command accepts.  Note that this means that no
			spaces are allowed in the argument!  See |:set|.

							*perl-Buffers*
VIM::Buffers([{bn}...])	With no arguments, returns a list of all the buffers
			in an array context or returns the number of buffers
			in a scalar context.  For a list of buffer names or
			numbers {bn}, returns a list of the buffers matching
			{bn}, using the same rules as Vim's internal
			|bufname()| function.
			WARNING: the list becomes invalid when |:bwipe| is
			used.  Using it anyway may crash Vim.

							*perl-Windows*
VIM::Windows([{wn}...])	With no arguments, returns a list of all the windows
			in an array context or returns the number of windows
			in a scalar context.  For a list of window numbers
			{wn}, returns a list of the windows with those
			numbers.
			WARNING: the list becomes invalid when a window is
			closed.  Using it anyway may crash Vim.

							*perl-DoCommand*
VIM::DoCommand({cmd})	Executes Ex command {cmd}.

							*perl-Eval*
VIM::Eval({expr})	Evaluates {expr} and returns (success, value) in list 
			context or just value in scalar context.
			success=1 indicates that val contains the value of
			{expr}; success=0 indicates a failure to evaluate
			the expression.  '@x' returns the contents of register
			x, '&x' returns the value of option x, 'x' returns the
			value of internal |variables| x, and '$x' is equivalent
			to perl's $ENV{x}.  All |functions| accessible from
			the command-line are valid for {expr}.
			A |List| is turned into a string by joining the items
			and inserting line breaks.

							*perl-SetHeight*
Window->SetHeight({height})
			Sets the Window height to {height}, within screen
			limits.

							*perl-GetCursor*
Window->Cursor({row}?, {col}?)
			With no arguments, returns a (row, col) array for the
			current cursor position in the Window.  With {row} and
			{col} arguments, sets the Window's cursor position to
			{row} and {col}.  Note that {col} is numbered from 0,
			Perl-fashion, and thus is one less than the value in
			Vim's ruler.

Window->Buffer()					*perl-Buffer*
			Returns the Buffer object corresponding to the given
			Window.

							*perl-Name*
Buffer->Name()		Returns the filename for the Buffer.

							*perl-Number*
Buffer->Number()	Returns the number of the Buffer.

							*perl-Count*
Buffer->Count()		Returns the number of lines in the Buffer.

							*perl-Get*
Buffer->Get({lnum}, {lnum}?, ...)
			Returns a text string of line {lnum} in the Buffer
			for each {lnum} specified.  An array can be passed
			with a list of {lnum}'s specified.

							*perl-Delete*
Buffer->Delete({lnum}, {lnum}?)
			Deletes line {lnum} in the Buffer.  With the second
			{lnum}, deletes the range of lines from the first
			{lnum} to the second {lnum}.

							*perl-Append*
Buffer->Append({lnum}, {line}, {line}?, ...)
			Appends each {line} string after Buffer line {lnum}.
			The list of {line}s can be an array.

							*perl-Set*
Buffer->Set({lnum}, {line}, {line}?, ...)
			Replaces one or more Buffer lines with specified
			{lines}s, starting at Buffer line {lnum}.  The list of
			{line}s can be an array.  If the arguments are
			invalid, replacement does not occur.

$main::curwin
			The current window object.

$main::curbuf
			The current buffer object.


							*script-here*
When using a script language in-line, you might want to skip this when the
language isn't supported.  But this mechanism doesn't work: >
   if has('perl')
     perl << EOF
       this will NOT work!
   EOF
   endif
Instead, put the Perl/Python/Ruby/etc. command in a function and call that
function: >
    if has('perl')
      function DefPerl()
	perl << EOF
	  this works
    EOF
      endfunction
      call DefPerl()
    endif
Note that "EOF" must be at the start of the line.

==============================================================================
4. Dynamic loading					*perl-dynamic*

On MS-Windows and Unix the Perl library can be loaded dynamically.  The
|:version| output then includes |+perl/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the Perl DLL or shared library file only
when needed.  When you don't use the Perl interface you don't need it, thus
you can use Vim without this file.


MS-Windows ~

You can download Perl from http://www.perl.org.  The one from ActiveState was
used for building Vim.

To use the Perl interface the Perl DLL must be in your search path.
If Vim reports it cannot find the perl512.dll, make sure your $PATH includes
the directory where it is located.  The Perl installer normally does that.
In a console window type "path" to see what directories are used.  The
'perldll' option can be also used to specify the Perl DLL.

The name of the DLL must match the Perl version Vim was compiled with.
Currently the name is "perl512.dll".  That is for Perl 5.12.  To know for
sure edit "gvim.exe" and search for "perl\d*.dll\c".


Unix ~

The 'perldll' option can be used to specify the Perl shared library file
instead of DYNAMIC_PERL_DLL file what was specified at compile time.  The
version of the shared library must match the Perl version Vim was compiled
with.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Paul Moore


The Python Interface to Vim				*python* *Python*

1. Commands					|python-commands|
2. The vim module				|python-vim|
3. Buffer objects				|python-buffer|
4. Range objects				|python-range|
5. Window objects				|python-window|
6. Tab page objects				|python-tabpage|
7. vim.bindeval objects				|python-bindeval-objects|
8. pyeval(), py3eval() Vim functions		|python-pyeval|
9. Dynamic loading				|python-dynamic|
10. Python 3					|python3|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

The Python 2.x interface is available only when Vim was compiled with the
|+python| feature.
The Python 3 interface is available only when Vim was compiled with the
|+python3| feature.
Both can be available at the same time, but read |python-2-and-3|.

==============================================================================
1. Commands						*python-commands*

					*:python* *:py* *E263* *E264* *E887*
:[range]py[thon] {stmt}
			Execute Python statement {stmt}.  A simple check if
			the `:python` command is working: >
				:python print "Hello"

:[range]py[thon] << {endmarker}
{script}
{endmarker}
			Execute Python script {script}.
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Python
			feature wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

{endmarker} must NOT be preceded by any white space.  If {endmarker} is
omitted from after the "<<", a dot '.' must be used after {script}, like
for the |:append| and |:insert| commands.
This form of the |:python| command is mainly useful for including python code
in Vim scripts.

Example: >
	function! IcecreamInitialize()
	python << EOF
	class StrawberryIcecream:
		def __call__(self):
			print 'EAT ME'
	EOF
	endfunction

To see what version of Python you have: >
	:python import sys
	:python print(sys.version)

Note: Python is very sensitive to the indenting.  Make sure the "class" line
and "EOF" do not have any indent.

							*:pydo*
:[range]pydo {body}	Execute Python function "def _vim_pydo(line, linenr):
			{body}" for each line in the [range], with the
			function arguments being set to the text of each line
			in turn, without a trailing <EOL>, and the current
			line number. The function should return a string or
			None. If a string is returned, it becomes the text of
			the line in the current turn. The default for [range]
			is the whole file: "1,$".
			{not in Vi}

Examples:
>
	:pydo return "%s\t%d" % (line[::-1], len(line))
	:pydo if line: return "%4d: %s" % (linenr, line)
<
							*:pyfile* *:pyf*
:[range]pyf[ile] {file}
			Execute the Python script in {file}.  The whole
			argument is used as a single file name.  {not in Vi}

Both of these commands do essentially the same thing - they execute a piece of
Python code, with the "current range" |python-range| set to the given line
range.

In the case of :python, the code to execute is in the command-line.
In the case of :pyfile, the code to execute is the contents of the given file.

Python commands cannot be used in the |sandbox|.

To pass arguments you need to set sys.argv[] explicitly.  Example: >

	:python import sys
	:python sys.argv = ["foo", "bar"]
	:pyfile myscript.py

Here are some examples					*python-examples*  >

	:python from vim import *
	:python from string import upper
	:python current.line = upper(current.line)
	:python print "Hello"
	:python str = current.buffer[42]

(Note that changes - like the imports - persist from one command to the next,
just like in the Python interpreter.)

==============================================================================
2. The vim module					*python-vim*

Python code gets all of its access to vim (with one exception - see
|python-output| below) via the "vim" module.  The vim module implements two
methods, three constants, and one error object.  You need to import the vim
module before using it: >
	:python import vim

Overview >
	:py print "Hello"		# displays a message
	:py vim.command(cmd)		# execute an Ex command
	:py w = vim.windows[n]		# gets window "n"
	:py cw = vim.current.window	# gets the current window
	:py b = vim.buffers[n]		# gets buffer "n"
	:py cb = vim.current.buffer	# gets the current buffer
	:py w.height = lines		# sets the window height
	:py w.cursor = (row, col)	# sets the window cursor position
	:py pos = w.cursor		# gets a tuple (row, col)
	:py name = b.name		# gets the buffer file name
	:py line = b[n]			# gets a line from the buffer
	:py lines = b[n:m]		# gets a list of lines
	:py num = len(b)		# gets the number of lines
	:py b[n] = str			# sets a line in the buffer
	:py b[n:m] = [str1, str2, str3]	# sets a number of lines at once
	:py del b[n]			# deletes a line
	:py del b[n:m]			# deletes a number of lines


Methods of the "vim" module

vim.command(str)					*python-command*
	Executes the vim (ex-mode) command str.  Returns None.
	Examples: >
	    :py vim.command("set tw=72")
	    :py vim.command("%s/aaa/bbb/g")
<	The following definition executes Normal mode commands: >
		def normal(str):
			vim.command("normal "+str)
		# Note the use of single quotes to delimit a string containing
		# double quotes
		normal('"a2dd"aP')
<								*E659*
	The ":python" command cannot be used recursively with Python 2.2 and
	older.  This only works with Python 2.3 and later: >
	    :py vim.command("python print 'Hello again Python'")

vim.eval(str)						*python-eval*
	Evaluates the expression str using the vim internal expression
	evaluator (see |expression|).  Returns the expression result as:
	- a string if the Vim expression evaluates to a string or number
	- a list if the Vim expression evaluates to a Vim list
	- a dictionary if the Vim expression evaluates to a Vim dictionary
	Dictionaries and lists are recursively expanded.
	Examples: >
	    :py text_width = vim.eval("&tw")
	    :py str = vim.eval("12+12")		# NB result is a string! Use
						# string.atoi() to convert to
						# a number.

	    :py tagList = vim.eval('taglist("eval_expr")')
<	The latter will return a python list of python dicts, for instance:
	[{'cmd': '/^eval_expr(arg, nextcmd)$/', 'static': 0, 'name':
	'eval_expr', 'kind': 'f', 'filename': './src/eval.c'}]

vim.bindeval(str)					*python-bindeval*
	Like |python-eval|, but returns special objects described in 
	|python-bindeval-objects|. These python objects let you modify (|List| 
	or |Dictionary|) or call (|Funcref|) vim objects.

vim.strwidth(str)					*python-strwidth*
	Like |strwidth()|: returns number of display cells str occupies, tab 
	is counted as one cell.

vim.foreach_rtp(callable)				*python-foreach_rtp*
	Call the given callable for each path in 'runtimepath' until either 
	callable returns something but None, the exception is raised or there 
	are no longer paths. If stopped in case callable returned non-None, 
	vim.foreach_rtp function returns the value returned by callable.

vim.chdir(*args, **kwargs)				*python-chdir*
vim.fchdir(*args, **kwargs)				*python-fchdir*
	Run os.chdir or os.fchdir, then all appropriate vim stuff.
	Note: you should not use these functions directly, use os.chdir and 
	      os.fchdir instead. Behavior of vim.fchdir is undefined in case 
	      os.fchdir does not exist.

Error object of the "vim" module

vim.error						*python-error*
	Upon encountering a Vim error, Python raises an exception of type
	vim.error.
	Example: >
		try:
			vim.command("put a")
		except vim.error:
			# nothing in register a

Constants of the "vim" module

	Note that these are not actually constants - you could reassign them.
	But this is silly, as you would then lose access to the vim objects
	to which the variables referred.

vim.buffers						*python-buffers*
	A mapping object providing access to the list of vim buffers.  The
	object supports the following operations: >
	    :py b = vim.buffers[i]	# Indexing (read-only)
	    :py b in vim.buffers	# Membership test
	    :py n = len(vim.buffers)	# Number of elements
	    :py for b in vim.buffers:	# Iterating over buffer list
<
vim.windows						*python-windows*
	A sequence object providing access to the list of vim windows.  The
	object supports the following operations: >
	    :py w = vim.windows[i]	# Indexing (read-only)
	    :py w in vim.windows	# Membership test
	    :py n = len(vim.windows)	# Number of elements
	    :py for w in vim.windows:	# Sequential access
<	Note: vim.windows object always accesses current tab page. 
	|python-tabpage|.windows objects are bound to parent |python-tabpage| 
	object and always use windows from that tab page (or throw vim.error 
	in case tab page was deleted). You can keep a reference to both 
	without keeping a reference to vim module object or |python-tabpage|, 
	they will not lose their properties in this case.

vim.tabpages						*python-tabpages*
	A sequence object providing access to the list of vim tab pages. The 
	object supports the following operations: >
	    :py t = vim.tabpages[i]	# Indexing (read-only)
	    :py t in vim.tabpages	# Membership test
	    :py n = len(vim.tabpages)	# Number of elements
	    :py for t in vim.tabpages:	# Sequential access
<
vim.current						*python-current*
	An object providing access (via specific attributes) to various
	"current" objects available in vim:
		vim.current.line	The current line (RW)		String
		vim.current.buffer	The current buffer (RW)		Buffer
		vim.current.window	The current window (RW)		Window
		vim.current.tabpage	The current tab page (RW)	TabPage
		vim.current.range	The current line range (RO)	Range

	The last case deserves a little explanation.  When the :python or
	:pyfile command specifies a range, this range of lines becomes the
	"current range".  A range is a bit like a buffer, but with all access
	restricted to a subset of lines.  See |python-range| for more details.

	Note: When assigning to vim.current.{buffer,window,tabpage} it expects 
	valid |python-buffer|, |python-window| or |python-tabpage| objects 
	respectively. Assigning triggers normal (with |autocommand|s) 
	switching to given buffer, window or tab page. It is the only way to 
	switch UI objects in python: you can't assign to 
	|python-tabpage|.window attribute. To switch without triggering 
	autocommands use >
	    py << EOF
	    saved_eventignore = vim.options['eventignore']
	    vim.options['eventignore'] = 'all'
	    try:
	        vim.current.buffer = vim.buffers[2] # Switch to buffer 2
	    finally:
	        vim.options['eventignore'] = saved_eventignore
	    EOF
<
vim.vars						*python-vars*
vim.vvars						*python-vvars*
	Dictionary-like objects holding dictionaries with global (|g:|) and 
	vim (|v:|) variables respectively. Identical to `vim.bindeval("g:")`, 
	but faster.

vim.options						*python-options*
	Object partly supporting mapping protocol (supports setting and 
	getting items) providing a read-write access to global options.
	Note: unlike |:set| this provides access only to global options. You
	cannot use this object to obtain or set local options' values or
	access local-only options in any fashion. Raises KeyError if no global
	option with such name exists (i.e. does not raise KeyError for
	|global-local| options and global only options, but does for window-
	and buffer-local ones).  Use |python-buffer| objects to access to
	buffer-local options and |python-window| objects to access to
	window-local options.

	Type of this object is available via "Options" attribute of vim 
	module.

Output from Python					*python-output*
	Vim displays all Python code output in the Vim message area.  Normal
	output appears as information messages, and error output appears as
	error messages.

	In implementation terms, this means that all output to sys.stdout
	(including the output from print statements) appears as information
	messages, and all output to sys.stderr (including error tracebacks)
	appears as error messages.

							*python-input*
	Input (via sys.stdin, including input() and raw_input()) is not
	supported, and may cause the program to crash.  This should probably be
	fixed.

		    *python2-directory* *python3-directory* *pythonx-directory*
Python 'runtimepath' handling				*python-special-path*

In python vim.VIM_SPECIAL_PATH special directory is used as a replacement for 
the list of paths found in 'runtimepath': with this directory in sys.path and 
vim.path_hooks in sys.path_hooks python will try to load module from 
{rtp}/python2 (or python3) and {rtp}/pythonx (for both python versions) for 
each {rtp} found in 'runtimepath'.

Implementation is similar to the following, but written in C: >

    from imp import find_module, load_module
    import vim
    import sys

    class VimModuleLoader(object):
        def __init__(self, module):
            self.module = module

        def load_module(self, fullname, path=None):
            return self.module

    def _find_module(fullname, oldtail, path):
        idx = oldtail.find('.')
        if idx > 0:
            name = oldtail[:idx]
            tail = oldtail[idx+1:]
            fmr = find_module(name, path)
            module = load_module(fullname[:-len(oldtail)] + name, *fmr)
            return _find_module(fullname, tail, module.__path__)
        else:
            fmr = find_module(fullname, path)
            return load_module(fullname, *fmr)

    # It uses vim module itself in place of VimPathFinder class: it does not 
    # matter for python which object has find_module function attached to as 
    # an attribute.
    class VimPathFinder(object):
        @classmethod
        def find_module(cls, fullname, path=None):
            try:
                return VimModuleLoader(_find_module(fullname, fullname, path or vim._get_paths()))
            except ImportError:
                return None

        @classmethod
        def load_module(cls, fullname, path=None):
            return _find_module(fullname, fullname, path or vim._get_paths())

    def hook(path):
        if path == vim.VIM_SPECIAL_PATH:
            return VimPathFinder
        else:
            raise ImportError

    sys.path_hooks.append(hook)

vim.VIM_SPECIAL_PATH					*python-VIM_SPECIAL_PATH*
	String constant used in conjunction with vim path hook. If path hook 
	installed by vim is requested to handle anything but path equal to 
	vim.VIM_SPECIAL_PATH constant it raises ImportError. In the only other 
	case it uses special loader.

	Note: you must not use value of this constant directly, always use 
	      vim.VIM_SPECIAL_PATH object.

vim.find_module(...)					*python-find_module*
vim.path_hook(path)					*python-path_hook*
	Methods or objects used to implement path loading as described above. 
	You should not be using any of these directly except for vim.path_hook 
	in case you need to do something with sys.meta_path. It is not 
	guaranteed that any of the objects will exist in the future vim 
	versions.

vim._get_paths						*python-_get_paths*
	Methods returning a list of paths which will be searched for by path 
	hook. You should not rely on this method being present in future 
	versions, but can use it for debugging.

	It returns a list of {rtp}/python2 (or {rtp}/python3) and 
	{rtp}/pythonx directories for each {rtp} in 'runtimepath'.

==============================================================================
3. Buffer objects					*python-buffer*

Buffer objects represent vim buffers.  You can obtain them in a number of ways:
	- via vim.current.buffer (|python-current|)
	- from indexing vim.buffers (|python-buffers|)
	- from the "buffer" attribute of a window (|python-window|)

Buffer objects have two read-only attributes - name - the full file name for
the buffer, and number - the buffer number.  They also have three methods
(append, mark, and range; see below).

You can also treat buffer objects as sequence objects.  In this context, they
act as if they were lists (yes, they are mutable) of strings, with each
element being a line of the buffer.  All of the usual sequence operations,
including indexing, index assignment, slicing and slice assignment, work as
you would expect.  Note that the result of indexing (slicing) a buffer is a
string (list of strings).  This has one unusual consequence - b[:] is different
from b.  In particular, "b[:] = None" deletes the whole of the buffer, whereas
"b = None" merely updates the variable b, with no effect on the buffer.

Buffer indexes start at zero, as is normal in Python.  This differs from vim
line numbers, which start from 1.  This is particularly relevant when dealing
with marks (see below) which use vim line numbers.

The buffer object attributes are:
	b.vars		Dictionary-like object used to access 
			|buffer-variable|s.
	b.options	Mapping object (supports item getting, setting and 
			deleting) that provides access to buffer-local options 
			and buffer-local values of |global-local| options. Use 
			|python-window|.options if option is window-local, 
			this object will raise KeyError. If option is 
			|global-local| and local value is missing getting it 
			will return None.
	b.name		String, RW. Contains buffer name (full path).
			Note: when assigning to b.name |BufFilePre| and 
			|BufFilePost| autocommands are launched.
	b.number	Buffer number. Can be used as |python-buffers| key.
			Read-only.
	b.valid		True or False. Buffer object becomes invalid when 
			corresponding buffer is wiped out.

The buffer object methods are:
	b.append(str)	Append a line to the buffer
	b.append(str, nr)  Idem, below line "nr"
	b.append(list)	Append a list of lines to the buffer
			Note that the option of supplying a list of strings to
			the append method differs from the equivalent method
			for Python's built-in list objects.
	b.append(list, nr)  Idem, below line "nr"
	b.mark(name)	Return a tuple (row,col) representing the position
			of the named mark (can also get the []"<> marks)
	b.range(s,e)	Return a range object (see |python-range|) which
			represents the part of the given buffer between line
			numbers s and e |inclusive|.

Note that when adding a line it must not contain a line break character '\n'.
A trailing '\n' is allowed and ignored, so that you can do: >
	:py b.append(f.readlines())

Buffer object type is available using "Buffer" attribute of vim module.

Examples (assume b is the current buffer) >
	:py print b.name		# write the buffer file name
	:py b[0] = "hello!!!"		# replace the top line
	:py b[:] = None			# delete the whole buffer
	:py del b[:]			# delete the whole buffer
	:py b[0:0] = [ "a line" ]	# add a line at the top
	:py del b[2]			# delete a line (the third)
	:py b.append("bottom")		# add a line at the bottom
	:py n = len(b)			# number of lines
	:py (row,col) = b.mark('a')	# named mark
	:py r = b.range(1,5)		# a sub-range of the buffer
	:py b.vars["foo"] = "bar"	# assign b:foo variable
	:py b.options["ff"] = "dos"	# set fileformat
	:py del b.options["ar"]		# same as :set autoread<

==============================================================================
4. Range objects					*python-range*

Range objects represent a part of a vim buffer.  You can obtain them in a
number of ways:
	- via vim.current.range (|python-current|)
	- from a buffer's range() method (|python-buffer|)

A range object is almost identical in operation to a buffer object.  However,
all operations are restricted to the lines within the range (this line range
can, of course, change as a result of slice assignments, line deletions, or
the range.append() method).

The range object attributes are:
	r.start		Index of first line into the buffer
	r.end		Index of last line into the buffer

The range object methods are:
	r.append(str)	Append a line to the range
	r.append(str, nr)  Idem, after line "nr"
	r.append(list)	Append a list of lines to the range
			Note that the option of supplying a list of strings to
			the append method differs from the equivalent method
			for Python's built-in list objects.
	r.append(list, nr)  Idem, after line "nr"

Range object type is available using "Range" attribute of vim module.

Example (assume r is the current range):
	# Send all lines in a range to the default printer
	vim.command("%d,%dhardcopy!" % (r.start+1,r.end+1))

==============================================================================
5. Window objects					*python-window*

Window objects represent vim windows.  You can obtain them in a number of ways:
	- via vim.current.window (|python-current|)
	- from indexing vim.windows (|python-windows|)
	- from indexing "windows" attribute of a tab page (|python-tabpage|)
	- from the "window" attribute of a tab page (|python-tabpage|)

You can manipulate window objects only through their attributes.  They have no
methods, and no sequence or other interface.

Window attributes are:
	buffer (read-only)	The buffer displayed in this window
	cursor (read-write)	The current cursor position in the window
				This is a tuple, (row,col).
	height (read-write)	The window height, in rows
	width (read-write)	The window width, in columns
	vars (read-only)	The window |w:| variables. Attribute is 
				unassignable, but you can change window 
				variables this way
	options (read-only)	The window-local options. Attribute is 
				unassignable, but you can change window 
				options this way. Provides access only to 
				window-local options, for buffer-local use 
				|python-buffer| and for global ones use 
				|python-options|. If option is |global-local| 
				and local value is missing getting it will 
				return None.
	number (read-only)	Window number.  The first window has number 1.
				This is zero in case it cannot be determined
				(e.g. when the window object belongs to other
				tab page).
	row, col (read-only)	On-screen window position in display cells.
				First position is zero.
	tabpage (read-only)	Window tab page.
	valid (read-write)	True or False. Window object becomes invalid 
				when corresponding window is closed.

The height attribute is writable only if the screen is split horizontally.
The width attribute is writable only if the screen is split vertically.

Window object type is available using "Window" attribute of vim module.

==============================================================================
6. Tab page objects					*python-tabpage*

Tab page objects represent vim tab pages. You can obtain them in a number of 
ways:
	- via vim.current.tabpage (|python-current|)
	- from indexing vim.tabpages (|python-tabpages|)

You can use this object to access tab page windows. They have no methods and 
no sequence or other interfaces.

Tab page attributes are:
	number		The tab page number like the one returned by 
			|tabpagenr()|.
	windows		Like |python-windows|, but for current tab page.
	vars		The tab page |t:| variables.
	window		Current tabpage window.
	valid		True or False. Tab page object becomes invalid when 
			corresponding tab page is closed.

TabPage object type is available using "TabPage" attribute of vim module.

7. vim.bindeval objects				*python-bindeval-objects*

vim.Dictionary object				*python-Dictionary*
    Dictionary-like object providing access to vim |Dictionary| type.
    Attributes:
        Attribute  Description ~
        locked     One of                       *python-.locked*
                    Value           Description ~
                    zero            Variable is not locked
                    vim.VAR_LOCKED  Variable is locked, but can be unlocked
                    vim.VAR_FIXED   Variable is locked and can't be unlocked
                   Read-write. You can unlock locked variable by assigning 
                   `True` or `False` to this attribute. No recursive locking 
                   is supported.
        scope      One of
                    Value              Description ~
                    zero               Dictionary is not a scope one
                    vim.VAR_DEF_SCOPE  |g:| or |l:| dictionary
                    vim.VAR_SCOPE      Other scope dictionary,
                                       see |internal-variables|
    Methods (note: methods do not support keyword arguments):
        Method      Description ~
        keys()      Returns a list with dictionary keys.
        values()    Returns a list with dictionary values.
        items()     Returns a list of 2-tuples with dictionary contents.
        update(iterable), update(dictionary), update(**kwargs)
                    Adds keys to dictionary.
        get(key[, default=None])
                    Obtain key from dictionary, returning the default if it is 
                    not present.
        pop(key[, default])
                    Remove specified key from dictionary and return 
                    corresponding value. If key is not found and default is 
                    given returns the default, otherwise raises KeyError.
        popitem()
                    Remove random key from dictionary and return (key, value) 
                    pair.
        has_key(key)
                    Check whether dictionary contains specified key, similar 
                    to `key in dict`.

        __new__(), __new__(iterable), __new__(dictionary), __new__(update)
                    You can use `vim.Dictionary()` to create new vim 
                    dictionaries. `d=vim.Dictionary(arg)` is the same as 
                    `d=vim.bindeval('{}');d.update(arg)`. Without arguments 
                    constructs empty dictionary.

    Examples: >
        d = vim.Dictionary(food="bar")		# Constructor
        d['a'] = 'b'				# Item assignment
        print d['a']				# getting item
        d.update({'c': 'd'})			# .update(dictionary)
        d.update(e='f')				# .update(**kwargs)
        d.update((('g', 'h'), ('i', 'j')))	# .update(iterable)
        for key in d.keys():			# .keys()
        for val in d.values():			# .values()
        for key, val in d.items():		# .items()
        print isinstance(d, vim.Dictionary)	# True
        for key in d:				# Iteration over keys
        class Dict(vim.Dictionary):		# Subclassing
<
    Note: when iterating over keys you should not modify dictionary.

vim.List object					*python-List*
    Sequence-like object providing access to vim |List| type.
    Supports `.locked` attribute, see |python-.locked|. Also supports the 
    following methods:
        Method          Description ~
        extend(item)    Add items to the list.

        __new__(), __new__(iterable)
                        You can use `vim.List()` to create new vim lists. 
                        `l=vim.List(iterable)` is the same as 
                        `l=vim.bindeval('[]');l.extend(iterable)`. Without 
                        arguments constructs empty list.
    Examples: >
        l = vim.List("abc")		# Constructor, result: ['a', 'b', 'c']
        l.extend(['abc', 'def'])	# .extend() method
        print l[1:]			# slicing
        l[:0] = ['ghi', 'jkl']		# slice assignment
        print l[0]			# getting item
        l[0] = 'mno'			# assignment
        for i in l:			# iteration
        print isinstance(l, vim.List)	# True
        class List(vim.List):		# Subclassing

vim.Function object				*python-Function*
    Function-like object, acting like vim |Funcref| object. Accepts special 
    keyword argument `self`, see |Dictionary-function|. You can also use 
    `vim.Function(name)` constructor, it is the same as 
    `vim.bindeval('function(%s)'%json.dumps(name))`.

    Attributes (read-only):
        Attribute    Description ~
        name         Function name.
        args         `None` or a |python-List| object with arguments.  Note 
                     that this is a copy of the arguments list, constructed 
                     each time you request this attribute. Modifications made 
                     to the list will be ignored (but not to the containers 
                     inside argument list: this is like |copy()| and not 
                     |deepcopy()|).
        self         `None` or a |python-Dictionary| object with self 
                     dictionary. Note that explicit `self` keyword used when 
                     calling resulting object overrides this attribute.
        auto_rebind  Boolean. True if partial created from this Python object 
                     and stored in the VimL dictionary should be automatically 
                     rebound to the dictionary it is stored in when this 
                     dictionary is indexed. Exposes Vim internal difference 
                     between `dict.func` (auto_rebind=True) and 
                     `function(dict.func,dict)` (auto_rebind=False). This 
                     attribute makes no sense if `self` attribute is `None`.

    Constructor additionally accepts `args`, `self` and `auto_rebind` 
    keywords.  If `args` and/or `self` argument is given then it constructs 
    a partial, see |function()|.  `auto_rebind` is only used when `self` 
    argument is given, otherwise it is assumed to be `True` regardless of 
    whether it was given or not.  If `self` is given then it defaults to 
    `False`.

    Examples: >
        f = vim.Function('tr')			# Constructor
        print f('abc', 'a', 'b')		# Calls tr('abc', 'a', 'b')
        vim.command('''
            function DictFun() dict
                return self
            endfunction
        ''')
        f = vim.bindeval('function("DictFun")')
        print f(self={})			# Like call('DictFun', [], {})
        print isinstance(f, vim.Function)	# True

        p = vim.Function('DictFun', self={})
        print f()
        p = vim.Function('tr', args=['abc', 'a'])
        print f('b')

==============================================================================
8. pyeval() and py3eval() Vim functions			*python-pyeval*

To facilitate bi-directional interface, you can use |pyeval()| and |py3eval()| 
functions to evaluate Python expressions and pass their values to VimL.

==============================================================================
9. Dynamic loading					*python-dynamic*

On MS-Windows and Unix the Python library can be loaded dynamically.  The
|:version| output then includes |+python/dyn| or |+python3/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the Python DLL or shared library file only
when needed.  When you don't use the Python interface you don't need it, thus
you can use Vim without this file.


MS-Windows ~

To use the Python interface the Python DLL must be in your search path.  In a
console window type "path" to see what directories are used.  The 'pythondll'
or 'pythonthreedll' option can be also used to specify the Python DLL.

The name of the DLL must match the Python version Vim was compiled with.
Currently the name is "python24.dll".  That is for Python 2.4.  To know for
sure edit "gvim.exe" and search for "python\d*.dll\c".


Unix ~

The 'pythondll' or 'pythonthreedll' option can be used to specify the Python
shared library file instead of DYNAMIC_PYTHON_DLL or DYNAMIC_PYTHON3_DLL file
what were specified at compile time.  The version of the shared library must
match the Python 2.x or Python 3 version Vim was compiled with.

==============================================================================
10. Python 3						*python3*

							*:py3* *:python3*
The `:py3` and `:python3` commands work similar to `:python`.  A simple check
if the `:py3` command is working: >
	:py3 print("Hello")

To see what version of Python you have: >
	:py3 import sys
	:py3 print(sys.version)
<							*:py3file*
The `:py3file` command works similar to `:pyfile`.
							*:py3do*
The `:py3do` command works similar to `:pydo`.


Vim can be built in four ways (:version output):
1. No Python support	    (-python, -python3)
2. Python 2 support only    (+python or +python/dyn, -python3)
3. Python 3 support only    (-python, +python3 or +python3/dyn)
4. Python 2 and 3 support   (+python/dyn, +python3/dyn)

Some more details on the special case 4:  *python-2-and-3*

When Python 2 and Python 3 are both supported they must be loaded dynamically.

When doing this on Linux/Unix systems and importing global symbols, this leads
to a crash when the second Python version is used.  So either global symbols
are loaded but only one Python version is activated, or no global symbols are
loaded. The latter makes Python's "import" fail on libraries that expect the
symbols to be provided by Vim.
							*E836* *E837*
Vim's configuration script makes a guess for all libraries based on one
standard Python library (termios).  If importing this library succeeds for
both Python versions, then both will be made available in Vim at the same
time.  If not, only the version first used in a session will be enabled.
When trying to use the other one you will get the E836 or E837 error message.

Here Vim's behavior depends on the system in which it was configured.  In a
system where both versions of Python were configured with --enable-shared,
both versions of Python will be activated at the same time.  There will still
be problems with other third party libraries that were not linked to
libPython.

To work around such problems there are these options:
1. The problematic library is recompiled to link to the according
   libpython.so.
2. Vim is recompiled for only one Python version.
3. You undefine PY_NO_RTLD_GLOBAL in auto/config.h after configuration.  This
   may crash Vim though.

							*E880*
Raising SystemExit exception in python isn't endorsed way to quit vim, use: >
	:py vim.command("qall!")
<

							*has-python*
You can test what Python version is available with: >
	if has('python')
	  echo 'there is Python 2.x'
  	elseif has('python3')
	  echo 'there is Python 3.x'
	endif

Note however, that when Python 2 and 3 are both available and loaded
dynamically, these has() calls will try to load them.  If only one can be
loaded at a time, just checking if Python 2 or 3 are available will prevent
the other one from being available.

The Ruby Interface to Vim				*ruby* *Ruby*


1. Commands			|ruby-commands|
2. The Vim module		|ruby-vim|
3. Vim::Buffer objects		|ruby-buffer|
4. Vim::Window objects		|ruby-window|
5. Global variables		|ruby-globals|
6. Dynamic loading		|ruby-dynamic|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}
			*E266* *E267* *E268* *E269* *E270* *E271* *E272* *E273*

The Ruby interface only works when Vim was compiled with the |+ruby| feature.

The home page for ruby is http://www.ruby-lang.org/.  You can find links for
downloading Ruby there.

==============================================================================
1. Commands						*ruby-commands*

							*:ruby* *:rub*
:rub[y] {cmd}		Execute Ruby command {cmd}.  A command to try it out: >
				:ruby print "Hello"

:rub[y] << {endpattern}
{script}
{endpattern}
			Execute Ruby script {script}.
			{endpattern} must NOT be preceded by any white space.
			If {endpattern} is omitted, it defaults to a dot '.'
			like for the |:append| and |:insert| commands.  This
			form of the |:ruby| command is mainly useful for
			including ruby code in vim scripts.
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Ruby feature
			wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

Example Vim script: >

	function! RedGem()
	ruby << EOF
	class Garnet
		def initialize(s)
			@buffer = Vim::Buffer.current
			vimputs(s)
		end
		def vimputs(s)
			@buffer.append(@buffer.count,s)
		end
	end
	gem = Garnet.new("pretty")
	EOF
	endfunction
<
To see what version of Ruby you have: >
	:ruby print RUBY_VERSION
<

						*:rubydo* *:rubyd* *E265*
:[range]rubyd[o] {cmd}	Evaluate Ruby command {cmd} for each line in the
			[range], with $_ being set to the text of each line in
			turn, without a trailing <EOL>.  Setting $_ will change
			the text, but note that it is not possible to add or
			delete lines using this command.
			The default for [range] is the whole file: "1,$".

							*:rubyfile* *:rubyf*
:rubyf[ile] {file}	Execute the Ruby script in {file}.  This is the same as
			":ruby load 'file'", but allows file name completion.

Executing Ruby commands is not possible in the |sandbox|.

==============================================================================
2. The Vim module					*ruby-vim*

Ruby code gets all of its access to vim via the "Vim" module.

Overview: >
	print "Hello"			      # displays a message
	Vim.command(cmd)		      # execute an Ex command
	num = Vim::Window.count		      # gets the number of windows
	w = Vim::Window[n]		      # gets window "n"
	cw = Vim::Window.current	      # gets the current window
	num = Vim::Buffer.count		      # gets the number of buffers
	b = Vim::Buffer[n]		      # gets buffer "n"
	cb = Vim::Buffer.current	      # gets the current buffer
	w.height = lines		      # sets the window height
	w.cursor = [row, col]		      # sets the window cursor position
	pos = w.cursor			      # gets an array [row, col]
	name = b.name			      # gets the buffer file name
	line = b[n]			      # gets a line from the buffer
	num = b.count			      # gets the number of lines
	b[n] = str			      # sets a line in the buffer
	b.delete(n)			      # deletes a line
	b.append(n, str)		      # appends a line after n
	line = Vim::Buffer.current.line       # gets the current line
	num = Vim::Buffer.current.line_number # gets the current line number
	Vim::Buffer.current.line = "test"     # sets the current line number
<

Module Functions:

							*ruby-message*
Vim::message({msg})
	Displays the message {msg}.

							*ruby-set_option*
Vim::set_option({arg})
	Sets a vim option.  {arg} can be any argument that the ":set" command
	accepts.  Note that this means that no spaces are allowed in the
	argument!  See |:set|.

							*ruby-command*
Vim::command({cmd})
	Executes Ex command {cmd}.

							*ruby-evaluate*
Vim::evaluate({expr})
	Evaluates {expr} using the vim internal expression evaluator (see
	|expression|).  Returns the expression result as:
	- a Integer if the Vim expression evaluates to a number
	- a Float if the Vim expression evaluates to a float
	- a String if the Vim expression evaluates to a string
	- a Array if the Vim expression evaluates to a Vim list
	- a Hash if the Vim expression evaluates to a Vim dictionary
	Dictionaries and lists are recursively expanded.

==============================================================================
3. Vim::Buffer objects					*ruby-buffer*

Vim::Buffer objects represent vim buffers.

Class Methods:

current		Returns the current buffer object.
count		Returns the number of buffers.
self[{n}]	Returns the buffer object for the number {n}.  The first number
		is 0.

Methods:

name		Returns the name of the buffer.
number		Returns the number of the buffer.
count		Returns the number of lines.
length		Returns the number of lines.
self[{n}]	Returns a line from the buffer. {n} is the line number.
self[{n}] = {str}
		Sets a line in the buffer. {n} is the line number.
delete({n})	Deletes a line from the buffer. {n} is the line number.
append({n}, {str})
		Appends a line after the line {n}.
line		Returns the current line of the buffer if the buffer is
		active.
line = {str}    Sets the current line of the buffer if the buffer is active.
line_number     Returns the number of the current line if the buffer is
		active.

==============================================================================
4. Vim::Window objects					*ruby-window*

Vim::Window objects represent vim windows.

Class Methods:

current		Returns the current window object.
count		Returns the number of windows.
self[{n}]	Returns the window object for the number {n}.  The first number
		is 0.

Methods:

buffer		Returns the buffer displayed in the window.
height		Returns the height of the window.
height = {n}	Sets the window height to {n}.
width		Returns the width of the window.
width = {n}	Sets the window width to {n}.
cursor		Returns a [row, col] array for the cursor position.
cursor = [{row}, {col}]
		Sets the cursor position to {row} and {col}.

==============================================================================
5. Global variables					*ruby-globals*

There are two global variables.

$curwin		The current window object.
$curbuf		The current buffer object.

==============================================================================
6. Dynamic loading					*ruby-dynamic*

On MS-Windows and Unix the Ruby library can be loaded dynamically.  The
|:version| output then includes |+ruby/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the Ruby DLL file or shared library only
when needed.  When you don't use the Ruby interface you don't need it, thus
you can use Vim even though this library file is not on your system.


MS-Windows ~

You need to install the right version of Ruby for this to work.  You can find
the package to download from:
http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
Currently that is rubyinstaller-2.2.5.exe

To use the Ruby interface the Ruby DLL must be in your search path.  In a
console window type "path" to see what directories are used.  The 'rubydll'
option can be also used to specify the Ruby DLL.

The name of the DLL must match the Ruby version Vim was compiled with.
Currently the name is "msvcrt-ruby220.dll".  That is for Ruby 2.2.X.  To know
for sure edit "gvim.exe" and search for "ruby\d*.dll\c".

If you want to build Vim with RubyInstaller 1.9 or 2.X using MSVC, you need
some tricks.  See the src/INSTALLpc.txt for detail.


Unix ~

The 'rubydll' option can be used to specify the Ruby shared library file
instead of DYNAMIC_RUBY_DLL file what was specified at compile time.  The
version of the shared library must match the Ruby version Vim was compiled
with.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Ingo Wilken


The Tcl Interface to Vim				*tcl* *Tcl* *TCL*

1. Commands				|tcl-ex-commands|
2. Tcl commands				|tcl-commands|
3. Tcl variables			|tcl-variables|
4. Tcl window commands			|tcl-window-cmds|
5. Tcl buffer commands			|tcl-buffer-cmds|
6. Miscellaneous; Output from Tcl	|tcl-misc| |tcl-output|
7. Known bugs & problems		|tcl-bugs|
8. Examples				|tcl-examples|
9. Dynamic loading			|tcl-dynamic|

{Vi does not have any of these commands} *E280*

The Tcl interface only works when Vim was compiled with the |+tcl| feature.

WARNING: There are probably still some bugs.  Please send bug reports,
comments, ideas etc to <Ingo.Wilken@informatik.uni-oldenburg.de>

==============================================================================
1. Commands				*tcl-ex-commands* *E571* *E572*

							*:tcl* *:tc*
:tc[l] {cmd}		Execute Tcl command {cmd}.  A simple check if `:tcl`
			is working: >
				:tcl puts "Hello"

:[range]tc[l] << {endmarker}
{script}
{endmarker}
			Execute Tcl script {script}.
			Note: This command doesn't work when the Tcl feature
			wasn't compiled in.  To avoid errors, see
			|script-here|.

{endmarker} must NOT be preceded by any white space.  If {endmarker} is
omitted from after the "<<", a dot '.' must be used after {script}, like for
the |:append| and |:insert| commands.
This form of the |:tcl| command is mainly useful for including tcl code in Vim
scripts.

Example: >
	function! DefineDate()
	    tcl << EOF
	    proc date {} {
		return [clock format [clock seconds]]
	    }
	EOF
	endfunction
<
To see what version of Tcl you have: >
	:tcl puts [info patchlevel]
<

							*:tcldo* *:tcld*
:[range]tcld[o] {cmd}	Execute Tcl command {cmd} for each line in [range]
			with the variable "line" being set to the text of each
			line in turn, and "lnum" to the line number.  Setting
			"line" will change the text, but note that it is not
			possible to add or delete lines using this command.
			If {cmd} returns an error, the command is interrupted.
			The default for [range] is the whole file: "1,$".
			See |tcl-var-line| and |tcl-var-lnum|.  {not in Vi}

							*:tclfile* *:tclf*
:tclf[ile] {file}	Execute the Tcl script in {file}.  This is the same as
			":tcl source {file}", but allows file name completion.
			{not in Vi}


Note that Tcl objects (like variables) persist from one command to the next,
just as in the Tcl shell.

Executing Tcl commands is not possible in the |sandbox|.

==============================================================================
2. Tcl commands						*tcl-commands*

Tcl code gets all of its access to vim via commands in the "::vim" namespace.
The following commands are implemented: >

	::vim::beep			# Guess.
	::vim::buffer {n}		# Create Tcl command for one buffer.
	::vim::buffer list		# Create Tcl commands for all buffers.
	::vim::command [-quiet] {cmd}	# Execute an Ex command.
	::vim::expr {expr}		# Use Vim's expression evaluator.
	::vim::option {opt}		# Get vim option.
	::vim::option {opt} {val}	# Set vim option.
	::vim::window list		# Create Tcl commands for all windows.

Commands:
	::vim::beep					*tcl-beep*
	Honk.  Does not return a result.

	::vim::buffer {n}				*tcl-buffer*
	::vim::buffer exists {n}
	::vim::buffer list
	Provides access to vim buffers.  With an integer argument, creates a
	buffer command (see |tcl-buffer-cmds|) for the buffer with that
	number, and returns its name as the result.  Invalid buffer numbers
	result in a standard Tcl error.  To test for valid buffer numbers,
	vim's internal functions can be used: >
		set nbufs [::vim::expr bufnr("$")]
		set isvalid [::vim::expr "bufexists($n)"]
<	The "list" option creates a buffer command for each valid buffer, and
	returns a list of the command names as the result.
	Example: >
		set bufs [::vim::buffer list]
		foreach b $bufs { $b append end "The End!" }
<	The "exists" option checks if a buffer with the given number exists.
	Example: >
		if { [::vim::buffer exists $n] } { ::vim::command ":e #$n" }
<	This command might be replaced by a variable in future versions.
	See also |tcl-var-current| for the current buffer.

	::vim::command {cmd}				*tcl-command*
	::vim::command -quiet {cmd}
	Execute the vim (ex-mode) command {cmd}.  Any Ex command that affects
	a buffer or window uses the current buffer/current window.  Does not
	return a result other than a standard Tcl error code.  After this
	command is completed, the "::vim::current" variable is updated.
	The "-quiet" flag suppresses any error messages from vim.
	Examples: >
		::vim::command "set ts=8"
		::vim::command "%s/foo/bar/g"
<	To execute normal-mode commands, use "normal" (see |:normal|): >
		set cmd "jj"
		::vim::command "normal $cmd"
<	See also |tcl-window-command| and |tcl-buffer-command|.

	::vim::expr {expr}				*tcl-expr*
	Evaluates the expression {expr} using vim's internal expression
	evaluator (see |expression|).   Any expression that queries a buffer
	or window property uses the current buffer/current window.  Returns
	the result as a string.  A |List| is turned into a string by joining
	the items and inserting line breaks.
	Examples: >
		set perl_available [::vim::expr has("perl")]
<	See also |tcl-window-expr| and |tcl-buffer-expr|.

	::vim::option {opt}				*tcl-option*
	::vim::option {opt} {value}
	Without second argument, queries the value of a vim option.  With this
	argument, sets the vim option to {value}, and returns the previous
	value as the result.  Any options that are marked as 'local to buffer'
	or 'local to window' affect the current buffer/current window.  The
	global value is not changed, use the ":set" command for that.  For
	boolean options, {value} should be "0" or "1", or any of the keywords
	"on", "off" or "toggle".  See |option-summary| for a list of options.
	Example: >
		::vim::option ts 8
<	See also |tcl-window-option| and |tcl-buffer-option|.

	::vim::window {option}				*tcl-window*
	Provides access to vim windows.  Currently only the "list" option is
	implemented.  This creates a window command (see |tcl-window-cmds|) for
	each window, and returns a list of the command names as the result.
	Example: >
		set wins [::vim::window list]
		foreach w $wins { $w height 4 }
<	This command might be replaced by a variable in future versions.
	See also |tcl-var-current| for the current window.

==============================================================================
3. Tcl variables					*tcl-variables*

The ::vim namespace contains a few variables.  These are created when the Tcl
interpreter is called from vim and set to current values. >

	::vim::current		# array containing "current" objects
	::vim::lbase		# number of first line
	::vim::range		# array containing current range numbers
	line			# current line as a string (:tcldo only)
	lnum			# current line number (:tcldo only)

Variables:
	::vim::current					*tcl-var-current*
	This is an array providing access to various "current" objects
	available in vim.  The contents of this array are updated after
	"::vim::command" is called, as this might change vim's current
	settings (e.g., by deleting the current buffer).
	The "buffer" element contains the name of the buffer command for the
	current buffer.  This can be used directly to invoke buffer commands
	(see |tcl-buffer-cmds|).  This element is read-only.
	Example: >
		$::vim::current(buffer) insert begin "Hello world"
<	The "window" element contains the name of the window command for the
	current window.  This can be used directly to invoke window commands
	(see |tcl-window-cmds|).  This element is read-only.
	Example: >
		$::vim::current(window) height 10
<
	::vim::lbase					*tcl-var-lbase*
	This variable controls how Tcl treats line numbers.  If it is set to
	'1', then lines and columns start at 1.  This way, line numbers from
	Tcl commands and vim expressions are compatible.  If this variable is
	set to '0', then line numbers and columns start at 0 in Tcl.  This is
	useful if you want to treat a buffer as a Tcl list or a line as a Tcl
	string and use standard Tcl commands that return an index ("lsort" or
	"string first", for example).  The default value is '1'.  Currently,
	any non-zero values is treated as '1', but your scripts should not
	rely on this.  See also |tcl-linenumbers|.

	::vim::range					*tcl-var-range*
	This is an array with three elements, "start", "begin" and "end".  It
	contains the line numbers of the start and end row of the current
	range.  "begin" is the same as "start".  This variable is read-only.
	See |tcl-examples|.

	line						*tcl-var-line*
	lnum						*tcl-var-lnum*
	These global variables are only available if the ":tcldo" Ex command
	is being executed.  They contain the text and line number of the
	current line.  When the Tcl command invoked by ":tcldo" is completed,
	the current line is set to the contents of the "line" variable, unless
	the variable was unset by the Tcl command.  The "lnum" variable is
	read-only.  These variables are not in the "::vim" namespace so they
	can be used in ":tcldo" without much typing (this might be changed in
	future versions).  See also |tcl-linenumbers|.

==============================================================================
4. Tcl window commands					*tcl-window-cmds*

Window commands represent vim windows.  They are created by several commands:
	::vim::window list			|tcl-window|
	"windows" option of a buffer command	|tcl-buffer-windows|
The ::vim::current(window) variable contains the name of the window command
for the current window.  A window command is automatically deleted when the
corresponding vim window is closed.

Let's assume the name of the window command is stored in the Tcl variable "win",
i.e. "$win" calls the command.  The following options are available: >

	$win buffer		# Create Tcl command for window's buffer.
	$win command {cmd}	# Execute Ex command in windows context.
	$win cursor		# Get current cursor position.
	$win cursor {var}	# Set cursor position from array variable.
	$win cursor {row} {col}	# Set cursor position.
	$win delcmd {cmd}	# Call Tcl command when window is closed.
	$win expr {expr}	# Evaluate vim expression in windows context.
	$win height		# Report the window's height.
	$win height {n}		# Set the window's height.
	$win option {opt} [val]	# Get/Set vim option in windows context.

Options:
	$win buffer					*tcl-window-buffer*
	Creates a Tcl command for the window's buffer, and returns its name as
	the result.  The name should be stored in a variable: >
		set buf [$win buffer]
<	$buf is now a valid Tcl command.  See |tcl-buffer-cmds| for the
	available options.

	$win cursor					*tcl-window-cursor*
	$win cursor {var}
	$win cursor {row} {col}
	Without argument, reports the current cursor position as a string.
	This can be converted to a Tcl array variable: >
		array set here [$win cursor]
<	"here(row)" and "here(column)" now contain the cursor position.
	With a single argument, the argument is interpreted as the name of a
	Tcl array variable, which must contain two elements "row" and "column".
	These are used to set the cursor to the new position: >
		$win cursor here	;# not $here !
<	With two arguments, sets the cursor to the specified row and column: >
		$win cursor $here(row) $here(column)
<	Invalid positions result in a standard Tcl error, which can be caught
	with "catch".  The row and column values depend on the "::vim::lbase"
	variable.  See |tcl-var-lbase|.

	$win delcmd {cmd}				*tcl-window-delcmd*
	Registers the Tcl command {cmd} as a deletion callback for the window.
	This command is executed (in the global scope) just before the window
	is closed.  Complex commands should be build with "list": >
		$win delcmd [list puts vimerr "window deleted"]
<	See also |tcl-buffer-delcmd|.

	$win height					*tcl-window-height*
	$win height {n}
	Without argument, reports the window's current height.  With an
	argument, tries to set the window's height to {n}, then reports the
	new height (which might be different from {n}).

	$win command [-quiet] {cmd}			*tcl-window-command*
	$win expr {expr}				*tcl-window-expr*
	$win option {opt} [val]				*tcl-window-option*
	These are similar to "::vim::command" etc., except that everything is
	done in the context of the window represented by $win, instead of the
	current window.  For example, setting an option that is marked 'local
	to window' affects the window $win.  Anything that affects or queries
	a buffer uses the buffer displayed in this window (i.e. the buffer
	that is represented by "$win buffer").  See |tcl-command|, |tcl-expr|
	and |tcl-option| for more information.
	Example: >
		$win option number on

==============================================================================
5. Tcl buffer commands					*tcl-buffer-cmds*

Buffer commands represent vim buffers.  They are created by several commands:
	::vim::buffer {N}			|tcl-buffer|
	::vim::buffer list			|tcl-buffer|
	"buffer" option of a window command	|tcl-window-buffer|
The ::vim::current(buffer) variable contains the name of the buffer command
for the current buffer.  A buffer command is automatically deleted when the
corresponding vim buffer is destroyed.  Whenever the buffer's contents are
changed, all marks in the buffer are automatically adjusted.  Any changes to
the buffer's contents made by Tcl commands can be undone with the "undo" vim
command (see |undo|).

Let's assume the name of the buffer command is stored in the Tcl variable "buf",
i.e. "$buf" calls the command.  The following options are available: >

	$buf append {n} {str}	# Append a line to buffer, after line {n}.
	$buf command {cmd}	# Execute Ex command in buffers context.
	$buf count		# Report number of lines in buffer.
	$buf delcmd {cmd}	# Call Tcl command when buffer is deleted.
	$buf delete {n}		# Delete a single line.
	$buf delete {n} {m}	# Delete several lines.
	$buf expr {expr}	# Evaluate vim expression in buffers context.
	$buf get {n}		# Get a single line as a string.
	$buf get {n} {m}	# Get several lines as a list.
	$buf insert {n} {str}	# Insert a line in buffer, as line {n}.
	$buf last		# Report line number of last line in buffer.
	$buf mark {mark}	# Report position of buffer mark.
	$buf name		# Report name of file in buffer.
	$buf number		# Report number of this buffer.
	$buf option {opt} [val]	# Get/Set vim option in buffers context.
	$buf set {n} {text}	# Replace a single line.
	$buf set {n} {m} {list}	# Replace several lines.
	$buf windows		# Create Tcl commands for buffer's windows.
<
							*tcl-linenumbers*
Most buffer commands take line numbers as arguments.  How Tcl treats these
numbers depends on the "::vim::lbase" variable (see |tcl-var-lbase|).  Instead
of line numbers, several keywords can be also used: "top", "start", "begin",
"first", "bottom", "end" and "last".

Options:
	$buf append {n} {str}				*tcl-buffer-append*
	$buf insert {n} {str}				*tcl-buffer-insert*
	Add a line to the buffer.  With the "insert" option, the string
	becomes the new line {n}, with "append" it is inserted after line {n}.
	Example: >
		$buf insert top "This is the beginning."
		$buf append end "This is the end."
<	To add a list of lines to the buffer, use a loop: >
		foreach line $list { $buf append $num $line ; incr num }
<
	$buf count					*tcl-buffer-count*
	Reports the total number of lines in the buffer.

	$buf delcmd {cmd}				*tcl-buffer-delcmd*
	Registers the Tcl command {cmd} as a deletion callback for the buffer.
	This command is executed (in the global scope) just before the buffer
	is deleted.  Complex commands should be build with "list": >
		$buf delcmd [list puts vimerr "buffer [$buf number] gone"]
<	See also |tcl-window-delcmd|.

	$buf delete {n}					*tcl-buffer-delete*
	$buf delete {n} {m}
	Deletes line {n} or lines {n} through {m} from the buffer.
	This example deletes everything except the last line: >
		$buf delete first [expr [$buf last] - 1]
<
	$buf get {n}					*tcl-buffer-get*
	$buf get {n} {m}
	Gets one or more lines from the buffer.  For a single line, the result
	is a string; for several lines, a list of strings.
	Example: >
		set topline [$buf get top]
<
	$buf last					*tcl-buffer-last*
	Reports the line number of the last line.  This value depends on the
	"::vim::lbase" variable.  See |tcl-var-lbase|.

	$buf mark {mark}				*tcl-buffer-mark*
	Reports the position of the named mark as a string, similar to the
	cursor position of the "cursor" option of a window command (see
	|tcl-window-cursor|).  This can be converted to a Tcl array variable: >
		array set mpos [$buf mark "a"]
<	"mpos(column)" and "mpos(row)" now contain the position of the mark.
	If the mark is not set, a standard Tcl error results.

	$buf name
	Reports the name of the file in the buffer.  For a buffer without a
	file, this is an empty string.

	$buf number
	Reports the number of this buffer.  See |:buffers|.
	This example deletes a buffer from vim: >
		::vim::command "bdelete [$buf number]"
<
	$buf set {n} {string}				*tcl-buffer-set*
	$buf set {n} {m} {list}
	Replace one or several lines in the buffer.  If the list contains more
	elements than there are lines to replace, they are inserted into the
	buffer.  If the list contains fewer elements, any unreplaced line is
	deleted from the buffer.

	$buf windows					*tcl-buffer-windows*
	Creates a window command for each window that displays this buffer, and
	returns a list of the command names as the result.
	Example: >
		set winlist [$buf windows]
		foreach win $winlist { $win height 4 }
<	See |tcl-window-cmds| for the available options.

	$buf command [-quiet] {cmd}			*tcl-buffer-command*
	$buf expr {expr}				*tcl-buffer-expr*
	$buf option {opt} [val]				*tcl-buffer-option*
	These are similar to "::vim::command" etc., except that everything is
	done in the context of the buffer represented by $buf, instead of the
	current buffer.  For example, setting an option that is marked 'local
	to buffer' affects the buffer $buf.  Anything that affects or queries
	a window uses the first window in vim's window list that displays this
	buffer (i.e. the first entry in the list returned by "$buf windows").
	See |tcl-command|, |tcl-expr| and |tcl-option| for more information.
	Example: >
		if { [$buf option modified] } { $buf command "w" }

==============================================================================
6. Miscellaneous; Output from Tcl		*tcl-misc* *tcl-output*

The standard Tcl commands "exit" and "catch" are replaced by custom versions.
"exit" terminates the current Tcl script and returns to vim, which deletes the
Tcl interpreter.  Another call to ":tcl" then creates a new Tcl interpreter.
"exit" does NOT terminate vim!  "catch" works as before, except that it does
not prevent script termination from "exit".  An exit code != 0 causes the ex
command that invoked the Tcl script to return an error.

Two new I/O streams are available in Tcl, "vimout" and "vimerr".  All output
directed to them is displayed in the vim message area, as information messages
and error messages, respectively.  The standard Tcl output streams stdout and
stderr are mapped to vimout and vimerr, so that a normal "puts" command can be
used to display messages in vim.

==============================================================================
7. Known bugs & problems				*tcl-bugs*

Calling one of the Tcl Ex commands from inside Tcl (via "::vim::command") may
have unexpected side effects.  The command creates a new interpreter, which
has the same abilities as the standard interpreter - making "::vim::command"
available in a safe child interpreter therefore makes the child unsafe.  (It
would be trivial to block nested :tcl* calls or ensure that such calls from a
safe interpreter create only new safe interpreters, but quite pointless -
depending on vim's configuration, "::vim::command" may execute arbitrary code
in any number of other scripting languages.)  A call to "exit" within this new
interpreter does not affect the old interpreter; it only terminates the new
interpreter, then script processing continues normally in the old interpreter.

Input from stdin is currently not supported.

==============================================================================
8. Examples:						*tcl-examples*

Here are a few small (and maybe useful) Tcl scripts.

This script sorts the lines of the entire buffer (assume it contains a list
of names or something similar):
	set buf $::vim::current(buffer)
	set lines [$buf get top bottom]
	set lines [lsort -dictionary $lines]
	$buf set top bottom $lines

This script reverses the lines in the buffer.  Note the use of "::vim::lbase"
and "$buf last" to work with any line number setting.
	set buf $::vim::current(buffer)
	set t $::vim::lbase
	set b [$buf last]
	while { $t < $b } {
		set tl [$buf get $t]
		set bl [$buf get $b]
		$buf set $t $bl
		$buf set $b $tl
		incr t
		incr b -1
	}

This script adds a consecutive number to each line in the current range:
	set buf $::vim::current(buffer)
	set i $::vim::range(start)
	set n 1
	while { $i <= $::vim::range(end) } {
		set line [$buf get $i]
		$buf set $i "$n\t$line"
		incr i ; incr n
	}

The same can also be done quickly with two Ex commands, using ":tcldo":
	:tcl set n 1
	:[range]tcldo set line "$n\t$line" ; incr n

This procedure runs an Ex command on each buffer (idea stolen from Ron Aaron):
	proc eachbuf { cmd } {
		foreach b [::vim::buffer list] {
			$b command $cmd
		}
	}
Use it like this:
	:tcl eachbuf %s/foo/bar/g
Be careful with Tcl's string and backslash substitution, tough.  If in doubt,
surround the Ex command with curly braces.


If you want to add some Tcl procedures permanently to vim, just place them in
a file (e.g. "~/.vimrc.tcl" on Unix machines), and add these lines to your
startup file (usually "~/.vimrc" on Unix):
	if has("tcl")
		tclfile ~/.vimrc.tcl
	endif

==============================================================================
9. Dynamic loading					*tcl-dynamic*

On MS-Windows and Unix the Tcl library can be loaded dynamically.  The
|:version| output then includes |+tcl/dyn|.

This means that Vim will search for the Tcl DLL or shared library file only
when needed.  When you don't use the Tcl interface you don't need it, thus you
can use Vim without this file.


MS-Windows ~

To use the Tcl interface the Tcl DLL must be in your search path.  In a
console window type "path" to see what directories are used.  The 'tcldll'
option can be also used to specify the Tcl DLL.

The name of the DLL must match the Tcl version Vim was compiled with.
Currently the name is "tcl86.dll".  That is for Tcl 8.6.  To know for sure
edit "gvim.exe" and search for "tcl\d*.dll\c".


Unix ~

The 'tcldll' option can be used to specify the Tcl shared library file instead
of DYNAMIC_TCL_DLL file what was specified at compile time.  The version of
the shared library must match the Tcl version Vim was compiled with.

Last change: 2014 Dec 06


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


This file is about indenting C programs and other files.

1. Indenting C style programs	|C-indenting|
2. Indenting by expression	|indent-expression|

==============================================================================
1. Indenting C style programs				*C-indenting*

The basics for C style indenting are explained in section |30.2| of the user
manual.

Vim has options for automatically indenting C style program files. Many
programming languages including Java and C++ follow very closely the
formatting conventions established with C.  These options affect only the
indent and do not perform other formatting.  There are additional options that
affect other kinds of formatting as well as indenting, see |format-comments|,
|fo-table|, |gq| and |formatting| for the main ones.

Note that this will not work when the |+smartindent| or |+cindent| features
have been disabled at compile time.

There are in fact four main methods available for indentation, each one
overrides the previous if it is enabled, or non-empty for 'indentexpr':
'autoindent'	uses the indent from the previous line.
'smartindent'	is like 'autoindent' but also recognizes some C syntax to
		increase/reduce the indent where appropriate.
'cindent'	Works more cleverly than the other two and is configurable to
		different indenting styles.
'indentexpr'	The most flexible of all: Evaluates an expression to compute
		the indent of a line.  When non-empty this method overrides
		the other ones.  See |indent-expression|.
The rest of this section describes the 'cindent' option.

Note that 'cindent' indenting does not work for every code scenario.  Vim
is not a C compiler: it does not recognize all syntax.  One requirement is
that toplevel functions have a '{' in the first column.  Otherwise they are
easily confused with declarations.

These four options control C program indenting:
'cindent'	Enables Vim to perform C program indenting automatically.
'cinkeys'	Specifies which keys trigger reindenting in insert mode.
'cinoptions'	Sets your preferred indent style.
'cinwords'	Defines keywords that start an extra indent in the next line.

If 'lisp' is not on and 'equalprg' is empty, the "=" operator indents using
Vim's built-in algorithm rather than calling an external program.

See |autocommand| for how to set the 'cindent' option automatically for C code
files and reset it for others.

					*cinkeys-format* *indentkeys-format*
The 'cinkeys' option is a string that controls Vim's indenting in response to
typing certain characters or commands in certain contexts.  Note that this not
only triggers C-indenting.  When 'indentexpr' is not empty 'indentkeys' is
used instead.  The format of 'cinkeys' and 'indentkeys' is equal.

The default is "0{,0},0),:,0#,!^F,o,O,e" which specifies that indenting occurs
as follows:

	"0{"	if you type '{' as the first character in a line
	"0}"	if you type '}' as the first character in a line
	"0)"	if you type ')' as the first character in a line
	":"	if you type ':' after a label or case statement
	"0#"	if you type '#' as the first character in a line
	"!^F"	if you type CTRL-F (which is not inserted)
	"o"	if you type a <CR> anywhere or use the "o" command (not in
		insert mode!)
	"O"	if you use the "O" command (not in insert mode!)
	"e"	if you type the second 'e' for an "else" at the start of a
		line

Characters that can precede each key:				*i_CTRL-F*
!	When a '!' precedes the key, Vim will not insert the key but will
	instead reindent the current line.  This allows you to define a
	command key for reindenting the current line.  CTRL-F is the default
	key for this.  Be careful if you define CTRL-I for this because CTRL-I
	is the ASCII code for <Tab>.
*	When a '*' precedes the key, Vim will reindent the line before
	inserting the key.  If 'cinkeys' contains "*<Return>", Vim reindents
	the current line before opening a new line.
0	When a zero precedes the key (but appears after '!' or '*') Vim will
	reindent the line only if the key is the first character you type in
	the line.  When used before "=" Vim will only reindent the line if
	there is only white space before the word.

When neither '!' nor '*' precedes the key, Vim reindents the line after you
type the key.  So ';' sets the indentation of a line which includes the ';'.

Special key names:
<>	Angle brackets mean spelled-out names of keys.  For example: "<Up>",
	"<Ins>" (see |key-notation|).
^	Letters preceded by a caret (^) are control characters.  For example:
	"^F" is CTRL-F.
o	Reindent a line when you use the "o" command or when Vim opens a new
	line below the current one (e.g., when you type <Enter> in insert
	mode).
O	Reindent a line when you use the "O" command.
e	Reindent a line that starts with "else" when you type the second 'e'.
:	Reindent a line when a ':' is typed which is after a label or case
	statement.  Don't reindent for a ":" in "class::method" for C++.  To
	Reindent for any ":", use "<:>".
=word	Reindent when typing the last character of "word".  "word" may
	actually be part of another word.  Thus "=end" would cause reindenting
	when typing the "d" in "endif" or "endwhile".  But not when typing
	"bend".  Also reindent when completion produces a word that starts
	with "word".  "0=word" reindents when there is only white space before
	the word.
=~word	Like =word, but ignore case.

If you really want to reindent when you type 'o', 'O', 'e', '0', '<', '>',
'*', ':' or '!', use "<o>", "<O>", "<e>", "<0>", "<<>", "<>>", "<*>", "<:>" or
"<!>", respectively, for those keys.

For an emacs-style indent mode where lines aren't indented every time you
press <Enter> but only if you press <Tab>, I suggest:
	:set cinkeys=0{,0},:,0#,!<Tab>,!^F
You might also want to switch off 'autoindent' then.

Note: If you change the current line's indentation manually, Vim ignores the
cindent settings for that line.  This prevents vim from reindenting after you
have changed the indent by typing <BS>, <Tab>, or <Space> in the indent or
used CTRL-T or CTRL-D.

						*cinoptions-values*
The 'cinoptions' option sets how Vim performs indentation.  The value after
the option character can be one of these (N is any number):
	N	indent N spaces
	-N	indent N spaces to the left
	Ns	N times 'shiftwidth' spaces
	-Ns	N times 'shiftwidth' spaces to the left

In the list below,
"N" represents a number of your choice (the number can be negative).  When
there is an 's' after the number, Vim multiplies the number by 'shiftwidth':
"1s" is 'shiftwidth', "2s" is two times 'shiftwidth', etc.  You can use a
decimal point, too: "-0.5s" is minus half a 'shiftwidth'.
The examples below assume a 'shiftwidth' of 4.
							*cino->*
	>N    Amount added for "normal" indent.  Used after a line that should
	      increase the indent (lines starting with "if", an opening brace,

			c3,C0,/0,(2s,us,U0,w0,W0,k0,m0,j0,J0,)20,*70,#0

Vim puts a line in column 1 if:
- It starts with '#' (preprocessor directives), if 'cinkeys' contains '#0'.
- It starts with a label (a keyword followed by ':', other than "case" and
  "default") and 'cinoptions' does not contain an 'L' entry with a positive
  value.
- Any combination of indentations causes the line to have less than 0
  indentation.

==============================================================================
2. Indenting by expression				*indent-expression*

The basics for using flexible indenting are explained in section |30.3| of the
user manual.

If you want to write your own indent file, it must set the 'indentexpr'
option.  Setting the 'indentkeys' option is often useful.  See the
$VIMRUNTIME/indent directory for examples.


REMARKS ABOUT SPECIFIC INDENT FILES ~


CLOJURE					*ft-clojure-indent* *clojure-indent*

Clojure indentation differs somewhat from traditional Lisps, due in part to
the use of square and curly brackets, and otherwise by community convention.
These conventions are not universally followed, so the Clojure indent script
offers a few configurable options, listed below.

If the current vim does not include searchpairpos(), the indent script falls
back to normal 'lisp' indenting, and the following options are ignored.

							*g:clojure_maxlines*

Set maximum scan distance of searchpairpos(). Larger values trade performance
for correctness when dealing with very long forms. A value of 0 will scan
without limits.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_maxlines = 100
<
						*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent*
					*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns*
					*g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist*

The 'lispwords' option is a list of comma-separated words that mark special
forms whose subforms must be indented with two spaces.

For example:
>
	(defn bad []
	      "Incorrect indentation")

	(defn good []
	  "Correct indentation")
<
If you would like to specify 'lispwords' with a |pattern| instead, you can use
the fuzzy indent feature:
>

|g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns| and |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist| are
|Lists| of patterns that will be matched against the unquoted, unqualified
symbol at the head of a list. This means that a pattern like "^foo" will match
all these candidates: "foobar", "my.ns/foobar", and "#'foobar".

Each candidate word is tested for special treatment in this order:

	1. Return true if word is literally in 'lispwords'
	2. Return false if word matches a pattern in
	   |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_blacklist|
	3. Return true if word matches a pattern in
	   |g:clojure_fuzzy_indent_patterns|
	4. Return false and indent normally otherwise

					*g:clojure_special_indent_words*

Some forms in Clojure are indented so that every subform is indented only two
spaces, regardless of 'lispwords'. If you have a custom construct that should
be indented in this idiosyncratic fashion, you can add your symbols to the
default list below.

	let g:clojure_special_indent_words =
	   \ 'deftype,defrecord,reify,proxy,extend-type,extend-protocol,letfn'
<
					*g:clojure_align_multiline_strings*

Align subsequent lines in multiline strings to the column after the opening
quote, instead of the same column.

For example:
>
	(def default
	  "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
	  eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
	  enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
	  nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.")

	(def aligned
	  "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
	   eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut
	   enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
	   nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.")
<
This option is off by default.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_align_multiline_strings = 0
<
						*g:clojure_align_subforms*

By default, parenthesized compound forms that look like function calls and
whose head subform is on its own line have subsequent subforms indented by
two spaces relative to the opening paren:
>
	(foo
	  bar
	  baz)
<
Setting this option changes this behavior so that all subforms are aligned to
the same column, emulating the default behavior of clojure-mode.el:
>
	(foo
	 bar
	 baz)
<
This option is off by default.
>
	" Default
	let g:clojure_align_subforms = 0

FORTRAN							*ft-fortran-indent*

Block if, select case, where, and forall constructs are indented.  So are
type, interface, associate, block, and enum constructs.  The indenting of
subroutines, functions, modules, and program blocks is optional.  Comments,
labelled statements and continuation lines are indented if the Fortran is in
free source form, whereas they are not indented if the Fortran is in fixed
source form because of the left margin requirements.  Hence manual indent
corrections will be necessary for labelled statements and continuation lines
when fixed source form is being used.  For further discussion of the method
used for the detection of source format see |ft-fortran-syntax|.

Do loops ~
All do loops are left unindented by default.  Do loops can be unstructured in
Fortran with (possibly multiple) loops ending on a labelled executable
statement of almost arbitrary type.  Correct indentation requires
compiler-quality parsing.  Old code with do loops ending on labelled statements
of arbitrary type can be indented with elaborate programs such as Tidy
(http://www.unb.ca/chem/ajit/f_tidy.htm).  Structured do/continue loops are
also left unindented because continue statements are also used for purposes
other than ending a do loop.  Programs such as Tidy can convert structured
do/continue loops to the do/enddo form.  Do loops of the do/enddo variety can
be indented.  If you use only structured loops of the do/enddo form, you should
declare this by setting the fortran_do_enddo variable in your .vimrc as
follows >

   let fortran_do_enddo=1

in which case do loops will be indented.  If all your loops are of do/enddo
type only in, say, .f90 files, then you should set a buffer flag with an
autocommand such as >

  au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.f90 let b:fortran_do_enddo=1

to get do loops indented in .f90 files and left alone in Fortran files with
other extensions such as .for.

Program units ~
The indenting of program units (subroutines, functions, modules, and program
blocks) is enabled by default but can be suppressed if a lighter, screen-width
preserving indent style is desired.  To suppress the indenting of program
units for all fortran files set the global fortran_indent_less variable in
your .vimrc as follows >

  let fortran_indent_less=1

A finer level of suppression can be achieved by setting the corresponding
buffer-local variable as follows >

  let b:fortran_indent_less=1


HTML				*ft-html-indent* *html-indent* *html-indenting*

This is about variables you can set in your vimrc to customize HTML indenting.

You can set the indent for the first line after <script> and <style>
"blocktags" (default "zero"): >

      :let g:html_indent_script1 = "inc"
      :let g:html_indent_style1 = "inc"
<
      VALUE	MEANING ~
      "zero"	zero indent
      "auto"	auto indent (same indent as the blocktag)
      "inc"	auto indent + one indent step

Many tags increase the indent for what follows per default (see "Add Indent
Tags" in the script).  You can add further tags with: >

      :let g:html_indent_inctags = "html,body,head,tbody"

You can also remove such tags with: >

      :let g:html_indent_autotags = "th,td,tr,tfoot,thead"

Default value is empty for both variables.  Note: the initial "inctags" are
only defined once per Vim session.

User variables are only read when the script is sourced.  To enable your
changes during a session, without reloading the HTML file, you can manually
do: >

      :call HtmlIndent_CheckUserSettings()

Detail:
  Calculation of indent inside "blocktags" with "alien" content:
      BLOCKTAG   INDENT EXPR	    WHEN APPLICABLE ~
      <script> : {customizable}	    if first line of block
	       : cindent(v:lnum)    if attributes empty or contain "java"
	       : -1		    else (vbscript, tcl, ...)
      <style>  : {customizable}	    if first line of block
	       : GetCSSIndent()	    else
      <!-- --> : -1


PHP				*ft-php-indent* *php-indent* *php-indenting*

NOTE:	PHP files will be indented correctly only if PHP |syntax| is active.

If you are editing a file in Unix 'fileformat' and '\r' characters are present
before new lines, indentation won't proceed correctly ; you have to remove
those useless characters first with a command like: >

    :%s /\r$//g

Or, you can simply |:let| the variable PHP_removeCRwhenUnix to 1 and the
script will silently remove them when Vim loads a PHP file (at each |BufRead|).

OPTIONS: ~

PHP indenting can be altered in several ways by modifying the values of some
global variables:

					*php-comment* *PHP_autoformatcomment*
To not enable auto-formatting of comments by default (if you want to use your
own 'formatoptions'): >
    :let g:PHP_autoformatcomment = 0

Else, 't' will be removed from the 'formatoptions' string and "qrowcb" will be
added, see |fo-table| for more information.
-------------

							*PHP_outdentSLComments*
To add extra indentation to single-line comments: >
    :let g:PHP_outdentSLComments = N

With N being the number of 'shiftwidth' to add.

Only single-line comments will be affected such as: >
    # Comment
    // Comment
    /* Comment */
-------------

							*PHP_default_indenting*
To add extra indentation to every PHP lines with N being the number of
'shiftwidth' to add: >
    :let g:PHP_default_indenting = N

For example, with N = 1, this will give:
>
    <?php
	if (!isset($History_lst_sel))
	    if (!isset($History_lst_sel))
		if (!isset($History_lst_sel)) {
		    $History_lst_sel=0;
		} else
		    $foo="bar";

	$command_hist = TRUE;
    ?>
(Notice the extra indentation between the PHP container markers and the code)
-------------

							*PHP_outdentphpescape*
To indent PHP escape tags as the surrounding non-PHP code (only affects the
PHP escape tags): >
:let g:PHP_outdentphpescape = 0
-------------

							*PHP_removeCRwhenUnix*
To automatically remove '\r' characters when the 'fileformat' is set to Unix: >
    :let g:PHP_removeCRwhenUnix = 1
-------------

							*PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel*
To indent braces at the same level than the code they contain: >
    :let g:PHP_BracesAtCodeLevel = 1
    
This will give the following result: >
    if ($foo)
	{
	foo();
	}
Instead of: >
    if ($foo)
    {
	foo();
    }

NOTE:	Indenting will be a bit slower if this option is used because some
	optimizations won't be available.
-------------

							*PHP_vintage_case_default_indent*
To indent 'case:' and 'default:' statements in switch() blocks: >
    :let g:PHP_vintage_case_default_indent = 1

In PHP braces are not required inside 'case/default' blocks therefore 'case:'
and 'default:' are indented at the same level than the 'switch()' to avoid
meaningless indentation. You can use the above option to return to the
traditional way.


PYTHON							*ft-python-indent*

The amount of indent can be set for the following situations.  The examples
given are the defaults.  Note that the variables are set to an expression, so
that you can change the value of 'shiftwidth' later.

Indent after an open paren: >
	let g:pyindent_open_paren = '&sw * 2'
Indent after a nested paren: >
	let g:pyindent_nested_paren = '&sw'
Indent for a continuation line: >
	let g:pyindent_continue = '&sw * 2'


R								*ft-r-indent*

Function arguments are aligned if they span for multiple lines. If you prefer
do not have the arguments of functions aligned, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_align_args = 0
<
All lines beginning with a comment character, #, get the same indentation
level of the normal R code. Users of Emacs/ESS may be used to have lines
beginning with a single # indented in the 40th column, ## indented as R code,
and ### not indented. If you prefer that lines beginning with comment
characters are aligned as they are by Emacs/ESS, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_comments = 1
<
If you prefer that lines beginning with a single # are aligned at a column
different from the 40th one, you should set a new value to the variable
r_indent_comment_column, as in the example below:
>
   let r_indent_comment_column = 30
<
Any code after a line that ends with "<-" is indented. Emacs/ESS does not
indent the code if it is a top level function. If you prefer that the
Vim-R-plugin behaves like Emacs/ESS in this regard, put in your |vimrc|:
>
   let r_indent_ess_compatible = 1
<
Below is an example of indentation with and without this option enabled:
>
   ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 1           ### r_indent_ess_compatible = 0
   foo <-                                    foo <-
       function(x)                               function(x)
   {                                             {
       paste(x)                                      paste(x)
   }                                             }
<

SHELL							*ft-sh-indent*

The amount of indent applied under various circumstances in a shell file can
be configured by setting the following keys in the |Dictionary|
b:sh_indent_defaults to a specific amount or to a |Funcref| that references a
function that will return the amount desired:

b:sh_indent_options['default']	Default amount of indent.

b:sh_indent_options['continuation-line']
				Amount of indent to add to a continued line.

b:sh_indent_options['case-labels']
				Amount of indent to add for case labels.
				(not actually implemented)

b:sh_indent_options['case-statements']
				Amount of indent to add for case statements.

b:sh_indent_options['case-breaks']
				Amount of indent to add (or more likely
				remove) for case breaks.

VERILOG							*ft-verilog-indent*

General block statements such as if, for, case, always, initial, function,
specify and begin, etc., are indented.  The module block statements (first
level blocks) are not indented by default.  you can turn on the indent with
setting a variable in the .vimrc as follows: >

  let b:verilog_indent_modules = 1

then the module blocks will be indented.  To stop this, remove the variable: >

  :unlet b:verilog_indent_modules

To set the variable only for Verilog file.  The following statements can be
used: >

  au BufReadPost * if exists("b:current_syntax")
  au BufReadPost *   if b:current_syntax == "verilog"
  au BufReadPost *     let b:verilog_indent_modules = 1
  au BufReadPost *   endif
  au BufReadPost * endif

Furthermore, setting the variable b:verilog_indent_width to change the
indenting width (default is 'shiftwidth'): >

  let b:verilog_indent_width = 4
  let b:verilog_indent_width = &sw * 2

In addition, you can turn the verbose mode for debug issue: >

  let b:verilog_indent_verbose = 1

Make sure to do ":set cmdheight=2" first to allow the display of the message.


VHDL							*ft-vhdl-indent*

Alignment of generic/port mapping statements are performed by default. This
causes the following alignment example: >

  ENTITY sync IS
  PORT (
         clk        : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         reset_n    : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         data_input : IN  STD_LOGIC;
         data_out   : OUT STD_LOGIC
       );
  END ENTITY sync;

To turn this off, add >

  let g:vhdl_indent_genportmap = 0

to the .vimrc file, which causes the previous alignment example to change: >

  ENTITY sync IS
  PORT (
    clk        : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    reset_n    : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    data_input : IN  STD_LOGIC;
    data_out   : OUT STD_LOGIC
  );
  END ENTITY sync;

----------------------------------------

Alignment of right-hand side assignment "<=" statements are performed by
default. This causes the following alignment example: >

  sig_out <= (bus_a(1) AND
             (sig_b OR sig_c)) OR
             (bus_a(0) AND sig_d);

To turn this off, add >

  let g:vhdl_indent_rhsassign = 0

to the .vimrc file, which causes the previous alignment example to change: >

  sig_out <= (bus_a(1) AND
    (sig_b OR sig_c)) OR
    (bus_a(0) AND sig_d);

----------------------------------------

Full-line comments (lines that begin with "--") are indented to be aligned with
the very previous line's comment, PROVIDED that a whitespace follows after
"--".

For example: >

  sig_a <= sig_b; -- start of a comment
                  -- continuation of the comment
                  -- more of the same comment

While in Insert mode, after typing "-- " (note the space " "), hitting CTRL-F
will align the current "-- " with the previous line's "--".

If the very previous line does not contain "--", THEN the full-line comment
will be aligned with the start of the next non-blank line that is NOT a
full-line comment.

Indenting the following code: >

  sig_c <= sig_d; -- comment 0
         -- comment 1
               -- comment 2
    --debug_code:
    --PROCESS(debug_in)
         --BEGIN
            --  FOR i IN 15 DOWNTO 0 LOOP
             --    debug_out(8*i+7 DOWNTO 8*i) <= debug_in(15-i);
            --  END LOOP;
     --END PROCESS debug_code;

      -- comment 3
  sig_e <= sig_f; -- comment 4
           -- comment 5

results in: >

  sig_c <= sig_d; -- comment 0
                  -- comment 1
                  -- comment 2
  --debug_code:
  --PROCESS(debug_in)
  --BEGIN
  --  FOR i IN 15 DOWNTO 0 LOOP
  --    debug_out(8*i+7 DOWNTO 8*i) <= debug_in(15-i);
  --  END LOOP;
  --END PROCESS debug_code;

  -- comment 3
  sig_e <= sig_f; -- comment 4
                  -- comment 5

Notice that "--debug_code:" does not align with "-- comment 2"
because there is no whitespace that follows after "--" in "--debug_code:".

Given the dynamic nature of indenting comments, indenting should be done TWICE.
On the first pass, code will be indented. On the second pass, full-line
comments will be indented according to the correctly indented code.


VIM							*ft-vim-indent*

For indenting Vim scripts there is one variable that specifies the amount of
indent for a continuation line, a line that starts with a backslash: >

	:let g:vim_indent_cont = &sw * 3

Three times shiftwidth is the default value.

==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*intro*

Vim stands for Vi IMproved.  It used to be Vi IMitation, but there are so many
improvements that a name change was appropriate.  Vim is a text editor which
includes almost all the commands from the Unix program "Vi" and a lot of new
ones.  It is very useful for editing programs and other plain text.
   All commands are given with the keyboard.  This has the advantage that you
can keep your fingers on the keyboard and your eyes on the screen.  For those
who want it, there is mouse support and a GUI version with scrollbars and
menus (see |gui.txt|).

An overview of this manual can be found in the file "help.txt", |help.txt|.
It can be accessed from within Vim with the <Help> or <F1> key and with the
|:help| command (just type ":help", without the bars or quotes).
   The 'helpfile' option can be set to the name of the help file, in case it
is not located in the default place.  You can jump to subjects like with tags:
Use CTRL-] to jump to a subject under the cursor, use CTRL-T to jump back.

Throughout this manual the differences between Vi and Vim are mentioned in
curly braces, like this: {Vi does not have on-line help}.  See |vi_diff.txt|
for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

This manual refers to Vim on various machines.  There may be small differences
between different computers and terminals.  Besides the remarks given in this
document, there is a separate document for each supported system, see
|sys-file-list|.

							*pronounce*
Vim is pronounced as one word, like Jim, not vi-ai-em.  It's written with a
capital, since it's a name, again like Jim.

This manual is a reference for all the Vim commands and options.  This is not
an introduction to the use of Vi or Vim, it gets a bit complicated here and
there.  For beginners, there is a hands-on |tutor|.  To learn using Vim, read
the user manual |usr_toc.txt|.

							*book*
There are many books on Vi that contain a section for beginners.  There are
two books I can recommend:

	"Vim - Vi Improved" by Steve Oualline

This is the very first book completely dedicated to Vim.  It is very good for
beginners.  The most often used commands are explained with pictures and
examples.  The less often used commands are also explained, the more advanced
features are summarized.  There is a comprehensive index and a quick
reference.  Parts of this book have been included in the user manual
|frombook|.

	http://www.vim.org/iccf/click5.html

	"Learning the Vi editor" by Linda Lamb and Arnold Robbins

This is a book about Vi that includes a chapter on Vim (in the sixth edition).
The first steps in Vi are explained very well.  The commands that Vim adds are
only briefly mentioned.  There is also a German translation.

mention that.

						*mail-list* *maillist*
There are several mailing lists for Vim:
<vim@vim.org>					*vim-use* *vim_use*
	For discussions about using existing versions of Vim: Useful mappings,
	questions, answers, where to get a specific version, etc.  There are
	quite a few people watching this list and answering questions, also
	for beginners.  Don't hesitate to ask your question here.

Bug reports:				*bugs* *bug-reports* *bugreport.vim*

There are two ways to report bugs, both work:
1. Send bug reports to: Vim Developers <vim-dev@vim.org>
   This is a maillist, you need to become a member first and many people will
   see the message.  If you don't want that, e.g. because it is a security
   issue, send it to <bugs@vim.org>, this only goes to the Vim maintainer
   (that's Bram).
2. Open issue on GitHub: https://github.com/vim/vim/issues
   The text will be forwarded to the vim-dev maillist.

Please be brief; all the time that is spent on answering mail is subtracted
from the time that is spent on improving Vim!  Always give a reproducible
example and try to find out which settings or other things influence the
appearance of the bug.  Try different machines, if possible.  Send me patches
if you can!

It will help to include information about the version of Vim you are using and
your setup.  You can get the information with this command: >
   :so $VIMRUNTIME/bugreport.vim
This will create a file "bugreport.txt" in the current directory, with a lot
of information of your environment.  Before sending this out, check if it
doesn't contain any confidential information!

If Vim crashes, please try to find out where.  You can find help on this here:
|debug.txt|.

In case of doubt or when you wonder if the problem has already been fixed but
you can't find a fix for it, become a member of the vim-dev maillist and ask
your question there. |maillist|

							*year-2000* *Y2K*
Since Vim internally doesn't use dates for editing, there is no year 2000
problem to worry about.  Vim does use the time in the form of seconds since
January 1st 1970.  It is used for a time-stamp check of the edited file and
the swap file, which is not critical and should only cause warning messages.

There might be a year 2038 problem, when the seconds don't fit in a 32 bit int
anymore.  This depends on the compiler, libraries and operating system.
Specifically, time_t and the ctime() function are used.  And the time_t is
stored in four bytes in the swap file.  But that's only used for printing a
file date/time for recovery, it will never affect normal editing.

The Vim strftime() function directly uses the strftime() system function.
localtime() uses the time() system function.  getftime() uses the time
returned by the stat() system function.  If your system libraries are year
2000 compliant, Vim is too.

The user may create scripts for Vim that use external commands.  These might
introduce Y2K problems, but those are not really part of Vim itself.

In this documentation there are several references to other versions of Vi:
							*Vi* *vi*
Vi	"the original".  Without further remarks this is the version
	of Vi that appeared in Sun OS 4.x.  ":version" returns
	"Version 3.7, 6/7/85".  Sometimes other versions are referred
	to.  Only runs under Unix.  Source code only available with a
	license.  More information on Vi can be found through:
		http://vi-editor.org	[doesn't currently work...]
							*Posix*
Posix	From the IEEE standard 1003.2, Part 2: Shell and utilities.
	Generally known as "Posix".  This is a textual description of
	how Vi is supposed to work.
	See |posix-compliance|.
							*Nvi*
Nvi	The "New" Vi.  The version of Vi that comes with BSD 4.4 and FreeBSD.
	Very good compatibility with the original Vi, with a few extensions.
	The version used is 1.79.  ":version" returns "Version 1.79
	(10/23/96)".  There has been no release the last few years, although
	there is a development version 1.81.
	Source code is freely available.
							*Elvis*
Elvis	Another Vi clone, made by Steve Kirkendall.  Very compact but isn't
	as flexible as Vim.
	The version used is 2.1.  It is still being developed.  Source code is
	freely available.

==============================================================================
4. Notation						*notation*

When syntax highlighting is used to read this, text that is not typed
literally is often highlighted with the Special group.  These are items in [],
{} and <>, and CTRL-X.

Note that Vim uses all possible characters in commands.  Sometimes the [], {}
and <> are part of what you type, the context should make this clear.


[]		Characters in square brackets are optional.

						    *count* *[count]*
[count]		An optional number that may precede the command to multiply
		or iterate the command.  If no number is given, a count of one
		is used, unless otherwise noted.  Note that in this manual the
		[count] is not mentioned in the description of the command,
		but only in the explanation.  This was done to make the
		commands easier to look up.  If the 'showcmd' option is on,
		the (partially) entered count is shown at the bottom of the
		window.  You can use <Del> to erase the last digit (|N<Del>|).

							*[quotex]*
["x]		An optional register designation where text can be stored.
		See |registers|.  The x is a single character between 'a' and
		'z' or 'A' and 'Z' or '"', and in some cases (with the put
		command) between '0' and '9', '%', '#', or others.  The
		uppercase and lowercase letter designate the same register,
		but the lowercase letter is used to overwrite the previous
		register contents, while the uppercase letter is used to
		append to the previous register contents.  Without the ""x" or
		with """" the stored text is put into the unnamed register.

							*{}*
{}		Curly braces denote parts of the command which must appear,
		but which can take a number of different values.  The
		differences between Vim and Vi are also given in curly braces
		(this will be clear from the context).

							*{char1-char2}*
{char1-char2}	A single character from the range char1 to char2.  For
		example: {a-z} is a lowercase letter.  Multiple ranges may be
		concatenated.  For example, {a-zA-Z0-9} is any alphanumeric
		character.

						*{motion}* *movement*
{motion}	A command that moves the cursor.  These are explained in
		|motion.txt|.  Examples:
			w		to start of next word
			b		to begin of current word
			4j		four lines down
			/The<CR>	to next occurrence of "The"
		This is used after an |operator| command to move over the text
		that is to be operated upon.
		- If the motion includes a count and the operator also has a
		  count, the two counts are multiplied.  For example: "2d3w"
		  deletes six words.
		- The motion can be backwards, e.g. "db" to delete to the
		  start of the word.
		- The motion can also be a mouse click.  The mouse is not
		  supported in every terminal though.
		- The ":omap" command can be used to map characters while an
		  operator is pending.
		- Ex commands can be used to move the cursor.  This can be
		  used to call a function that does some complicated motion.
		  The motion is always characterwise exclusive, no matter
		  what ":" command is used.  This means it's impossible to
		  include the last character of a line without the line break
		  (unless 'virtualedit' is set).
		  If the Ex command changes the text before where the operator
		  starts or jumps to another buffer the result is
		  unpredictable.  It is possible to change the text further
		  down.  Jumping to another buffer is possible if the current
		  buffer is not unloaded.

							*{Visual}*
{Visual}	A selected text area.  It is started with the "v", "V", or
		CTRL-V command, then any cursor movement command can be used
		to change the end of the selected text.
		This is used before an |operator| command to highlight the
		text that is to be operated upon.
		See |Visual-mode|.

							*<character>*
<character>	A special character from the table below, optionally with
		modifiers, or a single ASCII character with modifiers.

							*'character'*
'c'		A single ASCII character.

							*CTRL-{char}*
CTRL-{char}	{char} typed as a control character; that is, typing {char}
		while holding the CTRL key down.  The case of {char} does not
		matter; thus CTRL-A and CTRL-a are equivalent.  But on some
		terminals, using the SHIFT key will produce another code,
		don't use it then.

							*'option'*
'option'	An option, or parameter, that can be set to a value, is
		enclosed in single quotes.  See |options|.

							*quotecommandquote*
"command"	A reference to a command that you can type is enclosed in
		double quotes.
`command`	New style command, this distinguishes it from other quoted
		text and strings.

					*key-notation* *key-codes* *keycodes*
These names for keys are used in the documentation.  They can also be used
with the ":map" command (insert the key name by pressing CTRL-K and then the
key you want the name for).

<A-...>		same as <M-...>			*<A-*
<D-...>		command-key (Macintosh only)	*<D-*
<t_xx>		key with "xx" entry in termcap
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The shifted cursor keys, the help key, and the undo key are only
available on a few terminals.  On the Amiga, shifted function key 10 produces
a code (CSI) that is also used by key sequences.  It will be recognized only
after typing another key.

Note: There are two codes for the delete key.  127 is the decimal ASCII value
for the delete key, which is always recognized.  Some delete keys send another
value, in which case this value is obtained from the termcap entry "kD".  Both
values have the same effect.  Also see |:fixdel|.

Note: The keypad keys are used in the same way as the corresponding "normal"
keys.  For example, <kHome> has the same effect as <Home>.  If a keypad key
sends the same raw key code as its non-keypad equivalent, it will be
recognized as the non-keypad code.  For example, when <kHome> sends the same
code as <Home>, when pressing <kHome> Vim will think <Home> was pressed.
Mapping <kHome> will not work then.

								*<>*
Examples are often given in the <> notation.  Sometimes this is just to make
clear what you need to type, but often it can be typed literally, e.g., with
the ":map" command.  The rules are:
 1.  Any printable characters are typed directly, except backslash and '<'
 2.  A backslash is represented with "\\", double backslash, or "<Bslash>".
 3.  A real '<' is represented with "\<" or "<lt>".  When there is no
     confusion possible, a '<' can be used directly.
 4.  "<key>" means the special key typed.  This is the notation explained in
     the table above.  A few examples:
	   <Esc>		Escape key
	   <C-G>		CTRL-G
	   <Up>			cursor up key
	   <C-LeftMouse>	Control- left mouse click
	   <S-F11>		Shifted function key 11
	   <M-a>		Meta- a  ('a' with bit 8 set)
	   <M-A>		Meta- A  ('A' with bit 8 set)
	   <t_kd>		"kd" termcap entry (cursor down key)

If you want to use the full <> notation in Vim, you have to make sure the '<'
flag is excluded from 'cpoptions' (when 'compatible' is not set, it already is
by default). >
	:set cpo-=<
The <> notation uses <lt> to escape the special meaning of key names.  Using a
backslash also works, but only when 'cpoptions' does not include the 'B' flag.

Examples for mapping CTRL-H to the six characters "<Home>": >
	:imap <C-H> \<Home>
	:imap <C-H> <lt>Home>
The first one only works when the 'B' flag is not in 'cpoptions'.  The second
one always works.
To get a literal "<lt>" in a mapping: >
	:map <C-L> <lt>lt>

For mapping, abbreviation and menu commands you can then copy-paste the
examples and use them directly.  Or type them literally, including the '<' and
'>' characters.  This does NOT work for other commands, like ":set" and
":autocmd"!

==============================================================================
5. Modes, introduction				*vim-modes-intro* *vim-modes*

Vim has six BASIC modes:

					*Normal* *Normal-mode* *command-mode*
Normal mode		In Normal mode you can enter all the normal editor
			commands.  If you start the editor you are in this
			mode (unless you have set the 'insertmode' option,
			see below).  This is also known as command mode.

Visual mode		This is like Normal mode, but the movement commands
			extend a highlighted area.  When a non-movement
			command is used, it is executed for the highlighted
			area.  See |Visual-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- VISUAL --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Select mode		This looks most like the MS-Windows selection mode.
			Typing a printable character deletes the selection
			and starts Insert mode.  See |Select-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- SELECT --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Insert mode		In Insert mode the text you type is inserted into the
			buffer.  See |Insert-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- INSERT --" is shown
			at the bottom of the window.

Command-line mode	In Command-line mode (also called Cmdline mode) you
Cmdline mode		can enter one line of text at the bottom of the
			window.  This is for the Ex commands, ":", the pattern
			search commands, "?" and "/", and the filter command,
			"!".  |Cmdline-mode|

Ex mode			Like Command-line mode, but after entering a command
			you remain in Ex mode.  Very limited editing of the
			command line.  |Ex-mode|

There are six ADDITIONAL modes.  These are variants of the BASIC modes:

				*Operator-pending* *Operator-pending-mode*
Operator-pending mode	This is like Normal mode, but after an operator
			command has started, and Vim is waiting for a {motion}
			to specify the text that the operator will work on.

Replace mode		Replace mode is a special case of Insert mode.  You
			can do the same things as in Insert mode, but for
			each character you enter, one character of the existing
			text is deleted.  See |Replace-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- REPLACE --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Virtual Replace mode	Virtual Replace mode is similar to Replace mode, but
			instead of file characters you are replacing screen
			real estate.  See |Virtual-Replace-mode|.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- VREPLACE --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Insert Normal mode	Entered when CTRL-O given in Insert mode.  This is
			like Normal mode, but after executing one command Vim
			returns to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) --" is
			shown at the bottom of the window.

Insert Visual mode	Entered when starting a Visual selection from Insert
			mode, e.g., by using CTRL-O and then "v", "V" or
			CTRL-V.  When the Visual selection ends, Vim returns
			to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) VISUAL --"
			is shown at the bottom of the window.

Insert Select mode	Entered when starting Select mode from Insert mode.
			E.g., by dragging the mouse or <S-Right>.
			When the Select mode ends, Vim returns to Insert mode.
			If the 'showmode' option is on "-- (insert) SELECT --"
			is shown at the bottom of the window.

==============================================================================
6. Switching from mode to mode				*mode-switching*

If for any reason you do not know which mode you are in, you can always get
back to Normal mode by typing <Esc> twice.  This doesn't work for Ex mode
though, use ":visual".
You will know you are back in Normal mode when you see the screen flash or
hear the bell after you type <Esc>.  However, when pressing <Esc> after using
CTRL-O in Insert mode you get a beep but you are still in Insert mode, type
<Esc> again.

							*i_esc*
		TO mode						    ~
		Normal	Visual	Select	Insert	  Replace   Cmd-line  Ex ~
FROM mode								 ~
Normal			v V ^V	  *4	 *1	   R gR     : / ? !   Q
Visual		 *2		  ^G	 c C	    --	      :       --
Select		 *5	^O ^G		 *6	    --	      --      --
Insert		 <Esc>	  --	  --		  <Insert>    --      --
Replace		 <Esc>	  --	  --	<Insert>	      --      --
Command-line	 *3	  --	  --	 :start	    --		      --
Ex		 :vi	  --	  --	 --	    --	      --

-- not possible

*1 Go from Normal mode to Insert mode by giving the command "i", "I", "a",
   "A", "o", "O", "c", "C", "s" or S".
*2 Go from Visual mode to Normal mode by giving a non-movement command, which
   causes the command to be executed, or by hitting <Esc> "v", "V" or "CTRL-V"
   (see |v_v|), which just stops Visual mode without side effects.
*3 Go from Command-line mode to Normal mode by:
   - Hitting <CR> or <NL>, which causes the entered command to be executed.
   - Deleting the complete line (e.g., with CTRL-U) and giving a final <BS>.
   - Hitting CTRL-C or <Esc>, which quits the command-line without executing
     the command.
   In the last case <Esc> may be the character defined with the 'wildchar'
   option, in which case it will start command-line completion.  You can
   ignore that and type <Esc> again.  {Vi: when hitting <Esc> the command-line
   is executed.  This is unexpected for most people; therefore it was changed
   in Vim.  But when the <Esc> is part of a mapping, the command-line is
   executed.  If you want the Vi behaviour also when typing <Esc>, use ":cmap
   ^V<Esc> ^V^M"}
*4 Go from Normal to Select mode by:
   - use the mouse to select text while 'selectmode' contains "mouse"
   - use a non-printable command to move the cursor while keeping the Shift
     key pressed, and the 'selectmode' option contains "key"
   - use "v", "V" or "CTRL-V" while 'selectmode' contains "cmd"
   - use "gh", "gH" or "g CTRL-H"  |g_CTRL-H|
*5 Go from Select mode to Normal mode by using a non-printable command to move
   the cursor, without keeping the Shift key pressed.
*6 Go from Select mode to Insert mode by typing a printable character.  The
   selection is deleted and the character is inserted.

If the 'insertmode' option is on, editing a file will start in Insert mode.

	*CTRL-\_CTRL-N* *i_CTRL-\_CTRL-N* *c_CTRL-\_CTRL-N* *v_CTRL-\_CTRL-N*
Additionally the command CTRL-\ CTRL-N or <C-\><C-N> can be used to go to
Normal mode from any other mode.  This can be used to make sure Vim is in
Normal mode, without causing a beep like <Esc> would.  However, this does not
work in Ex mode.  When used after a command that takes an argument, such as
|f| or |m|, the timeout set with 'ttimeoutlen' applies.

	*CTRL-\_CTRL-G* *i_CTRL-\_CTRL-G* *c_CTRL-\_CTRL-G* *v_CTRL-\_CTRL-G*
The command CTRL-\ CTRL-G or <C-\><C-G> can be used to go to Insert mode when
'insertmode' is set.  Otherwise it goes to Normal mode.  This can be used to
make sure Vim is in the mode indicated by 'insertmode', without knowing in
what mode Vim currently is.

				    *Q* *mode-Ex* *Ex-mode* *Ex* *EX* *E501*
Q			Switch to "Ex" mode.  This is a bit like typing ":"
			commands one after another, except:
			- You don't have to keep pressing ":".
			- The screen doesn't get updated after each command.
			- There is no normal command-line editing.
			- Mappings and abbreviations are not used.
			In fact, you are editing the lines with the "standard"
			line-input editing commands (<Del> or <BS> to erase,
			CTRL-U to kill the whole line).
			Vim will enter this mode by default if it's invoked as
			"ex" on the command-line.
			Use the ":vi" command |:visual| to exit "Ex" mode.
			Note: In older versions of Vim "Q" formatted text,
			that is now done with |gq|.  But if you use the
			|vimrc_example.vim| script "Q" works like "gq".

					*gQ*
gQ			Switch to "Ex" mode like with "Q", but really behave
			like typing ":" commands after another.  All command
			line editing, completion etc. is available.
			Use the ":vi" command |:visual| to exit "Ex" mode.
			{not in Vi}

==============================================================================
7. The window contents					*window-contents*

In Normal mode and Insert/Replace mode the screen window will show the current
contents of the buffer: What You See Is What You Get.  There are two
exceptions:
- When the 'cpoptions' option contains '$', and the change is within one line,
  the text is not directly deleted, but a '$' is put at the last deleted
  character.
- When inserting text in one window, other windows on the same text are not
  updated until the insert is finished.
{Vi: The screen is not always updated on slow terminals}

Lines longer than the window width will wrap, unless the 'wrap' option is off
(see below).  The 'linebreak' option can be set to wrap at a blank character.

If the window has room after the last line of the buffer, Vim will show '~' in
the first column of the last lines in the window, like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|some line		|
	|last line		|
	|~			|
	|~			|
	+-----------------------+

Thus the '~' lines indicate that the end of the buffer was reached.

If the last line in a window doesn't fit, Vim will indicate this with a '@' in
the first column of the last lines in the window, like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|first line		|
	|second line		|
	|@			|
	|@			|
	+-----------------------+

Thus the '@' lines indicate that there is a line that doesn't fit in the
window.

When the "lastline" flag is present in the 'display' option, you will not see
'@' characters at the left side of window.  If the last line doesn't fit
completely, only the part that fits is shown, and the last three characters of
the last line are replaced with "@@@", like this:

	+-----------------------+
	|first line		|
	|second line		|
	|a very long line that d|
	|oesn't fit in the wi@@@|
	+-----------------------+

If there is a single line that is too long to fit in the window, this is a
special situation.  Vim will show only part of the line, around where the
cursor is.  There are no special characters shown, so that you can edit all
parts of this line.
{Vi: gives an "internal error" on lines that do not fit in the window}

The '@' occasion in the 'highlight' option can be used to set special
highlighting for the '@' and '~' characters.  This makes it possible to
distinguish them from real characters in the buffer.

The 'showbreak' option contains the string to put in front of wrapped lines.

							*wrap-off*
If the 'wrap' option is off, long lines will not wrap.  Only the part that
fits on the screen is shown.  If the cursor is moved to a part of the line
that is not shown, the screen is scrolled horizontally.  The advantage of
this method is that columns are shown as they are and lines that cannot fit
on the screen can be edited.  The disadvantage is that you cannot see all the
characters of a line at once.  The 'sidescroll' option can be set to the
minimal number of columns to scroll.  {Vi: has no 'wrap' option}

All normal ASCII characters are displayed directly on the screen.  The <Tab>
is replaced with the number of spaces that it represents.  Other non-printing
characters are replaced with "^{char}", where {char} is the non-printing
character with 64 added.  Thus character 7 (bell) will be shown as "^G".
Characters between 127 and 160 are replaced with "~{char}", where {char} is
the character with 64 subtracted.  These characters occupy more than one
position on the screen.  The cursor can only be positioned on the first one.

If you set the 'number' option, all lines will be preceded with their
number.  Tip: If you don't like wrapping lines to mix with the line numbers,
set the 'showbreak' option to eight spaces:
	":set showbreak=\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "

If you set the 'list' option, <Tab> characters will not be shown as several
spaces, but as "^I".  A '$' will be placed at the end of the line, so you can
find trailing blanks.

In Command-line mode only the command-line itself is shown correctly.  The
display of the buffer contents is updated as soon as you go back to Command
mode.

The last line of the window is used for status and other messages.  The
status messages will only be used if an option is on:

status message			option	     default	Unix default	~
current mode			'showmode'	on	    on
command characters		'showcmd'	on	    off
cursor position			'ruler'		off	    off

The current mode is "-- INSERT --" or "-- REPLACE --", see |'showmode'|.  The
command characters are those that you typed but were not used yet.  {Vi: does
not show the characters you typed or the cursor position}

If you have a slow terminal you can switch off the status messages to speed
up editing:
	:set nosc noru nosm

If there is an error, an error message will be shown for at least one second
(in reverse video).  {Vi: error messages may be overwritten with other
messages before you have a chance to read them}

Some commands show how many lines were affected.  Above which threshold this
happens can be controlled with the 'report' option (default 2).

On the Amiga Vim will run in a CLI window.  The name Vim and the full name of
the current file name will be shown in the title bar.  When the window is
resized, Vim will automatically redraw the window.  You may make the window as
small as you like, but if it gets too small not a single line will fit in it.
Make it at least 40 characters wide to be able to read most messages on the
last line.

On most Unix systems, resizing the window is recognized and handled correctly
by Vim.  {Vi: not ok}

==============================================================================
8. Definitions						*definitions*

  screen		The whole area that Vim uses to work in.  This can be
			a terminal emulator window.  Also called "the Vim
			window".
  window		A view on a buffer.

A screen contains one or more windows, separated by status lines and with the
command line at the bottom.

	+-------------------------------+
screen	| window 1	| window 2	|
	|		|		|
	|		|		|
	|= status line =|= status line =|
	| window 3			|
	|				|
	|				|
	|==== status line ==============|
	|command line			|
	+-------------------------------+

The command line is also used for messages.  It scrolls up the screen when
there is not enough room in the command line.

A difference is made between four types of lines:

  buffer lines		The lines in the buffer.  This is the same as the
			lines as they are read from/written to a file.  They
			can be thousands of characters long.
  logical lines		The buffer lines with folding applied.  Buffer lines
			in a closed fold are changed to a single logical line:
			"+-- 99 lines folded".  They can be thousands of
			characters long.
  window lines		The lines displayed in a window: A range of logical
			lines with wrapping, line breaks, etc.  applied.  They
			can only be as long as the width of the window allows,
			longer lines are wrapped or truncated.
  screen lines		The lines of the screen that Vim uses.  Consists of
			the window lines of all windows, with status lines
			and the command line added.  They can only be as long
			as the width of the screen allows.  When the command
			line gets longer it wraps and lines are scrolled to
			make room.

==============================================================================
1. Key mapping				*key-mapping* *mapping* *macro*

Key mapping is used to change the meaning of typed keys.  The most common use
is to define a sequence commands for a function key.  Example: >

	:map <F2> a<C-R>=strftime("%c")<CR><Esc>

This appends the current date and time after the cursor (in <> notation |<>|).


1.1 MAP COMMANDS					*:map-commands*

There are commands to enter new mappings, remove mappings and list mappings.
See |map-overview| for the various forms of "map" and their relationships with
modes.

{lhs}	means left-hand-side	*{lhs}*
{rhs}	means right-hand-side	*{rhs}*

:map	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-nvo|		*:map*
:nm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-n|		*:nm* *:nmap*
:vm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-v|		*:vm* *:vmap*
:xm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-x|		*:xm* *:xmap*
:smap	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-s|		    *:smap*
:om[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-o|		*:om* *:omap*
:map!	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-ic|		*:map!*
:im[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-i|		*:im* *:imap*
:lm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-l|		*:lm* *:lmap*
:cm[ap]	{lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-c|		*:cm* *:cmap*
			Map the key sequence {lhs} to {rhs} for the modes
			where the map command applies.  The result, including
			{rhs}, is then further scanned for mappings.  This
			allows for nested and recursive use of mappings.

						*:nore* *:norem*
:no[remap]  {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-nvo|	*:no*  *:noremap* *:nor*
:nn[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-n|	*:nn*  *:nnoremap*
:vn[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-v|	*:vn*  *:vnoremap*
:xn[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-x|	*:xn*  *:xnoremap*
:snor[emap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-s|	*:snor* *:snoremap*
:ono[remap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-o|	*:ono* *:onoremap*
:no[remap]! {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-ic|	*:no!* *:noremap!*
:ino[remap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-i|	*:ino* *:inoremap*
:ln[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-l|	*:ln*  *:lnoremap*
:cno[remap] {lhs} {rhs}		|mapmode-c|	*:cno* *:cnoremap*
			Map the key sequence {lhs} to {rhs} for the modes
			where the map command applies.  Disallow mapping of
			{rhs}, to avoid nested and recursive mappings.  Often
			used to redefine a command.  {not in Vi}


:unm[ap]  {lhs}			|mapmode-nvo|		*:unm*  *:unmap*
:nun[map] {lhs}			|mapmode-n|		*:nun*  *:nunmap*
:vu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-v|		*:vu*   *:vunmap*
:xu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-x|		*:xu*   *:xunmap*
:sunm[ap] {lhs}			|mapmode-s|		*:sunm* *:sunmap*
:ou[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-o|		*:ou*   *:ounmap*
:unm[ap]! {lhs}			|mapmode-ic|		*:unm!* *:unmap!*
:iu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-i|		*:iu*   *:iunmap*
:lu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-l|		*:lu*   *:lunmap*
:cu[nmap] {lhs}			|mapmode-c|		*:cu*   *:cunmap*
			Remove the mapping of {lhs} for the modes where the
			map command applies.  The mapping may remain defined
			for other modes where it applies.
			Note: Trailing spaces are included in the {lhs}.  This
			unmap does NOT work: >
				:map @@ foo
				:unmap @@ | print

:mapc[lear]			|mapmode-nvo|		*:mapc*   *:mapclear*
:nmapc[lear]			|mapmode-n|		*:nmapc*  *:nmapclear*
:vmapc[lear]			|mapmode-v|		*:vmapc*  *:vmapclear*
:xmapc[lear]			|mapmode-x|		*:xmapc*  *:xmapclear*
:smapc[lear]			|mapmode-s|		*:smapc*  *:smapclear*
:omapc[lear]			|mapmode-o|		*:omapc*  *:omapclear*
:mapc[lear]!			|mapmode-ic|		*:mapc!*  *:mapclear!*
:imapc[lear]			|mapmode-i|		*:imapc*  *:imapclear*
:lmapc[lear]			|mapmode-l|		*:lmapc*  *:lmapclear*
:cmapc[lear]			|mapmode-c|		*:cmapc*  *:cmapclear*
			Remove ALL mappings for the modes where the map
			command applies.  {not in Vi}
			Use the <buffer> argument to remove buffer-local
			mappings |:map-<buffer>|
			Warning: This also removes the default mappings.

			List all key mappings for the modes where the map

These commands are used to map a key or key sequence to a string of
characters.  You can use this to put command sequences under function keys,
translate one key into another, etc.  See |:mkexrc| for how to save and
restore the current mappings.

							*map-ambiguous*
When two mappings start with the same sequence of characters, they are
ambiguous.  Example: >
	:imap aa foo
	:imap aaa bar
When Vim has read "aa", it will need to get another character to be able to
decide if "aa" or "aaa" should be mapped.  This means that after typing "aa"
that mapping won't get expanded yet, Vim is waiting for another character.
If you type a space, then "foo" will get inserted, plus the space.  If you
type "a", then "bar" will get inserted.
{Vi does not allow ambiguous mappings}


1.2 SPECIAL ARGUMENTS					*:map-arguments*

"<buffer>", "<nowait>", "<silent>", "<special>", "<script>", "<expr>" and
"<unique>" can be used in any order.  They must appear right after the
command, before any other arguments.

				*:map-local* *:map-<buffer>* *E224* *E225*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<buffer>" the mapping will
be effective in the current buffer only.  Example: >
	:map <buffer>  ,w  /[.,;]<CR>
Then you can map ",w" to something else in another buffer: >
	:map <buffer>  ,w  /[#&!]<CR>
The local buffer mappings are used before the global ones.  See <nowait> below
to make a short local mapping not taking effect when a longer global one
exists.
The "<buffer>" argument can also be used to clear mappings: >
	:unmap <buffer> ,w
	:mapclear <buffer>
Local mappings are also cleared when a buffer is deleted, but not when it is
unloaded.  Just like local option values.
Also see |map-precedence|.

						*:map-<nowait>* *:map-nowait*
When defining a buffer-local mapping for "," there may be a global mapping
that starts with ",".  Then you need to type another character for Vim to know
whether to use the "," mapping or the longer one.  To avoid this add the
<nowait> argument.  Then the mapping will be used when it matches, Vim does
not wait for more characters to be typed.  However, if the characters were
already type they are used.

						*:map-<silent>* *:map-silent*
To define a mapping which will not be echoed on the command line, add
"<silent>" as the first argument.  Example: >
	:map <silent> ,h /Header<CR>
The search string will not be echoed when using this mapping.  Messages from
the executed command are still given though.  To shut them up too, add a
":silent" in the executed command: >
	:map <silent> ,h :exe ":silent normal /Header\r"<CR>
Prompts will still be given, e.g., for inputdialog().
Using "<silent>" for an abbreviation is possible, but will cause redrawing of
the command line to fail.

						*:map-<special>* *:map-special*
Define a mapping with <> notation for special keys, even though the "<" flag
may appear in 'cpoptions'.  This is useful if the side effect of setting
'cpoptions' is not desired.  Example: >
	:map <special> <F12> /Header<CR>
<
						*:map-<script>* *:map-script*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<script>" and it is used to
define a new mapping or abbreviation, the mapping will only remap characters
in the {rhs} using mappings that were defined local to a script, starting with
"<SID>".  This can be used to avoid that mappings from outside a script
interfere (e.g., when CTRL-V is remapped in mswin.vim), but do use other
mappings defined in the script.
Note: ":map <script>" and ":noremap <script>" do the same thing.  The
"<script>" overrules the command name.  Using ":noremap <script>" is
preferred, because it's clearer that remapping is (mostly) disabled.

						*:map-<unique>* *E226* *E227*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<unique>" and it is used to
define a new mapping or abbreviation, the command will fail if the mapping or
abbreviation already exists.  Example: >
	:map <unique> ,w  /[#&!]<CR>
When defining a local mapping, there will also be a check if a global map
already exists which is equal.
Example of what will fail: >
	:map ,w  /[#&!]<CR>
	:map <buffer> <unique> ,w  /[.,;]<CR>
If you want to map a key and then have it do what it was originally mapped to,
have a look at |maparg()|.

						*:map-<expr>* *:map-expression*
If the first argument to one of these commands is "<expr>" and it is used to
define a new mapping or abbreviation, the argument is an expression.  The
expression is evaluated to obtain the {rhs} that is used.  Example: >
	:inoremap <expr> . InsertDot()
The result of the InsertDot() function will be inserted.  It could check the
text before the cursor and start omni completion when some condition is met.

For abbreviations |v:char| is set to the character that was typed to trigger
the abbreviation.  You can use this to decide how to expand the {lhs}.  You
should not either insert or change the v:char.

Be very careful about side effects!  The expression is evaluated while
obtaining characters, you may very well make the command dysfunctional.
For this reason the following is blocked:
- Changing the buffer text |textlock|.
- Editing another buffer.
- The |:normal| command.
- Moving the cursor is allowed, but it is restored afterwards.
If you want the mapping to do any of these let the returned characters do
that.

You can use getchar(), it consumes typeahead if there is any. E.g., if you
have these mappings: >
  inoremap <expr> <C-L> nr2char(getchar())
  inoremap <expr> <C-L>x "foo"
If you now type CTRL-L nothing happens yet, Vim needs the next character to
decide what mapping to use.  If you type 'x' the second mapping is used and
"foo" is inserted.  If you type any other key the first mapping is used,
getchar() gets the typed key and returns it.

Here is an example that inserts a list number that increases: >
	let counter = 0
	inoremap <expr> <C-L> ListItem()
	inoremap <expr> <C-R> ListReset()

	func ListItem()
	  let g:counter += 1
	  return g:counter . '. '
	endfunc

	func ListReset()
	  let g:counter = 0
	  return ''
	endfunc

CTRL-L inserts the next number, CTRL-R resets the count.  CTRL-R returns an
empty string, so that nothing is inserted.

Note that there are some tricks to make special keys work and escape CSI bytes
in the text.  The |:map| command also does this, thus you must avoid that it
is done twice.  This does not work: >
	:imap <expr> <F3> "<Char-0x611B>"
Because the <Char- sequence is escaped for being a |:imap| argument and then
again for using <expr>.  This does work: >
	:imap <expr> <F3> "\u611B"
Using 0x80 as a single byte before other text does not work, it will be seen
as a special key.


1.3 MAPPING AND MODES					*:map-modes*
			*mapmode-nvo* *mapmode-n* *mapmode-v* *mapmode-o*

There are six sets of mappings
- For Normal mode: When typing commands.
- For Visual mode: When typing commands while the Visual area is highlighted.
- For Select mode: like Visual mode but typing text replaces the selection.
- For Operator-pending mode: When an operator is pending (after "d", "y", "c",
  etc.).  See below: |omap-info|.
- For Insert mode.  These are also used in Replace mode.
- For Command-line mode: When entering a ":" or "/" command.

Special case: While typing a count for a command in Normal mode, mapping zero
is disabled.  This makes it possible to map zero without making it impossible
to type a count with a zero.

						*map-overview* *map-modes*
Overview of which map command works in which mode.  More details below.
     COMMANDS                    MODES ~
:map   :noremap  :unmap     Normal, Visual, Select, Operator-pending
:nmap  :nnoremap :nunmap    Normal
:vmap  :vnoremap :vunmap    Visual and Select
:smap  :snoremap :sunmap    Select
:xmap  :xnoremap :xunmap    Visual
:omap  :onoremap :ounmap    Operator-pending
:map!  :noremap! :unmap!    Insert and Command-line
:imap  :inoremap :iunmap    Insert
:lmap  :lnoremap :lunmap    Insert, Command-line, Lang-Arg
:cmap  :cnoremap :cunmap    Command-line


    COMMANDS				      MODES ~
				       Normal  Visual+Select  Operator-pending ~
:map   :noremap   :unmap   :mapclear	 yes	    yes		   yes
:nmap  :nnoremap  :nunmap  :nmapclear	 yes	     -		    -
:vmap  :vnoremap  :vunmap  :vmapclear	  -	    yes		    -
:omap  :onoremap  :ounmap  :omapclear	  -	     -		   yes

:nunmap can also be used outside of a monastery.
						*mapmode-x* *mapmode-s*
Some commands work both in Visual and Select mode, some in only one.  Note
that quite often "Visual" is mentioned where both Visual and Select mode
apply. |Select-mode-mapping|
NOTE: Mapping a printable character in Select mode may confuse the user.  It's
better to explicitly use :xmap and :smap for printable characters.  Or use
:sunmap after defining the mapping.

    COMMANDS				      MODES ~
					  Visual    Select ~
:vmap  :vnoremap  :vunmap  :vmapclear	    yes      yes
:xmap  :xnoremap  :xunmap  :xmapclear	    yes       -
:smap  :snoremap  :sunmap  :smapclear	    -	     yes

			*mapmode-ic* *mapmode-i* *mapmode-c* *mapmode-l*
Some commands work both in Insert mode and Command-line mode, some not:

    COMMANDS				      MODES ~
					  Insert  Command-line	Lang-Arg ~
:map!  :noremap!  :unmap!  :mapclear!	    yes	       yes	   -
:imap  :inoremap  :iunmap  :imapclear	    yes		-	   -
:cmap  :cnoremap  :cunmap  :cmapclear	     -	       yes	   -
:lmap  :lnoremap  :lunmap  :lmapclear	    yes*       yes*	  yes*

The original Vi did not have separate mappings for
Normal/Visual/Operator-pending mode and for Insert/Command-line mode.
Therefore the ":map" and ":map!" commands enter and display mappings for
several modes.  In Vim you can use the ":nmap", ":vmap", ":omap", ":cmap" and
":imap" commands to enter mappings for each mode separately.

							*omap-info*
Operator-pending mappings can be used to define a movement command that can be
used with any operator.  Simple example: ":omap { w" makes "y{" work like "yw"
and "d{" like "dw".

To ignore the starting cursor position and select different text, you can have
the omap start Visual mode to select the text to be operated upon.  Example
that operates on a function name in the current line: >
	onoremap <silent> F :<C-U>normal! 0f(hviw<CR>
The CTRL-U (<C-U>) is used to remove the range that Vim may insert.  The
Normal mode commands find the first '(' character and select the first word
before it.  That usually is the function name.

To enter a mapping for Normal and Visual mode, but not Operator-pending mode,
first define it for all three modes, then unmap it for Operator-pending mode:
	:map    xx something-difficult
	:ounmap xx
Likewise for a mapping for Visual and Operator-pending mode or Normal and
Operator-pending mode.

						*language-mapping*
":lmap" defines a mapping that applies to:
- Insert mode
- Command-line mode
- when entering a search pattern
- the argument of the commands that accept a text character, such as "r" and
  "f"
- for the input() line
Generally: Whenever a character is to be typed that is part of the text in the
buffer, not a Vim command character.  "Lang-Arg" isn't really another mode,
it's just used here for this situation.
   The simplest way to load a set of related language mappings is by using the
'keymap' option.  See |45.5|.
   In Insert mode and in Command-line mode the mappings can be disabled with
the CTRL-^ command |i_CTRL-^| |c_CTRL-^|. These commands change the value of
the 'iminsert' option.  When starting to enter a normal command line (not a
search pattern) the mappings are disabled until a CTRL-^ is typed.  The state
last used is remembered for Insert mode and Search patterns separately.  The
state for Insert mode is also used when typing a character as an argument to
command like "f" or "t".
   Language mappings will never be applied to already mapped characters.  They
are only used for typed characters.  This assumes that the language mapping
was already done when typing the mapping.


1.4 LISTING MAPPINGS					*map-listing*

When listing mappings the characters in the first two columns are:

      CHAR	MODE	~
     <Space>	Normal, Visual, Select and Operator-pending
	n	Normal
	v	Visual and Select
	s	Select
	x	Visual
	o	Operator-pending
	!	Insert and Command-line
	i	Insert
	l	":lmap" mappings for Insert, Command-line and Lang-Arg
	c	Command-line

Just before the {rhs} a special character can appear:
	*	indicates that it is not remappable
	&	indicates that only script-local mappings are remappable
	@	indicates a buffer-local mapping

Everything from the first non-blank after {lhs} up to the end of the line
(or '|') is considered to be part of {rhs}.  This allows the {rhs} to end
with a space.

Note: When using mappings for Visual mode, you can use the "'<" mark, which
is the start of the last selected Visual area in the current buffer |'<|.

The |:filter| command can be used to select what mappings to list.  The
pattern is matched against the {lhs} and {rhs} in the raw form.

							*:map-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing a key map will also display where it was
last defined.  Example: >

	:verbose map <C-W>*
	n  <C-W>*      * <C-W><C-S>*
		Last set from /home/abcd/.vimrc

See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.


1.5 MAPPING SPECIAL KEYS				*:map-special-keys*

There are three ways to map a special key:
1. The Vi-compatible method: Map the key code.  Often this is a sequence that
   starts with <Esc>.  To enter a mapping like this you type ":map " and then
   you have to type CTRL-V before hitting the function key.  Note that when
   the key code for the key is in the termcap (the t_ options), it will
   automatically be translated into the internal code and become the second
   way of mapping (unless the 'k' flag is included in 'cpoptions').
2. The second method is to use the internal code for the function key.  To
   enter such a mapping type CTRL-K and then hit the function key, or use
   the form "#1", "#2", .. "#9", "#0", "<Up>", "<S-Down>", "<S-F7>", etc.
   (see table of keys |key-notation|, all keys from <Up> can be used).  The
   first ten function keys can be defined in two ways: Just the number, like
   "#2", and with "<F>", like "<F2>".  Both stand for function key 2.  "#0"
   refers to function key 10, defined with option 't_f10', which may be
   function key zero on some keyboards.  The <> form cannot be used when
   'cpoptions' includes the '<' flag.
3. Use the termcap entry, with the form <t_xx>, where "xx" is the name of the
   termcap entry.  Any string entry can be used.  For example: >
     :map <t_F3> G
<  Maps function key 13 to "G".  This does not work if 'cpoptions' includes
   the '<' flag.

The advantage of the second and third method is that the mapping will work on
different terminals without modification (the function key will be
translated into the same internal code or the actual key code, no matter what
terminal you are using.  The termcap must be correct for this to work, and you
must use the same mappings).

DETAIL: Vim first checks if a sequence from the keyboard is mapped.  If it
isn't the terminal key codes are tried (see |terminal-options|).  If a
terminal code is found it is replaced with the internal code.  Then the check
for a mapping is done again (so you can map an internal code to something
else).  What is written into the script file depends on what is recognized.
If the terminal key code was recognized as a mapping the key code itself is
written to the script file.  If it was recognized as a terminal code the
internal code is written to the script file.


1.6 SPECIAL CHARACTERS					*:map-special-chars*
						*map_backslash* *map-backslash*
Note that only CTRL-V is mentioned here as a special character for mappings
and abbreviations.  When 'cpoptions' does not contain 'B', a backslash can
also be used like CTRL-V.  The <> notation can be fully used then |<>|.  But
you cannot use "<C-V>" like CTRL-V to escape the special meaning of what
follows.

To map a backslash, or use a backslash literally in the {rhs}, the special
sequence "<Bslash>" can be used.  This avoids the need to double backslashes
when using nested mappings.

						*map_CTRL-C* *map-CTRL-C*
Using CTRL-C in the {lhs} is possible, but it will only work when Vim is
waiting for a key, not when Vim is busy with something.  When Vim is busy
CTRL-C interrupts/breaks the command.
When using the GUI version on MS-Windows CTRL-C can be mapped to allow a Copy
command to the clipboard.  Use CTRL-Break to interrupt Vim.

					*map_space_in_lhs* *map-space_in_lhs*
To include a space in {lhs} precede it with a CTRL-V (type two CTRL-Vs for
each space).
					*map_space_in_rhs* *map-space_in_rhs*
If you want a {rhs} that starts with a space, use "<Space>".  To be fully Vi
compatible (but unreadable) don't use the |<>| notation, precede {rhs} with a
single CTRL-V (you have to type CTRL-V two times).
						*map_empty_rhs* *map-empty-rhs*
You can create an empty {rhs} by typing nothing after a single CTRL-V (you
have to type CTRL-V two times).  Unfortunately, you cannot do this in a vimrc
file.
							*<Nop>*
An easier way to get a mapping that doesn't produce anything, is to use
"<Nop>" for the {rhs}.  This only works when the |<>| notation is enabled.
For example, to make sure that function key 8 does nothing at all: >
	:map  <F8>  <Nop>
	:map! <F8>  <Nop>
<
							*map-multibyte*
It is possible to map multibyte characters, but only the whole character.  You
cannot map the first byte only.  This was done to prevent problems in this
scenario: >
	:set encoding=latin1
	:imap <M-C> foo
	:set encoding=utf-8
The mapping for <M-C> is defined with the latin1 encoding, resulting in a 0xc3
byte.  If you type the character  (0xe1 <M-a>) in UTF-8 encoding this is the
two bytes 0xc3 0xa1.  You don't want the 0xc3 byte to be mapped then or
otherwise it would be impossible to type the  character.

					*<Leader>* *mapleader*
To define a mapping which uses the "mapleader" variable, the special string
"<Leader>" can be used.  It is replaced with the string value of "mapleader".
If "mapleader" is not set or empty, a backslash is used instead.  Example: >
	:map <Leader>A  oanother line<Esc>
Works like: >
	:map \A  oanother line<Esc>
But after: >
	:let mapleader = ","
It works like: >
	:map ,A  oanother line<Esc>

Note that the value of "mapleader" is used at the moment the mapping is
defined.  Changing "mapleader" after that has no effect for already defined
mappings.

					*<LocalLeader>* *maplocalleader*
<LocalLeader> is just like <Leader>, except that it uses "maplocalleader"
instead of "mapleader".  <LocalLeader> is to be used for mappings which are
local to a buffer.  Example: >
      :map <buffer> <LocalLeader>A  oanother line<Esc>
<
In a global plugin <Leader> should be used and in a filetype plugin
<LocalLeader>.  "mapleader" and "maplocalleader" can be equal.  Although, if
you make them different, there is a smaller chance of mappings from global
plugins to clash with mappings for filetype plugins.  For example, you could
keep "mapleader" at the default backslash, and set "maplocalleader" to an
underscore.

							*map-<SID>*
In a script the special key name "<SID>" can be used to define a mapping
that's local to the script.  See |<SID>| for details.

							*<Plug>*
The special key name "<Plug>" can be used for an internal mapping, which is
not to be matched with any key sequence.  This is useful in plugins
|using-<Plug>|.

							*<Char>* *<Char->*
To map a character by its decimal, octal or hexadecimal number the <Char>
construct can be used:
	<Char-123>	character 123
	<Char-033>	character 27
	<Char-0x7f>	character 127
	<S-Char-114>    character 114 ('r') shifted ('R')
This is useful to specify a (multi-byte) character in a 'keymap' file.
Upper and lowercase differences are ignored.

							*map-comments*
It is not possible to put a comment after these commands, because the '"'
character is considered to be part of the {lhs} or {rhs}.

							*map_bar* *map-bar*
Since the '|' character is used to separate a map command from the next
command, you will have to do something special to include  a '|' in {rhs}.
There are three methods:
   use	     works when			   example	~
   <Bar>     '<' is not in 'cpoptions'	   :map _l :!ls <Bar> more^M
   \|	     'b' is not in 'cpoptions'	   :map _l :!ls \| more^M
   ^V|	     always, in Vim and Vi	   :map _l :!ls ^V| more^M

(here ^V stands for CTRL-V; to get one CTRL-V you have to type it twice; you
cannot use the <> notation "<C-V>" here).

All three work when you use the default setting for 'cpoptions'.

When 'b' is present in 'cpoptions', "\|" will be recognized as a mapping
ending in a '\' and then another command.  This is Vi compatible, but
illogical when compared to other commands.

						*map_return* *map-return*
When you have a mapping that contains an Ex command, you need to put a line
terminator after it to have it executed.  The use of <CR> is recommended for
this (see |<>|).  Example: >
   :map  _ls  :!ls -l %:S<CR>:echo "the end"<CR>

To avoid mapping of the characters you type in insert or Command-line mode,
type a CTRL-V first.  The mapping in Insert mode is disabled if the 'paste'
option is on.
							*map-error*
Note that when an error is encountered (that causes an error message or beep)
the rest of the mapping is not executed.  This is Vi-compatible.

Note that the second character (argument) of the commands @zZtTfF[]rm'`"v
and CTRL-X is not mapped.  This was done to be able to use all the named
registers and marks, even when the command with the same name has been
mapped.


1.7 WHAT KEYS TO MAP					*map-which-keys*

If you are going to map something, you will need to choose which key(s) to use
for the {lhs}.  You will have to avoid keys that are used for Vim commands,
otherwise you would not be able to use those commands anymore.  Here are a few
suggestions:
- Function keys <F2>, <F3>, etc..  Also the shifted function keys <S-F1>,
  <S-F2>, etc.  Note that <F1> is already used for the help command.
- Meta-keys (with the ALT key pressed).  Depending on your keyboard accented
  characters may be used as well. |:map-alt-keys|
- Use the '_' or ',' character and then any other character.  The "_" and ","
  commands do exist in Vim (see |_| and |,|), but you probably never use them.
- Use a key that is a synonym for another command.  For example: CTRL-P and
  CTRL-N.  Use an extra character to allow more mappings.
- The key defined by <Leader> and one or more other keys.  This is especially
  useful in scripts. |mapleader|

See the file "index" for keys that are not used and thus can be mapped without
losing any builtin function.  You can also use ":help {key}^D" to find out if
a key is used for some command.  ({key} is the specific key you want to find
out about, ^D is CTRL-D).


1.8 EXAMPLES						*map-examples*

A few examples (given as you type them, for "<CR>" you type four characters;
the '<' flag must not be present in 'cpoptions' for this to work). >

   :map <F3>  o#include
   :map <M-g> /foo<CR>cwbar<Esc>
   :map _x    d/END/e<CR>
   :map! qq   quadrillion questions


Multiplying a count

When you type a count before triggering a mapping, it's like the count was
typed before the {lhs}.  For example, with this mapping: >
   :map <F4>  3w
Typing 2<F4> will result in "23w". Thus not moving 2 * 3 words but 23 words.
If you want to multiply counts use the expression register: >
   :map <F4>  @='3w'<CR>
The part between quotes is the expression being executed. |@=|


1.9 USING MAPPINGS					*map-typing*

Vim will compare what you type with the start of a mapped sequence.  If there
is an incomplete match, it will get more characters until there either is a
complete match or until there is no match at all.  Example: If you map! "qq",
the first 'q' will not appear on the screen until you type another
character.  This is because Vim cannot know if the next character will be a
'q' or not.  If the 'timeout' option is on (which is the default) Vim will
only wait for one second (or as long as specified with the 'timeoutlen'
option).  After that it assumes that the 'q' is to be interpreted as such.  If
you type slowly, or your system is slow, reset the 'timeout' option.  Then you
might want to set the 'ttimeout' option.

                            				*map-precedence*
Buffer-local mappings (defined using |:map-<buffer>|) take precedence over
global mappings.  When a buffer-local mapping is the same as a global mapping,
Vim will use the buffer-local mapping.  In addition, Vim will use a complete
mapping immediately if it was defined with <nowait>, even if a longer mapping
has the same prefix.  For example, given the following two mappings: >
    :map <buffer> <nowait> \a   :echo "Local \a"<CR>
    :map                   \abc :echo "Global \abc"<CR>
When typing \a the buffer-local mapping will be used immediately.  Vim will
not wait for more characters to see if the user might be typing \abc.

							*map-keys-fails*
There are situations where key codes might not be recognized:
- Vim can only read part of the key code.  Mostly this is only the first
  character.  This happens on some Unix versions in an xterm.
- The key code is after character(s) that are mapped.  E.g., "<F1><F1>" or
  "g<F1>".

The result is that the key code is not recognized in this situation, and the
mapping fails.  There are two actions needed to avoid this problem:

- Remove the 'K' flag from 'cpoptions'.  This will make Vim wait for the rest
  of the characters of the function key.
- When using <F1> to <F4> the actual key code generated may correspond to
  <xF1> to <xF4>.  There are mappings from <xF1> to <F1>, <xF2> to <F2>, etc.,
  but these are not recognized after another half a mapping.  Make sure the
  key codes for <F1> to <F4> are correct: >
	:set <F1>=<type CTRL-V><type F1>
< Type the <F1> as four characters.  The part after the "=" must be done with
  the actual keys, not the literal text.
Another solution is to use the actual key code in the mapping for the second
special key: >
	:map <F1><Esc>OP :echo "yes"<CR>
Don't type a real <Esc>, Vim will recognize the key code and replace it with
<F1> anyway.

Another problem may be that when keeping ALT or Meta pressed the terminal
prepends ESC instead of setting the 8th bit.  See |:map-alt-keys|.

						*recursive_mapping*
If you include the {lhs} in the {rhs} you have a recursive mapping.  When
{lhs} is typed, it will be replaced with {rhs}.  When the {lhs} which is
included in {rhs} is encountered it will be replaced with {rhs}, and so on.
This makes it possible to repeat a command an infinite number of times.  The
only problem is that the only way to stop this is by causing an error.  The
macros to solve a maze uses this, look there for an example.  There is one
exception: If the {rhs} starts with {lhs}, the first character is not mapped
again (this is Vi compatible).
For example: >
   :map ab abcd
will execute the "a" command and insert "bcd" in the text.  The "ab" in the
{rhs} will not be mapped again.

If you want to exchange the meaning of two keys you should use the :noremap
command.  For example: >
   :noremap k j
   :noremap j k
This will exchange the cursor up and down commands.

With the normal :map command, when the 'remap' option is on, mapping takes
place until the text is found not to be a part of a {lhs}.  For example, if
you use: >
   :map x y
   :map y x
Vim will replace x with y, and then y with x, etc.  When this has happened
'maxmapdepth' times (default 1000), Vim will give the error message
"recursive mapping".

							*:map-undo*
If you include an undo command inside a mapped sequence, this will bring the
text back in the state before executing the macro.  This is compatible with
the original Vi, as long as there is only one undo command in the mapped
sequence (having two undo commands in a mapped sequence did not make sense
in the original Vi, you would get back the text before the first undo).


1.10 MAPPING ALT-KEYS					*:map-alt-keys*

In the GUI Vim handles the Alt key itself, thus mapping keys with ALT should
always work.  But in a terminal Vim gets a sequence of bytes and has to figure
out whether ALT was pressed or not.

By default Vim assumes that pressing the ALT key sets the 8th bit of a typed
character.  Most decent terminals can work that way, such as xterm, aterm and
rxvt.  If your <A-k> mappings don't work it might be that the terminal is
prefixing the character with an ESC character.  But you can just as well type
ESC before a character, thus Vim doesn't know what happened (except for
checking the delay between characters, which is not reliable).

As of this writing, some mainstream terminals like gnome-terminal and konsole
use the ESC prefix.  There doesn't appear a way to have them use the 8th bit
instead.  Xterm should work well by default.  Aterm and rxvt should work well
when started with the "--meta8" argument.  You can also tweak resources like
"metaSendsEscape", "eightBitInput" and "eightBitOutput".

On the Linux console, this behavior can be toggled with the "setmetamode"
command.  Bear in mind that not using an ESC prefix could get you in trouble
with other programs.  You should make sure that bash has the "convert-meta"
option set to "on" in order for your Meta keybindings to still work on it
(it's the default readline behavior, unless changed by specific system
configuration).  For that, you can add the line: >

	set convert-meta on

to your ~/.inputrc file. If you're creating the file, you might want to use: >

	$include /etc/inputrc

as the first line, if that file exists on your system, to keep global options.
This may cause a problem for entering special characters, such as the umlaut.
Then you should use CTRL-V before that character.

Bear in mind that convert-meta has been reported to have troubles when used in
UTF-8 locales.  On terminals like xterm, the "metaSendsEscape" resource can be
toggled on the fly through the "Main Options" menu, by pressing Ctrl-LeftClick
on the terminal; that's a good last resource in case you want to send ESC when
using other applications but not when inside VIM.


1.11 MAPPING AN OPERATOR				*:map-operator*

An operator is used before a {motion} command.  To define your own operator
you must create mapping that first sets the 'operatorfunc' option and then
invoke the |g@| operator.  After the user types the {motion} command the
specified function will be called.

							*g@* *E774* *E775*
g@{motion}		Call the function set by the 'operatorfunc' option.
			The '[ mark is positioned at the start of the text
			moved over by {motion}, the '] mark on the last
			character of the text.
			The function is called with one String argument:
			    "line"	{motion} was |linewise|
			    "char"	{motion} was |characterwise|
			    "block"	{motion} was |blockwise-visual|
			Although "block" would rarely appear, since it can
			only result from Visual mode where "g@" is not useful.
			{not available when compiled without the |+eval|
			feature}

Here is an example that counts the number of spaces with <F4>: >

	nmap <silent> <F4> :set opfunc=CountSpaces<CR>g@
	vmap <silent> <F4> :<C-U>call CountSpaces(visualmode(), 1)<CR>

	function! CountSpaces(type, ...)
	  let sel_save = &selection
	  let &selection = "inclusive"
	  let reg_save = @@

	  if a:0  " Invoked from Visual mode, use gv command.
	    silent exe "normal! gvy"
	  elseif a:type == 'line'
	    silent exe "normal! '[V']y"
	  else
	    silent exe "normal! `[v`]y"
	  endif

	  echomsg strlen(substitute(@@, '[^ ]', '', 'g'))

	  let &selection = sel_save
	  let @@ = reg_save
	endfunction

Note that the 'selection' option is temporarily set to "inclusive" to be able
to yank exactly the right text by using Visual mode from the '[ to the ']
mark.

Also note that there is a separate mapping for Visual mode.  It removes the
"'<,'>" range that ":" inserts in Visual mode and invokes the function with
visualmode() and an extra argument.

==============================================================================
2. Abbreviations			*abbreviations* *Abbreviations*

Abbreviations are used in Insert mode, Replace mode and Command-line mode.
If you enter a word that is an abbreviation, it is replaced with the word it
stands for.  This can be used to save typing for often used long words.  And
you can use it to automatically correct obvious spelling errors.
Examples:

	:iab ms Microsoft
	:iab tihs this

There are three types of abbreviations:

full-id	  The "full-id" type consists entirely of keyword characters (letters
	  and characters from 'iskeyword' option).  This is the most common
	  abbreviation.

	  Examples: "foo", "g3", "-1"

end-id	  The "end-id" type ends in a keyword character, but all the other
	  characters are not keyword characters.

	  Examples: "#i", "..f", "$/7"

non-id	  The "non-id" type ends in a non-keyword character, the other
	  characters may be of any type, excluding space and tab.  {this type
	  is not supported by Vi}

	  Examples: "def#", "4/7$"

Examples of strings that cannot be abbreviations: "a.b", "#def", "a b", "_$r"

An abbreviation is only recognized when you type a non-keyword character.
This can also be the <Esc> that ends insert mode or the <CR> that ends a
command.  The non-keyword character which ends the abbreviation is inserted
after the expanded abbreviation.  An exception to this is the character <C-]>,
which is used to expand an abbreviation without inserting any extra
characters.

Example: >
   :ab hh	hello
<	    "hh<Space>" is expanded to "hello<Space>"
	    "hh<C-]>" is expanded to "hello"

The characters before the cursor must match the abbreviation.  Each type has
an additional rule:

full-id	  In front of the match is a non-keyword character, or this is where
	  the line or insertion starts.  Exception: When the abbreviation is
	  only one character, it is not recognized if there is a non-keyword
	  character in front of it, other than a space or a tab.

end-id	  In front of the match is a keyword character, or a space or a tab,
	  or this is where the line or insertion starts.

non-id	  In front of the match is a space, tab or the start of the line or
	  the insertion.

Examples: ({CURSOR} is where you type a non-keyword character) >
   :ab foo   four old otters
<		" foo{CURSOR}"	  is expanded to " four old otters"
		" foobar{CURSOR}" is not expanded
		"barfoo{CURSOR}"  is not expanded
>
   :ab #i #include
<		"#i{CURSOR}"	  is expanded to "#include"
		">#i{CURSOR}"	  is not expanded
>
   :ab ;; <endofline>
<		"test;;"	  is not expanded
		"test ;;"	  is expanded to "test <endofline>"

To avoid the abbreviation in Insert mode: Type CTRL-V before the character
that would trigger the abbreviation.  E.g. CTRL-V <Space>.  Or type part of
the abbreviation, exit insert mode with <Esc>, re-enter insert mode with "a"
and type the rest.

To avoid the abbreviation in Command-line mode: Type CTRL-V twice somewhere in
the abbreviation to avoid it to be replaced.  A CTRL-V in front of a normal
character is mostly ignored otherwise.

It is possible to move the cursor after an abbreviation: >
   :iab if if ()<Left>
This does not work if 'cpoptions' includes the '<' flag. |<>|

You can even do more complicated things.  For example, to consume the space
typed after an abbreviation: >
   func Eatchar(pat)
      let c = nr2char(getchar(0))
      return (c =~ a:pat) ? '' : c
   endfunc
   iabbr <silent> if if ()<Left><C-R>=Eatchar('\s')<CR>

There are no default abbreviations.

Abbreviations are never recursive.  You can use ":ab f f-o-o" without any
problem.  But abbreviations can be mapped.  {some versions of Vi support
recursive abbreviations, for no apparent reason}

Abbreviations are disabled if the 'paste' option is on.

				*:abbreviate-local* *:abbreviate-<buffer>*
Just like mappings, abbreviations can be local to a buffer.  This is mostly
used in a |filetype-plugin| file.  Example for a C plugin file: >
	:abb <buffer> FF  for (i = 0; i < ; ++i)
<
						*:ab* *:abbreviate*
:ab[breviate]		list all abbreviations.  The character in the first
			column indicates the mode where the abbreviation is
			used: 'i' for insert mode, 'c' for Command-line
			mode, '!' for both.  These are the same as for
			mappings, see |map-listing|.

						*:abbreviate-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing an abbreviation will also display where it
was last defined.  Example: >

	:verbose abbreviate
	!  teh		 the
		Last set from /home/abcd/vim/abbr.vim

See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

:ab[breviate] {lhs}	list the abbreviations that start with {lhs}
			You may need to insert a CTRL-V (type it twice) to
			avoid that a typed {lhs} is expanded, since
			command-line abbreviations apply here.

:ab[breviate] [<expr>] [<buffer>] {lhs} {rhs}
			add abbreviation for {lhs} to {rhs}.  If {lhs} already
			existed it is replaced with the new {rhs}.  {rhs} may
			contain spaces.
			See |:map-<expr>| for the optional <expr> argument.
			See |:map-<buffer>| for the optional <buffer> argument.

						*:una* *:unabbreviate*
:una[bbreviate] {lhs}	Remove abbreviation for {lhs} from the list.  If none
			is found, remove abbreviations in which {lhs} matches
			with the {rhs}.  This is done so that you can even
			remove abbreviations after expansion.  To avoid
			expansion insert a CTRL-V (type it twice).

						*:norea* *:noreabbrev*
:norea[bbrev] [<expr>] [<buffer>] [lhs] [rhs]
			same as ":ab", but no remapping for this {rhs} {not
			in Vi}

						*:ca* *:cabbrev*
:ca[bbrev] [<expr>] [<buffer>] [lhs] [rhs]
			same as ":ab", but for Command-line mode only.  {not
			in Vi}

						*:cuna* *:cunabbrev*
:cuna[bbrev] {lhs}	same as ":una", but for Command-line mode only.  {not
			in Vi}

						*:cnorea* *:cnoreabbrev*
:cnorea[bbrev] [<expr>] [<buffer>] [lhs] [rhs]
			same as ":ab", but for Command-line mode only and no
			remapping for this {rhs} {not in Vi}

						*:ia* *:iabbrev*
:ia[bbrev] [<expr>] [<buffer>] [lhs] [rhs]
			same as ":ab", but for Insert mode only.  {not in Vi}

						*:iuna* *:iunabbrev*
:iuna[bbrev] {lhs}	same as ":una", but for insert mode only.  {not in
			Vi}

						*:inorea* *:inoreabbrev*
:inorea[bbrev] [<expr>] [<buffer>] [lhs] [rhs]
			same as ":ab", but for Insert mode only and no
			remapping for this {rhs} {not in Vi}

							*:abc* *:abclear*
:abc[lear] [<buffer>]	Remove all abbreviations.  {not in Vi}

							*:iabc* *:iabclear*
:iabc[lear] [<buffer>]	Remove all abbreviations for Insert mode.  {not in Vi}

							*:cabc* *:cabclear*
:cabc[lear] [<buffer>]	Remove all abbreviations for Command-line mode.  {not
			in Vi}

							*using_CTRL-V*
It is possible to use special characters in the rhs of an abbreviation.
CTRL-V has to be used to avoid the special meaning of most non printable
characters.  How many CTRL-Vs need to be typed depends on how you enter the
abbreviation.  This also applies to mappings.  Let's use an example here.

Suppose you want to abbreviate "esc" to enter an <Esc> character.  When you
type the ":ab" command in Vim, you have to enter this: (here ^V is a CTRL-V
and ^[ is <Esc>)

You type:   ab esc ^V^V^V^V^V^[

	All keyboard input is subjected to ^V quote interpretation, so
	the first, third, and fifth ^V  characters simply allow the second,
	and fourth ^Vs, and the ^[, to be entered into the command-line.

You see:    ab esc ^V^V^[

	The command-line contains two actual ^Vs before the ^[.  This is
	how it should appear in your .exrc file, if you choose to go that
	route.  The first ^V is there to quote the second ^V; the :ab
	command uses ^V as its own quote character, so you can include quoted
	whitespace or the | character in the abbreviation.  The :ab command
	doesn't do anything special with the ^[ character, so it doesn't need
	to be quoted.  (Although quoting isn't harmful; that's why typing 7
	[but not 8!] ^Vs works.)

Stored as:  esc     ^V^[

	After parsing, the abbreviation's short form ("esc") and long form
	(the two characters "^V^[") are stored in the abbreviation table.
	If you give the :ab command with no arguments, this is how the
	abbreviation will be displayed.

	Later, when the abbreviation is expanded because the user typed in
	the word "esc", the long form is subjected to the same type of
	^V interpretation as keyboard input.  So the ^V protects the ^[
	character from being interpreted as the "exit Insert mode" character.
	Instead, the ^[ is inserted into the text.

Expands to: ^[

[example given by Steve Kirkendall]

==============================================================================
3. Local mappings and functions				*script-local*

When using several Vim script files, there is the danger that mappings and
functions used in one script use the same name as in other scripts.  To avoid
this, they can be made local to the script.

						*<SID>* *<SNR>* *E81*
The string "<SID>" can be used in a mapping or menu.  This requires that the
'<' flag is not present in 'cpoptions'.
   When executing the map command, Vim will replace "<SID>" with the special
key code <SNR>, followed by a number that's unique for the script, and an
underscore.  Example: >
	:map <SID>Add
could define a mapping "<SNR>23_Add".

When defining a function in a script, "s:" can be prepended to the name to
make it local to the script.  But when a mapping is executed from outside of
the script, it doesn't know in which script the function was defined.  To
avoid this problem, use "<SID>" instead of "s:".  The same translation is done
as for mappings.  This makes it possible to define a call to the function in
a mapping.

When a local function is executed, it runs in the context of the script it was
defined in.  This means that new functions and mappings it defines can also
use "s:" or "<SID>" and it will use the same unique number as when the
function itself was defined.  Also, the "s:var" local script variables can be
used.

When executing an autocommand or a user command, it will run in the context of
the script it was defined in.  This makes it possible that the command calls a
local function or uses a local mapping.

Otherwise, using "<SID>" outside of a script context is an error.

If you need to get the script number to use in a complicated script, you can
use this function: >
	function s:SID()
	  return matchstr(expand('<sfile>'), '<SNR>\zs\d\+\ze_SID$')
	endfun

The "<SNR>" will be shown when listing functions and mappings.  This is useful
to find out what they are defined to.

The |:scriptnames| command can be used to see which scripts have been sourced
and what their <SNR> number is.

This is all {not in Vi} and {not available when compiled without the |+eval|
feature}.

==============================================================================
4. User-defined commands				*user-commands*

It is possible to define your own Ex commands.  A user-defined command can act
just like a built-in command (it can have a range or arguments, arguments can
be completed as filenames or buffer names, etc), except that when the command
is executed, it is transformed into a normal Ex command and then executed.

For starters: See section |40.2| in the user manual.

					*E183* *E841* *user-cmd-ambiguous*
All user defined commands must start with an uppercase letter, to avoid
confusion with builtin commands.  Exceptions are these builtin commands:
	:Next
	:X
They cannot be used for a user defined command.  ":Print" is also an existing
command, but it is deprecated and can be overruled.

The other characters of the user command can be uppercase letters, lowercase
letters or digits.  When using digits, note that other commands that take a
numeric argument may become ambiguous.  For example, the command ":Cc2" could
be the user command ":Cc2" without an argument, or the command ":Cc" with
argument "2".  It is advised to put a space between the command name and the
argument to avoid these problems.

When using a user-defined command, the command can be abbreviated.  However, if
an abbreviation is not unique, an error will be issued.  Furthermore, a
built-in command will always take precedence.

Example: >
	:command Rename ...
	:command Renumber ...
	:Rena				" Means "Rename"
	:Renu				" Means "Renumber"
	:Ren				" Error - ambiguous
	:command Paste ...
	:P				" The built-in :Print

It is recommended that full names for user-defined commands are used in
scripts.

:com[mand]						*:com* *:command*
			List all user-defined commands.  When listing commands,
			the characters in the first two columns are
			    !	Command has the -bang attribute
			    "	Command has the -register attribute
			    b	Command is local to current buffer
			(see below for details on attributes)
			The list can be filtered on command name with
			|:filter|, e.g., to list all commands with "Pyth" in
			the name: >
				filter Pyth command

:com[mand] {cmd}	List the user-defined commands that start with {cmd}

							*:command-verbose*
When 'verbose' is non-zero, listing a command will also display where it was
last defined. Example: >

    :verbose command TOhtml
<	Name	    Args Range Complete  Definition ~
	TOhtml	    0	 %		 :call Convert2HTML(<line1>, <line2>) ~
	    Last set from /usr/share/vim/vim-7.0/plugin/tohtml.vim ~

See |:verbose-cmd| for more information.

							*E174* *E182*
:com[mand][!] [{attr}...] {cmd} {rep}
			Define a user command.  The name of the command is
			{cmd} and its replacement text is {rep}.  The command's
			attributes (see below) are {attr}.  If the command
			already exists, an error is reported, unless a ! is
			specified, in which case the command is redefined.

:delc[ommand] {cmd}				*:delc* *:delcommand* *E184*
			Delete the user-defined command {cmd}.

:comc[lear]						*:comc* *:comclear*
			Delete all user-defined commands.

Command attributes

User-defined commands are treated by Vim just like any other Ex commands.  They
can have arguments, or have a range specified.  Arguments are subject to
completion as filenames, buffers, etc.  Exactly how this works depends upon the
command's attributes, which are specified when the command is defined.

There are a number of attributes, split into four categories: argument
handling, completion behavior, range handling, and special cases.  The
attributes are described below, by category.

Argument handling				*E175* *E176* *:command-nargs*

By default, a user defined command will take no arguments (and an error is
reported if any are supplied).  However, it is possible to specify that the
command can take arguments, using the -nargs attribute.  Valid cases are:

	-nargs=0    No arguments are allowed (the default)
	-nargs=1    Exactly one argument is required, it includes spaces 
	-nargs=*    Any number of arguments are allowed (0, 1, or many),
		    separated by white space
	-nargs=?    0 or 1 arguments are allowed
	-nargs=+    Arguments must be supplied, but any number are allowed

Arguments are considered to be separated by (unescaped) spaces or tabs in this
context, except when there is one argument, then the white space is part of
the argument.

Note that arguments are used as text, not as expressions.  Specifically,
"s:var" will use the script-local variable in the script where the command was
defined, not where it is invoked!  Example:
    script1.vim: >
	:let s:error = "None"
	:command -nargs=1 Error echoerr <args>
<   script2.vim: >
	:source script1.vim
	:let s:error = "Wrong!"
	:Error s:error
Executing script2.vim will result in "None" being echoed.  Not what you
intended!  Calling a function may be an alternative.

Completion behavior				*:command-completion* *E179*
					*E180* *E181* *:command-complete*
By default, the arguments of user defined commands do not undergo completion.
However, by specifying one or the other of the following attributes, argument
completion can be enabled:

	-complete=augroup	autocmd groups
	-complete=buffer	buffer names
	-complete=behave	:behave suboptions
	-complete=color		color schemes
	-complete=command	Ex command (and arguments)
	-complete=compiler	compilers
	-complete=cscope	|:cscope| suboptions
	-complete=dir		directory names
	-complete=environment	environment variable names
	-complete=event		autocommand events
	-complete=expression	Vim expression
	-complete=file		file and directory names
	-complete=file_in_path	file and directory names in |'path'|
	-complete=filetype	filetype names |'filetype'|
	-complete=function	function name
	-complete=help		help subjects
	-complete=highlight	highlight groups
	-complete=history	:history suboptions
	-complete=locale	locale names (as output of locale -a)
	-complete=mapping	mapping name
	-complete=menu		menus
	-complete=messages	|:messages| suboptions
	-complete=option	options
	-complete=packadd	optional package |pack-add| names
	-complete=shellcmd	Shell command
	-complete=sign		|:sign| suboptions
	-complete=syntax	syntax file names |'syntax'|
	-complete=syntime	|:syntime| suboptions
	-complete=tag		tags
	-complete=tag_listfiles	tags, file names are shown when CTRL-D is hit
	-complete=user		user names
	-complete=var		user variables
	-complete=custom,{func} custom completion, defined via {func}
	-complete=customlist,{func} custom completion, defined via {func}

Note: That some completion methods might expand environment variables.


Custom completion			*:command-completion-custom*
					*:command-completion-customlist*
					*E467* *E468*
It is possible to define customized completion schemes via the "custom,{func}"
or the "customlist,{func}" completion argument.  The {func} part should be a
function with the following signature: >

	:function {func}(ArgLead, CmdLine, CursorPos)

The function need not use all these arguments. The function should provide the
completion candidates as the return value.

For the "custom" argument, the function should return the completion
candidates one per line in a newline separated string.

For the "customlist" argument, the function should return the completion
candidates as a Vim List.  Non-string items in the list are ignored.

The function arguments are:
	ArgLead		the leading portion of the argument currently being
			completed on
	CmdLine		the entire command line
	CursorPos	the cursor position in it (byte index)
The function may use these for determining context.  For the "custom"
argument, it is not necessary to filter candidates against the (implicit
pattern in) ArgLead.  Vim will filter the candidates with its regexp engine
after function return, and this is probably more efficient in most cases. For
the "customlist" argument, Vim will not filter the returned completion
candidates and the user supplied function should filter the candidates.

The following example lists user names to a Finger command >
    :com -complete=custom,ListUsers -nargs=1 Finger !finger <args>
    :fun ListUsers(A,L,P)
    :    return system("cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd")
    :endfun

The following example completes filenames from the directories specified in
the 'path' option: >
    :com -nargs=1 -bang -complete=customlist,EditFileComplete
			\ EditFile edit<bang> <args>

Range handling				*E177* *E178* *:command-range*
							*:command-count*
By default, user-defined commands do not accept a line number range.  However,
it is possible to specify that the command does take a range (the -range
attribute), or that it takes an arbitrary count value, either in the line
number position (-range=N, like the |:split| command) or as a "count"
argument (-count=N, like the |:Next| command).  The count will then be
available in the argument with |<count>|.

Possible attributes are:

	-range	    Range allowed, default is current line
	-range=%    Range allowed, default is whole file (1,$)
	-range=N    A count (default N) which is specified in the line
		    number position (like |:split|); allows for zero line
		    number.
	-count=N    A count (default N) which is specified either in the line
		    number position, or as an initial argument (like |:Next|).
		    Specifying -count (without a default) acts like -count=0

Note that -range=N and -count=N are mutually exclusive - only one should be
specified.

					*:command-addr*
It is possible that the special characters in the range like ., $ or % which
by default correspond to the current line, last line and the whole buffer,
relate to arguments, (loaded) buffers, windows or tab pages.

Possible values are:
	-addr=lines		Range of lines (this is the default)
	-addr=arguments		Range for arguments
	-addr=buffers		Range for buffers (also not loaded buffers)
	-addr=loaded_buffers	Range for loaded buffers
	-addr=windows		Range for windows
	-addr=tabs		Range for tab pages

Special cases				*:command-bang* *:command-bar*
					*:command-register* *:command-buffer*
There are some special cases as well:

	-bang	    The command can take a ! modifier (like :q or :w)
	-bar	    The command can be followed by a "|" and another command.
		    A "|" inside the command argument is not allowed then.
		    Also checks for a " to start a comment.
	-register   The first argument to the command can be an optional
		    register name (like :del, :put, :yank).
	-buffer	    The command will only be available in the current buffer.

In the cases of the -count and -register attributes, if the optional argument
is supplied, it is removed from the argument list and is available to the
replacement text separately.
Note that these arguments can be abbreviated, but that is a deprecated
feature.  Use the full name for new scripts.

Replacement text

The replacement text for a user defined command is scanned for special escape
sequences, using <...> notation.  Escape sequences are replaced with values
from the entered command line, and all other text is copied unchanged.  The
resulting string is executed as an Ex command.  To avoid the replacement use
<lt> in place of the initial <.  Thus to include "<bang>" literally use
"<lt>bang>".

The valid escape sequences are

						*<line1>*
	<line1>	The starting line of the command range.
						*<line2>*
	<line2>	The final line of the command range.
						*<count>*
	<count>	Any count supplied (as described for the '-range'
		and '-count' attributes).
						*<bang>*
	<bang>	(See the '-bang' attribute) Expands to a ! if the
		command was executed with a ! modifier, otherwise
		expands to nothing.
						*<mods>*
	<mods>  The command modifiers, if specified. Otherwise, expands to
		nothing. Supported modifiers are |:aboveleft|, |:belowright|,
		|:botright|, |:browse|, |:confirm|, |:hide|, |:keepalt|,
		|:keepjumps|, |:keepmarks|, |:keeppatterns|, |:leftabove|,
		|:lockmarks|, |:noswapfile| |:rightbelow|, |:silent|, |:tab|,
		|:topleft|, |:verbose|, and |:vertical|.
		Note that these are not yet supported: |:noautocmd|,
		|:sandbox| and |:unsilent|.
		Examples: >
		    command! -nargs=+ -complete=file MyEdit
				\ for f in expand(<q-args>, 0, 1) |
				\ exe '<mods> split ' . f |
				\ endfor

		    function! SpecialEdit(files, mods)
			for f in expand(a:files, 0, 1)
			    exe a:mods . ' split ' . f
			endfor
		    endfunction
		    command! -nargs=+ -complete=file Sedit
				\ call SpecialEdit(<q-args>, <q-mods>)
<
						*<reg>* *<register>*
	<reg>	(See the '-register' attribute) The optional register,
		if specified.  Otherwise, expands to nothing.  <register>
		is a synonym for this.
						*<args>*
	<args>	The command arguments, exactly as supplied (but as
		noted above, any count or register can consume some
		of the arguments, which are then not part of <args>).
	<lt>	A single '<' (Less-Than) character.  This is needed if you
		want to get a literal copy of one of these escape sequences
		into the expansion - for example, to get <bang>, use
		<lt>bang>.

							*<q-args>*
If the first two characters of an escape sequence are "q-" (for example,
<q-args>) then the value is quoted in such a way as to make it a valid value
for use in an expression.  This uses the argument as one single value.
When there is no argument <q-args> is an empty string.
							*<f-args>*
To allow commands to pass their arguments on to a user-defined function, there
is a special form <f-args> ("function args").  This splits the command
arguments at spaces and tabs, quotes each argument individually, and the
<f-args> sequence is replaced by the comma-separated list of quoted arguments.
See the Mycmd example below.  If no arguments are given <f-args> is removed.
   To embed whitespace into an argument of <f-args>, prepend a backslash.
<f-args> replaces every pair of backslashes (\\) with one backslash.  A
backslash followed by a character other than white space or a backslash
remains unmodified.  Overview:

	command		   <f-args> ~
	XX ab		   'ab'
	XX a\b		   'a\b'
	XX a\ b		   'a b'
	XX a\  b	   'a ', 'b'
	XX a\\b		   'a\b'
	XX a\\ b	   'a\', 'b'
	XX a\\\b	   'a\\b'
	XX a\\\ b	   'a\ b'
	XX a\\\\b	   'a\\b'
	XX a\\\\ b	   'a\\', 'b'

Examples >

   " Delete everything after here to the end
   :com Ddel +,$d

   " Rename the current buffer
   :com -nargs=1 -bang -complete=file Ren f <args>|w<bang>

   " Call a user function (example of <f-args>)

When executed as: >
	:Mycmd arg1 arg2
This will invoke: >
	:call Myfunc("arg1","arg2")

   :" A more substantial example
   :function Allargs(command)
   :   let i = 0
   :   while i < argc()
   :	  if filereadable(argv(i))
   :	     execute "e " . argv(i)
   :	     execute a:command
   :      endif
   :      let i = i + 1
   :   endwhile
   :endfunction
   :command -nargs=+ -complete=command Allargs call Allargs(<q-args>)

The command Allargs takes any Vim command(s) as argument and executes it on all
files in the argument list.  Usage example (note use of the "e" flag to ignore
errors and the "update" command to write modified buffers): >
	:Allargs %s/foo/bar/ge|update
This will invoke: >
	:call Allargs("%s/foo/bar/ge|update")
<
When defining a user command in a script, it will be able to call functions
local to the script and use mappings local to the script.  When the user
invokes the user command, it will run in the context of the script it was
defined in.  This matters if |<SID>| is used in a command.

==============================================================================
1. Getting started					*mbyte-first*

This is a summary of the multibyte features in Vim.  If you are lucky it works
as described and you can start using Vim without much trouble.  If something
doesn't work you will have to read the rest.  Don't be surprised if it takes
quite a bit of work and experimenting to make Vim use all the multi-byte
features.  Unfortunately, every system has its own way to deal with multibyte
languages and it is quite complicated.


COMPILING

If you already have a compiled Vim program, check if the |+multi_byte| feature
is included.  The |:version| command can be used for this.

If +multi_byte is not included, you should compile Vim with "normal", "big" or
"huge" features.  You can further tune what features are included.  See the
INSTALL files in the source directory.


LOCALE

First of all, you must make sure your current locale is set correctly.  If
your system has been installed to use the language, it probably works right
away.  If not, you can often make it work by setting the $LANG environment
variable in your shell: >

	setenv LANG ja_JP.EUC

Unfortunately, the name of the locale depends on your system.  Japanese might
also be called "ja_JP.EUCjp" or just "ja".  To see what is currently used: >

	:language

To change the locale inside Vim use: >

	:language ja_JP.EUC

Vim will give an error message if this doesn't work.  This is a good way to
experiment and find the locale name you want to use.  But it's always better
to set the locale in the shell, so that it is used right from the start.

See |mbyte-locale| for details.


ENCODING

If your locale works properly, Vim will try to set the 'encoding' option
accordingly.  If this doesn't work you can overrule its value: >

	:set encoding=utf-8

See |encoding-values| for a list of acceptable values.

The result is that all the text that is used inside Vim will be in this
encoding.  Not only the text in the buffers, but also in registers, variables,
etc.  This also means that changing the value of 'encoding' makes the existing
text invalid!  The text doesn't change, but it will be displayed wrong.

You can edit files in another encoding than what 'encoding' is set to.  Vim
will convert the file when you read it and convert it back when you write it.
See 'fileencoding', 'fileencodings' and |++enc|.


DISPLAY AND FONTS

If you are working in a terminal (emulator) you must make sure it accepts the
same encoding as which Vim is working with.  If this is not the case, you can
use the 'termencoding' option to make Vim convert text automatically.

For the GUI you must select fonts that work with the current 'encoding'.  This
is the difficult part.  It depends on the system you are using, the locale and
a few other things.  See the chapters on fonts: |mbyte-fonts-X11| for
X-Windows and |mbyte-fonts-MSwin| for MS-Windows.

For GTK+ 2, you can skip most of this section.  The option 'guifontset' does
no longer exist.  You only need to set 'guifont' and everything should "just
work".  If your system comes with Xft2 and fontconfig and the current font
does not contain a certain glyph, a different font will be used automatically
if available.  The 'guifontwide' option is still supported but usually you do
not need to set it.  It is only necessary if the automatic font selection does
not suit your needs.

For X11 you can set the 'guifontset' option to a list of fonts that together
cover the characters that are used.  Example for Korean: >

	:set guifontset=k12,r12

Alternatively, you can set 'guifont' and 'guifontwide'.  'guifont' is used for
the single-width characters, 'guifontwide' for the double-width characters.
Thus the 'guifontwide' font must be exactly twice as wide as 'guifont'.
Example for UTF-8: >

	:set guifont=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-18-120-100-100-c-90-iso10646-1
	:set guifontwide=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-18-120-100-100-c-180-iso10646-1

You can also set 'guifont' alone, Vim will try to find a matching
'guifontwide' for you.


INPUT

There are several ways to enter multi-byte characters:
- For X11 XIM can be used.  See |XIM|.
- For MS-Windows IME can be used.  See |IME|.
- For all systems keymaps can be used.  See |mbyte-keymap|.

The options 'iminsert', 'imsearch' and 'imcmdline' can be used to chose
the different input methods or disable them temporarily.

==============================================================================
2.  Locale						*mbyte-locale*

The easiest setup is when your whole system uses the locale you want to work
in.  But it's also possible to set the locale for one shell you are working
in, or just use a certain locale inside Vim.


WHAT IS A LOCALE?					*locale*

There are many of languages in the world.  And there are different cultures
and environments at least as much as the number of languages.	A linguistic
environment corresponding to an area is called "locale".  This includes
information about the used language, the charset, collating order for sorting,
date format, currency format and so on.  For Vim only the language and charset
really matter.

You can only use a locale if your system has support for it.  Some systems
have only a few locales, especially in the USA.  The language which you want
to use may not be on your system.  In that case you might be able to install
it as an extra package.  Check your system documentation for how to do that.

The location in which the locales are installed varies from system to system.
For example, "/usr/share/locale" or "/usr/lib/locale".  See your system's
setlocale() man page.

Looking in these directories will show you the exact name of each locale.
Mostly upper/lowercase matters, thus "ja_JP.EUC" and "ja_jp.euc" are
different.  Some systems have a locale.alias file, which allows translation
from a short name like "nl" to the full name "nl_NL.ISO_8859-1".

Note that X-windows has its own locale stuff.  And unfortunately uses locale
names different from what is used elsewhere.  This is confusing!  For Vim it
matters what the setlocale() function uses, which is generally NOT the
X-windows stuff.  You might have to do some experiments to find out what
really works.

							*locale-name*
The (simplified) format of |locale| name is:

	language
or	language_territory
or	language_territory.codeset

Territory means the country (or part of it), codeset means the |charset|.  For
example, the locale name "ja_JP.eucJP" means:
	ja	the language is Japanese
	JP	the country is Japan
	eucJP	the codeset is EUC-JP
But it also could be "ja", "ja_JP.EUC", "ja_JP.ujis", etc.  And unfortunately,
the locale name for a specific language, territory and codeset is not unified
and depends on your system.

Examples of locale name:
    charset	    language		  locale name ~
    GB2312	    Chinese (simplified)  zh_CN.EUC, zh_CN.GB2312
    Big5	    Chinese (traditional) zh_TW.BIG5, zh_TW.Big5
    CNS-11643	    Chinese (traditional) zh_TW
    EUC-JP	    Japanese		  ja, ja_JP.EUC, ja_JP.ujis, ja_JP.eucJP
    Shift_JIS	    Japanese		  ja_JP.SJIS, ja_JP.Shift_JIS
    EUC-KR	    Korean		  ko, ko_KR.EUC


USING A LOCALE

To start using a locale for the whole system, see the documentation of your
system.  Mostly you need to set it in a configuration file in "/etc".

To use a locale in a shell, set the $LANG environment value.  When you want to
use Korean and the |locale| name is "ko", do this:

    sh:    export LANG=ko
    csh:   setenv LANG ko

You can put this in your ~/.profile or ~/.cshrc file to always use it.

To use a locale in Vim only, use the |:language| command: >

	:language ko

Put this in your ~/.vimrc file to use it always.

Or specify $LANG when starting Vim:

   sh:    LANG=ko vim {vim-arguments}
   csh:	  env LANG=ko vim {vim-arguments}

You could make a small shell script for this.

==============================================================================
3.  Encoding				*mbyte-encoding*

Vim uses the 'encoding' option to specify how characters are identified and
encoded when they are used inside Vim.  This applies to all the places where
text is used, including buffers (files loaded into memory), registers and
variables.

							*charset* *codeset*
Charset is another name for encoding.  There are subtle differences, but these
don't matter when using Vim.  "codeset" is another similar name.

Each character is encoded as one or more bytes.  When all characters are
encoded with one byte, we call this a single-byte encoding.  The most often
used one is called "latin1".  This limits the number of characters to 256.
Some of these are control characters, thus even fewer can be used for text.

When some characters use two or more bytes, we call this a multi-byte
encoding.  This allows using much more than 256 characters, which is required
for most East Asian languages.

Most multi-byte encodings use one byte for the first 127 characters.  These
are equal to ASCII, which makes it easy to exchange plain-ASCII text, no
matter what language is used.  Thus you might see the right text even when the
encoding was set wrong.

							*encoding-names*
Vim can use many different character encodings.  There are three major groups:

1   8bit	Single-byte encodings, 256 different characters.  Mostly used
		in USA and Europe.  Example: ISO-8859-1 (Latin1).  All
		characters occupy one screen cell only.

2   2byte	Double-byte encodings, over 10000 different characters.
		Mostly used in Asian countries.  Example: euc-kr (Korean)
		The number of screen cells is equal to the number of bytes
		(except for euc-jp when the first byte is 0x8e).

u   Unicode	Universal encoding, can replace all others.  ISO 10646.
		Millions of different characters.  Example: UTF-8.  The
		relation between bytes and screen cells is complex.

Other encodings cannot be used by Vim internally.  But files in other
encodings can be edited by using conversion, see 'fileencoding'.
Note that all encodings must use ASCII for the characters up to 128 (except
when compiled for EBCDIC).

Supported 'encoding' values are:			*encoding-values*
1   latin1	8-bit characters (ISO 8859-1, also used for cp1252)
1   iso-8859-n	ISO_8859 variant (n = 2 to 15)
1   koi8-r	Russian
1   koi8-u	Ukrainian
1   macroman    MacRoman (Macintosh encoding)
1   8bit-{name} any 8-bit encoding (Vim specific name)
1   cp437	similar to iso-8859-1
1   cp737	similar to iso-8859-7
1   cp775	Baltic
1   cp850	similar to iso-8859-4

2   cp949	Korean (Unix and Windows)
2   euc-kr	Korean (Unix only)
2   cp936	simplified Chinese (Windows only)
2   euc-cn	simplified Chinese (Unix only)
2   cp950	traditional Chinese (on Unix alias for big5)
2   big5	traditional Chinese (on Windows alias for cp950)
2   euc-tw	traditional Chinese (Unix only)
2   2byte-{name} Unix: any double-byte encoding (Vim specific name)
2   cp{number}	MS-Windows: any installed double-byte codepage
u   utf-8	32 bit UTF-8 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-2	16 bit UCS-2 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-2le	like ucs-2, little endian
u   utf-16	ucs-2 extended with double-words for more characters
u   utf-16le	like utf-16, little endian
u   ucs-4	32 bit UCS-4 encoded Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
u   ucs-4le	like ucs-4, little endian

The {name} can be any encoding name that your system supports.  It is passed
to iconv() to convert between the encoding of the file and the current locale.
For MS-Windows "cp{number}" means using codepage {number}.
Examples: >
		:set encoding=8bit-cp1252
		:set encoding=2byte-cp932

The MS-Windows codepage 1252 is very similar to latin1.  For practical reasons
the same encoding is used and it's called latin1.  'isprint' can be used to
display the characters 0x80 - 0xA0 or not.

Several aliases can be used, they are translated to one of the names above.
An incomplete list:

1   ansi	same as latin1 (obsolete, for backward compatibility)
2   japan	Japanese: on Unix "euc-jp", on MS-Windows cp932
2   korea	Korean: on Unix "euc-kr", on MS-Windows cp949
2   prc		simplified Chinese: on Unix "euc-cn", on MS-Windows cp936
2   chinese     same as "prc"
2   taiwan	traditional Chinese: on Unix "euc-tw", on MS-Windows cp950
u   utf8	same as utf-8
u   unicode	same as ucs-2
u   ucs2be	same as ucs-2 (big endian)
u   ucs-2be	same as ucs-2 (big endian)
u   ucs-4be	same as ucs-4 (big endian)
u   utf-32	same as ucs-4
u   utf-32le	same as ucs-4le
    default     stands for the default value of 'encoding', depends on the
		environment

For the UCS codes the byte order matters.  This is tricky, use UTF-8 whenever
you can.  The default is to use big-endian (most significant byte comes
first):
	    name	bytes		char ~
	    ucs-2	      11 22	    1122
	    ucs-2le	      22 11	    1122
	    ucs-4	11 22 33 44	11223344
	    ucs-4le	44 33 22 11	11223344

On MS-Windows systems you often want to use "ucs-2le", because it uses little
endian UCS-2.

There are a few encodings which are similar, but not exactly the same.  Vim
treats them as if they were different encodings, so that conversion will be
done when needed.  You might want to use the similar name to avoid conversion
or when conversion is not possible:

	cp932, shift-jis, sjis
	cp936, euc-cn

							*encoding-table*
Normally 'encoding' is equal to your current locale and 'termencoding' is
empty.  This means that your keyboard and display work with characters encoded
in your current locale, and Vim uses the same characters internally.

You can make Vim use characters in a different encoding by setting the
'encoding' option to a different value.  Since the keyboard and display still
use the current locale, conversion needs to be done.  The 'termencoding' then
takes over the value of the current locale, so Vim converts between 'encoding'
and 'termencoding'.  Example: >
	:let &termencoding = &encoding
	:set encoding=utf-8

However, not all combinations of values are possible.  The table below tells
you how each of the nine combinations works.  This is further restricted by
not all conversions being possible, iconv() being present, etc.  Since this
depends on the system used, no detailed list can be given.

('tenc' is the short name for 'termencoding' and 'enc' short for 'encoding')

'tenc'	    'enc'	remark ~

 8bit	    8bit	Works.  When 'termencoding' is different from
			'encoding' typing and displaying may be wrong for some
			characters, Vim does NOT perform conversion (set
			'encoding' to "utf-8" to get this).
 8bit      2byte	MS-Windows: works for all codepages installed on your
			system; you can only type 8bit characters;
			Other systems: does NOT work.
 8bit	   Unicode	Works, but only 8bit characters can be typed directly
			(others through digraphs, keymaps, etc.); in a
			terminal you can only see 8bit characters; the GUI can
			show all characters that the 'guifont' supports.

 2byte	    8bit	Works, but typing non-ASCII characters might
			be a problem.
 2byte	   2byte	MS-Windows: works for all codepages installed on your
			system; typing characters might be a problem when
			locale is different from 'encoding'.
			Other systems: Only works when 'termencoding' is equal
			to 'encoding', you might as well leave it empty.
 2byte	   Unicode	works, Vim will translate typed characters.

 Unicode    8bit	works (unusual)
 Unicode    2byte	does NOT work
 Unicode   Unicode	works very well (leaving 'termencoding' empty works
			the same way, because all Unicode is handled
			internally as UTF-8)

CONVERSION						*charset-conversion*

Vim will automatically convert from one to another encoding in several places:
- When reading a file and 'fileencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When writing a file and 'fileencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When displaying characters and 'termencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When reading input and 'termencoding' is different from 'encoding'
- When displaying messages and the encoding used for LC_MESSAGES differs from
  'encoding' (requires a gettext version that supports this).
- When reading a Vim script where |:scriptencoding| is different from
  'encoding'.
- When reading or writing a |viminfo| file.
Most of these require the |+iconv| feature.  Conversion for reading and
writing files may also be specified with the 'charconvert' option.

Useful utilities for converting the charset:
    All:	    iconv
	GNU iconv can convert most encodings.  Unicode is used as the
	intermediate encoding, which allows conversion from and to all other
	encodings.  See http://www.gnu.org/directory/libiconv.html.

    Japanese:	    nkf
	Nkf is "Network Kanji code conversion Filter".  One of the most unique
	facility of nkf is the guess of the input Kanji code.  So, you don't
	need to know what the inputting file's |charset| is.  When convert to
	EUC-JP from ISO-2022-JP or Shift_JIS, simply do the following command
	in Vim:
	    :%!nkf -e
	Nkf can be found at:
	http://www.sfc.wide.ad.jp/~max/FreeBSD/ports/distfiles/nkf-1.62.tar.gz

    Chinese:	    hc
	Hc is "Hanzi Converter".  Hc convert a GB file to a Big5 file, or Big5
	file to GB file.  Hc can be found at:
	ftp://ftp.cuhk.hk/pub/chinese/ifcss/software/unix/convert/hc-30.tar.gz

    Korean:	    hmconv
	Hmconv is Korean code conversion utility especially for E-mail.  It can
	convert between EUC-KR and ISO-2022-KR.  Hmconv can be found at:
	ftp://ftp.kaist.ac.kr/pub/hangul/code/hmconv/

    Multilingual:   lv
	Lv is a Powerful Multilingual File Viewer.  And it can be worked as
	|charset| converter.  Supported |charset|: ISO-2022-CN, ISO-2022-JP,
	ISO-2022-KR, EUC-CN, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, EUC-TW, UTF-7, UTF-8, ISO-8859
	series, Shift_JIS, Big5 and HZ.  Lv can be found at:
	http://www.ff.iij4u.or.jp/~nrt/lv/index.html


							*mbyte-conversion*
When reading and writing files in an encoding different from 'encoding',
conversion needs to be done.  These conversions are supported:
- All conversions between Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), UTF-8, UCS-2 and UCS-4 are
  handled internally.
- For MS-Windows, when 'encoding' is a Unicode encoding, conversion from and
  to any codepage should work.
- Conversion specified with 'charconvert'
- Conversion with the iconv library, if it is available.
	Old versions of GNU iconv() may cause the conversion to fail (they
	request a very large buffer, more than Vim is willing to provide).
	Try getting another iconv() implementation.

							*iconv-dynamic*
On MS-Windows Vim can be compiled with the |+iconv/dyn| feature.  This means
Vim will search for the "iconv.dll" and "libiconv.dll" libraries.  When
neither of them can be found Vim will still work but some conversions won't be
possible.

==============================================================================
4. Using a terminal					*mbyte-terminal*

The GUI fully supports multi-byte characters.  It is also possible in a
terminal, if the terminal supports the same encoding that Vim uses.  Thus this
is less flexible.

For example, you can run Vim in a xterm with added multi-byte support and/or
|XIM|.  Examples are kterm (Kanji term) and hanterm (for Korean), Eterm
(Enlightened terminal) and rxvt.

If your terminal does not support the right encoding, you can set the
'termencoding' option.  Vim will then convert the typed characters from
'termencoding' to 'encoding'.  And displayed text will be converted from
'encoding' to 'termencoding'.  If the encoding supported by the terminal
doesn't include all the characters that Vim uses, this leads to lost
characters.  This may mess up the display.  If you use a terminal that
supports Unicode, such as the xterm mentioned below, it should work just fine,
since nearly every character set can be converted to Unicode without loss of
information.


UTF-8 IN XFREE86 XTERM					*UTF8-xterm*

This is a short explanation of how to use UTF-8 character encoding in the
xterm that comes with XFree86 by Thomas Dickey (text by Markus Kuhn).

Get the latest xterm version which has now UTF-8 support:

	http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.html

Compile it with "./configure --enable-wide-chars ; make"

Also get the ISO 10646-1 version of various fonts, which is available on

	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts.tar.gz

and install the font as described in the README file.

Now start xterm with >

  xterm -u8 -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso10646-1
or, for bigger character: >
  xterm -u8 -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1

and you will have a working UTF-8 terminal emulator.  Try both >

   cat utf-8-demo.txt
   vim utf-8-demo.txt

with the demo text that comes with ucs-fonts.tar.gz in order to see
whether there are any problems with UTF-8 in your xterm.

For Vim you may need to set 'encoding' to "utf-8".

==============================================================================
5.  Fonts on X11					*mbyte-fonts-X11*

Unfortunately, using fonts in X11 is complicated.  The name of a single-byte
font is a long string.  For multi-byte fonts we need several of these...

Note: Most of this is no longer relevant for GTK+ 2.  Selecting a font via
its XLFD is not supported; see 'guifont' for an example of how to
set the font.  Do yourself a favor and ignore the |XLFD| and |xfontset|
sections below.

First of all, Vim only accepts fixed-width fonts for displaying text.  You
cannot use proportionally spaced fonts.  This excludes many of the available
(and nicer looking) fonts.  However, for menus and tooltips any font can be
used.

Note that Display and Input are independent.  It is possible to see your
language even though you have no input method for it.

You should get a default font for menus and tooltips that works, but it might
be ugly.  Read the following to find out how to select a better font.


X LOGICAL FONT DESCRIPTION (XLFD)
							*XLFD*
XLFD is the X font name and contains the information about the font size,
charset, etc.  The name is in this format:

FOUNDRY-FAMILY-WEIGHT-SLANT-WIDTH-STYLE-PIXEL-POINT-X-Y-SPACE-AVE-CR-CE

Each field means:

- FOUNDRY:  FOUNDRY field.  The company that created the font.
- FAMILY:   FAMILY_NAME field.  Basic font family name.  (helvetica, gothic,
	    times, etc)
- WEIGHT:   WEIGHT_NAME field.  How thick the letters are.  (light, medium,
	    bold, etc)
- SLANT:    SLANT field.
		r:  Roman (no slant)
		i:  Italic
		o:  Oblique
		ri: Reverse Italic
		ro: Reverse Oblique
		ot: Other
		number:	Scaled font
- WIDTH:    SETWIDTH_NAME field.  Width of characters.  (normal, condensed,
	    narrow, double wide)
- STYLE:    ADD_STYLE_NAME field.  Extra info to describe font.  (Serif, Sans
	    Serif, Informal, Decorated, etc)
- PIXEL:    PIXEL_SIZE field.  Height, in pixels, of characters.
- POINT:    POINT_SIZE field.  Ten times height of characters in points.
- X:	    RESOLUTION_X field.  X resolution (dots per inch).
- Y:	    RESOLUTION_Y field.  Y resolution (dots per inch).
- SPACE:    SPACING field.
		p:  Proportional
		m:  Monospaced
		c:  CharCell
- AVE:	    AVERAGE_WIDTH field.  Ten times average width in pixels.
- CR:	    CHARSET_REGISTRY field.  The name of the charset group.
- CE:	    CHARSET_ENCODING field.  The rest of the charset name.  For some
	    charsets, such as JIS X 0208, if this field is 0, code points has
	    the same value as GL, and GR if 1.

For example, in case of a 16 dots font corresponding to JIS X 0208, it is
written like:
    -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-110-100-100-c-160-jisx0208.1990-0


X FONTSET
						*fontset* *xfontset*
A single-byte charset is typically associated with one font.  For multi-byte
charsets a combination of fonts is often used.  This means that one group of
characters are used from one font and another group from another font (which
might be double wide).  This collection of fonts is called a fontset.

Which fonts are required in a fontset depends on the current locale.  X
windows maintains a table of which groups of characters are required for a
locale.  You have to specify all the fonts that a locale requires in the
'guifontset' option.

NOTE: The fontset always uses the current locale, even though 'encoding' may
be set to use a different charset.  In that situation you might want to use
'guifont' and 'guifontwide' instead of 'guifontset'.

Example:
    |charset| language		    "groups of characters" ~
    GB2312    Chinese (simplified)  ISO-8859-1 and GB 2312
    Big5      Chinese (traditional) ISO-8859-1 and Big5
    CNS-11643 Chinese (traditional) ISO-8859-1, CNS 11643-1 and CNS 11643-2
    EUC-JP    Japanese		    JIS X 0201 and JIS X 0208
    EUC-KR    Korean		    ISO-8859-1 and KS C 5601 (KS X 1001)

You can search for fonts using the xlsfonts command.  For example, when you're
searching for a font for KS C 5601: >
    xlsfonts | grep ksc5601

This is complicated and confusing.  You might want to consult the X-Windows
documentation if there is something you don't understand.

						*base_font_name_list*
When you have found the names of the fonts you want to use, you need to set
the 'guifontset' option.  You specify the list by concatenating the font names
and putting a comma in between them.

For example, when you use the ja_JP.eucJP locale, this requires JIS X 0201
and JIS X 0208.  You could supply a list of fonts that explicitly specifies
the charsets, like: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140-jisx0208.1983-0,
	\-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70-jisx0201.1976-0

Alternatively, you can supply a base font name list that omits the charset
name, letting X-Windows select font characters required for the locale.  For
example: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140,
	\-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70

Alternatively, you can supply a single base font name that allows X-Windows to
select from all available fonts.  For example: >

 :set guifontset=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*

Alternatively, you can specify alias names.  See the fonts.alias file in the
fonts directory (e.g., /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/).  For example: >

 :set guifontset=k14,r14
<
							*E253*
Note that in East Asian fonts, the standard character cell is square.  When
mixing a Latin font and an East Asian font, the East Asian font width should
be twice the Latin font width.

If 'guifontset' is not empty, the "font" argument of the |:highlight| command
is also interpreted as a fontset.  For example, you should use for
highlighting: >
	:hi Comment font=english_font,your_font
If you use a wrong "font" argument you will get an error message.
Also make sure that you set 'guifontset' before setting fonts for highlight
groups.


USING RESOURCE FILES

Instead of specifying 'guifontset', you can set X11 resources and Vim will
pick them up.  This is only for people who know how X resource files work.

For Motif and Athena insert these three lines in your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:

	Vim.font: |base_font_name_list|
	Vim*fontSet: |base_font_name_list|
	Vim*fontList: your_language_font

Note: Vim.font is for text area.
      Vim*fontSet is for menu.
      Vim*fontList is for menu (for Motif GUI)

For example, when you are using Japanese and a 14 dots font, >

	Vim.font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
	Vim*fontSet: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
	Vim*fontList: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*
<
or: >

	Vim*font: k14,r14
	Vim*fontSet: k14,r14
	Vim*fontList: k14,r14
<
To have them take effect immediately you will have to do >

	xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults

Otherwise you will have to stop and restart the X server before the changes
take effect.


The GTK+ version of GUI Vim does not use .Xdefaults, use ~/.gtkrc instead.
The default mostly works OK.  But for the menus you might have to change
it.  Example: >

	style "default"
	{
		fontset="-*-*-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-c-*-*-*"
	}
	widget_class "*" style "default"

==============================================================================
6.  Fonts on MS-Windows				*mbyte-fonts-MSwin*

The simplest is to use the font dialog to select fonts and try them out.  You
can find this at the "Edit/Select Font..." menu.  Once you find a font name
that works well you can use this command to see its name: >

	:set guifont

Then add a command to your |gvimrc| file to set 'guifont': >

	:set guifont=courier_new:h12

==============================================================================
7.  Input on X11				*mbyte-XIM*

X INPUT METHOD (XIM) BACKGROUND			*XIM* *xim* *x-input-method*

XIM is an international input module for X.  There are two kinds of structures,
Xlib unit type and |IM-server| (Input-Method server) type.  |IM-server| type
is suitable for complex input, such as CJK.

- IM-server
							*IM-server*
  In |IM-server| type input structures, the input event is handled by either
  of the two ways: FrontEnd system and BackEnd system.  In the FrontEnd
  system, input events are snatched by the |IM-server| first, then |IM-server|
  give the application the result of input.  On the other hand, the BackEnd
  system works reverse order.  MS Windows adopt BackEnd system.  In X, most of
  |IM-server|s adopt FrontEnd system.  The demerit of BackEnd system is the
  large overhead in communication, but it provides safe synchronization with
  no restrictions on applications.

  For example, there are xwnmo and kinput2 Japanese |IM-server|, both are
  FrontEnd system.  Xwnmo is distributed with Wnn (see below), kinput2 can be
  found at: ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/x11/kinput2/

  For Chinese, there's a great XIM server named "xcin", you can input both
  Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters.  And it can accept other
  locale if you make a correct input table.  Xcin can be found at:
  http://cle.linux.org.tw/xcin/
  Others are scim: http://scim.freedesktop.org/ and fcitx:
  http://www.fcitx.org/

- Conversion Server
							*conversion-server*
  Some system needs additional server: conversion server.  Most of Japanese
  |IM-server|s need it, Kana-Kanji conversion server.  For Chinese inputting,
  it depends on the method of inputting, in some methods, PinYin or ZhuYin to
  HanZi conversion server is needed.  For Korean inputting, if you want to
  input Hanja, Hangul-Hanja conversion server is needed.

  For example, the Japanese inputting process is divided into 2 steps.  First
  we pre-input Hira-gana, second Kana-Kanji conversion.  There are so many
  Kanji characters (6349 Kanji characters are defined in JIS X 0208) and the
  number of Hira-gana characters are 76.  So, first, we pre-input text as
  pronounced in Hira-gana, second, we convert Hira-gana to Kanji or Kata-Kana,
  if needed.  There are some Kana-Kanji conversion server: jserver
  (distributed with Wnn, see below) and canna.  Canna can be found at:
  http://canna.sourceforge.jp/

There is a good input system: Wnn4.2.  Wnn 4.2 contains,
    xwnmo (|IM-server|)
    jserver (Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion server)
    cserver (Chinese PinYin or ZhuYin to simplified HanZi conversion server)
    tserver (Chinese PinYin or ZhuYin to traditional HanZi conversion server)
    kserver (Hangul-Hanja conversion server)
Wnn 4.2 for several systems can be found at various places on the internet.
Use the RPM or port for your system.


- Input Style
							*xim-input-style*
  When inputting CJK, there are four areas:
      1. The area to display of the input while it is being composed
      2. The area to display the currently active input mode.
      3. The area to display the next candidate for the selection.
      4. The area to display other tools.

  The third area is needed when converting.  For example, in Japanese
  inputting, multiple Kanji characters could have the same pronunciation, so
  a sequence of Hira-gana characters could map to a distinct sequence of Kanji
  characters.

  The first and second areas are defined in international input of X with the
  names of "Preedit Area", "Status Area" respectively.  The third and fourth
  areas are not defined and are left to be managed by the |IM-server|.  In the
  international input, four input styles have been defined using combinations
  of Preedit Area and Status Area: |OnTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot|, |OverTheSpot|
  and |Root|.

  Currently, GUI Vim supports three styles, |OverTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot| and
  |Root|.

*.  on-the-spot						*OnTheSpot*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are performed by the client application in
    the area of application.  The client application is directed by the
    |IM-server| to display all pre-edit data at the location of text
    insertion.  The client registers callbacks invoked by the input method
    during pre-editing.
*.  over-the-spot					*OverTheSpot*
    Status Area is created in a fixed position within the area of application,
    in case of Vim, the position is the additional status line.  Preedit Area
    is made at present input position of application.  The input method
    displays pre-edit data in a window which it brings up directly over the
    text insertion position.
*.  off-the-spot					*OffTheSpot*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are performed in the area of application, in
    case of Vim, the area is additional status line.  The client application
    provides display windows for the pre-edit data to the input method which
    displays into them directly.
*.  root-window						*Root*
    Preedit Area and Status Area are outside of the application.  The input
    method displays all pre-edit data in a separate area of the screen in a
    window specific to the input method.


USING XIM			*multibyte-input* *E284* *E286* *E287* *E288*
				*E285* *E289*

Note that Display and Input are independent.  It is possible to see your
language even though you have no input method for it.  But when your Display
method doesn't match your Input method, the text will be displayed wrong.

	Note: You can not use IM unless you specify 'guifontset'.
	      Therefore, Latin users, you have to also use 'guifontset'
	      if you use IM.

To input your language you should run the |IM-server| which supports your
language and |conversion-server| if needed.

The next 3 lines should be put in your ~/.Xdefaults file.  They are common for
all X applications which uses |XIM|.  If you already use |XIM|, you can skip
this. >

	*international: True
	*.inputMethod: your_input_server_name
	*.preeditType: your_input_style
<
input_server_name	is your |IM-server| name (check your |IM-server|
			manual).
your_input_style	is one of |OverTheSpot|, |OffTheSpot|, |Root|.  See
			also |xim-input-style|.

*international may not necessary if you use X11R6.
*.inputMethod and *.preeditType are optional if you use X11R6.

For example, when you are using kinput2 as |IM-server|, >

	*international: True
	*.inputMethod: kinput2
	*.preeditType: OverTheSpot
<
When using |OverTheSpot|, GUI Vim always connects to the IM Server even in
Normal mode, so you can input your language with commands like "f" and "r".
But when using one of the other two methods, GUI Vim connects to the IM Server
only if it is not in Normal mode.

If your IM Server does not support |OverTheSpot|, and if you want to use your
language with some Normal mode command like "f" or "r", then you should use a
localized xterm  or an xterm which supports |XIM|

If needed, you can set the XMODIFIERS environment variable:

	sh:  export XMODIFIERS="@im=input_server_name"
	csh: setenv XMODIFIERS "@im=input_server_name"

For example, when you are using kinput2 as |IM-server| and sh, >

	export XMODIFIERS="@im=kinput2"
<

FULLY CONTROLLED XIM

You can fully control XIM, like with IME of MS-Windows (see |multibyte-ime|).
This is currently only available for the GTK GUI.

Before using fully controlled XIM, one setting is required.  Set the
'imactivatekey' option to the key that is used for the activation of the input
method.  For example, when you are using kinput2 + canna as IM Server, the
activation key is probably Shift+Space: >

	:set imactivatekey=S-space

See 'imactivatekey' for the format.

==============================================================================
8.  Input on MS-Windows					*mbyte-IME*

(Windows IME support)				*multibyte-ime* *IME*

{only works Windows GUI and compiled with the |+multi_byte_ime| feature}

To input multibyte characters on Windows, you can use an Input Method Editor
(IME).  In process of your editing text, you must switch status (on/off) of
IME many many many times.  Because IME with status on is hooking all of your
key inputs, you cannot input 'j', 'k', or almost all of keys to Vim directly.

This |+multi_byte_ime| feature help this.  It reduce times of switch status of
IME manually.  In normal mode, there are almost no need working IME, even
editing multibyte text.  So exiting insert mode with ESC, Vim memorize last
status of IME and force turn off IME.  When re-enter insert mode, Vim revert
IME status to that memorized automatically.

This works on not only insert-normal mode, but also search-command input and
replace mode.
The options 'iminsert', 'imsearch' and 'imcmdline' can be used to chose
the different input methods or disable them temporarily.

WHAT IS IME
    IME is a part of East asian version Windows.  That helps you to input
    multibyte character.  English and other language version Windows does not
    have any IME.  (Also there is no need usually.) But there is one that
    called Microsoft Global IME.  Global IME is a part of Internet Explorer
    4.0 or above.  You can get more information about Global IME, at below
    URL.

WHAT IS GLOBAL IME					*global-ime*
    Global IME makes capability to input Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text
    into Vim buffer on any language version of Windows 98, Windows 95, and
    Windows NT 4.0.
    On Windows 2000 and XP it should work as well (without downloading).  On
    Windows 2000 Professional, Global IME is built in, and the Input Locales
    can be added through Control Panel/Regional Options/Input Locales.
    Please see below URL for detail of Global IME.  You can also find various
    language version of Global IME at same place.

    - Global IME detailed information.
	http://search.microsoft.com/results.aspx?q=global+ime

    - Active Input Method Manager (Global IME)
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741221(v=VS.85).aspx

    Support for Global IME is an experimental feature.

NOTE: For IME to work you must make sure the input locales of your language
are added to your system.  The exact location of this depends on the version
of Windows you use.  For example, on my Windows 2000 box:
1. Control Panel
2. Regional Options
3. Input Locales Tab
4. Add Installed input locales -> Chinese(PRC)
   The default is still English (United Stated)


Cursor color when IME or XIM is on				*CursorIM*
    There is a little cute feature for IME.  Cursor can indicate status of IME
    by changing its color.  Usually status of IME was indicated by little icon
    at a corner of desktop (or taskbar).  It is not easy to verify status of
    IME.  But this feature help this.
    This works in the same way when using XIM.

    You can select cursor color when status is on by using highlight group
    CursorIM.  For example, add these lines to your |gvimrc|: >

	if has('multi_byte_ime')
	    highlight Cursor guifg=NONE guibg=Green
	    highlight CursorIM guifg=NONE guibg=Purple
	endif
<
    Cursor color with off IME is green.  And purple cursor indicates that
    status is on.

==============================================================================
9. Input with a keymap					*mbyte-keymap*

When the keyboard doesn't produce the characters you want to enter in your
text, you can use the 'keymap' option.  This will translate one or more
(English) characters to another (non-English) character.  This only happens
when typing text, not when typing Vim commands.  This avoids having to switch
between two keyboard settings.
{only available when compiled with the |+keymap| feature}

The value of the 'keymap' option specifies a keymap file to use.  The name of
this file is one of these two:

	keymap/{keymap}_{encoding}.vim
	keymap/{keymap}.vim

Here {keymap} is the value of the 'keymap' option and {encoding} of the
'encoding' option.  The file name with the {encoding} included is tried first.

'runtimepath' is used to find these files.  To see an overview of all
available keymap files, use this: >
	:echo globpath(&rtp, "keymap/*.vim")

In Insert and Command-line mode you can use CTRL-^ to toggle between using the
keyboard map or not. |i_CTRL-^| |c_CTRL-^|
This flag is remembered for Insert mode with the 'iminsert' option.  When
leaving and entering Insert mode the previous value is used.  The same value
is also used for commands that take a single character argument, like |f| and
|r|.
For Command-line mode the flag is NOT remembered.  You are expected to type an
Ex command first, which is ASCII.
For typing search patterns the 'imsearch' option is used.  It can be set to
use the same value as for 'iminsert'.
								*lCursor*
It is possible to give the GUI cursor another color when the language mappings
are being used.  This is disabled by default, to avoid that the cursor becomes
invisible when you use a non-standard background color.  Here is an example to
use a brightly colored cursor: >
	:highlight Cursor guifg=NONE guibg=Green
	:highlight lCursor guifg=NONE guibg=Cyan
<
		*keymap-file-format* *:loadk* *:loadkeymap* *E105* *E791*
The keymap file looks something like this: >

	" Maintainer:	name <email@address>
	" Last Changed:	2001 Jan 1

	let b:keymap_name = "short"

	loadkeymap
	a	A
	b	B	comment

The lines starting with a " are comments and will be ignored.  Blank lines are
also ignored.  The lines with the mappings may have a comment after the useful
text.

The "b:keymap_name" can be set to a short name, which will be shown in the
status line.  The idea is that this takes less room than the value of
'keymap', which might be long to distinguish between different languages,
keyboards and encodings.

The actual mappings are in the lines below "loadkeymap".  In the example "a"
is mapped to "A" and "b" to "B".  Thus the first item is mapped to the second
item.  This is done for each line, until the end of the file.
These items are exactly the same as what can be used in a |:lnoremap| command,
using "<buffer>" to make the mappings local to the buffer.
You can check the result with this command: >
	:lmap
The two items must be separated by white space.  You cannot include white
space inside an item, use the special names "<Tab>" and "<Space>" instead.
The length of the two items together must not exceed 200 bytes.

It's possible to have more than one character in the first column.  This works
like a dead key.  Example: >
	'a	á
Since Vim doesn't know if the next character after a quote is really an "a",
it will wait for the next character.  To be able to insert a single quote,
also add this line: >
	''	'
Since the mapping is defined with |:lnoremap| the resulting quote will not be
used for the start of another character.
The "accents" keymap uses this.				*keymap-accents*

The first column can also be in |<>| form:
	<C-c>		Ctrl-C
	<A-c>		Alt-c
	<A-C>		Alt-C
Note that the Alt mappings may not work, depending on your keyboard and
terminal.

Although it's possible to have more than one character in the second column,
this is unusual.  But you can use various ways to specify the character: >
	A	a		literal character
	A	<char-97>	decimal value
	A	<char-0x61>	hexadecimal value
	A	<char-0141>	octal value
	x	<Space>		special key name

The characters are assumed to be encoded for the current value of 'encoding'.
It's possible to use ":scriptencoding" when all characters are given
literally.  That doesn't work when using the <char-> construct, because the
conversion is done on the keymap file, not on the resulting character.

The lines after "loadkeymap" are interpreted with 'cpoptions' set to "C".
This means that continuation lines are not used and a backslash has a special
meaning in the mappings.  Examples: >

	" a comment line
	\"	x	maps " to x
	\\	y	maps \ to y

If you write a keymap file that will be useful for others, consider submitting
it to the Vim maintainer for inclusion in the distribution:
<maintainer@vim.org>

10. Using UTF-8				*mbyte-utf8* *UTF-8* *utf-8* *utf8*
							*Unicode* *unicode*
The Unicode character set was designed to include all characters from other
character sets.  Therefore it is possible to write text in any language using
Unicode (with a few rarely used languages excluded).  And it's mostly possible
to mix these languages in one file, which is impossible with other encodings.

Unicode can be encoded in several ways.  The most popular one is UTF-8, which
uses one or more bytes for each character and is backwards compatible with
ASCII.   On MS-Windows UTF-16 is also used (previously UCS-2), which uses
16-bit words.  Vim can support all of these encodings, but always uses UTF-8
internally.

Vim has comprehensive UTF-8 support.  It works well in:
- xterm with utf-8 support enabled
- Athena, Motif and GTK GUI
- MS-Windows GUI
- several other platforms

Double-width characters are supported.  This works best with 'guifontwide' or
'guifontset'.  When using only 'guifont' the wide characters are drawn in the
normal width and a space to fill the gap.  Note that the 'guifontset' option
is no longer relevant in the GTK+ 2 GUI.

							*bom-bytes*
When reading a file a BOM (Byte Order Mark) can be used to recognize the
Unicode encoding:
	EF BB BF     utf-8
	FE FF        utf-16 big endian
	FF FE        utf-16 little endian
	00 00 FE FF  utf-32 big endian
	FF FE 00 00  utf-32 little endian

Utf-8 is the recommended encoding.  Note that it's difficult to tell utf-16
and utf-32 apart.  Utf-16 is often used on MS-Windows, utf-32 is not
widespread as file format.


					*mbyte-combining* *mbyte-composing*
A composing or combining character is used to change the meaning of the
character before it.  The combining characters are drawn on top of the
preceding character.
Up to two combining characters can be used by default.  This can be changed
with the 'maxcombine' option.
When editing text a composing character is mostly considered part of the
preceding character.  For example "x" will delete a character and its
following composing characters by default.
If the 'delcombine' option is on, then pressing 'x' will delete the combining
characters, one at a time, then the base character.  But when inserting, you
type the first character and the following composing characters separately,
after which they will be joined.  The "r" command will not allow you to type a
combining character, because it doesn't know one is coming.  Use "R" instead.

Bytes which are not part of a valid UTF-8 byte sequence are handled like a
single character and displayed as <xx>, where "xx" is the hex value of the
byte.

Overlong sequences are not handled specially and displayed like a valid
character.  However, search patterns may not match on an overlong sequence.
(an overlong sequence is where more bytes are used than required for the
character.)  An exception is NUL (zero) which is displayed as "<00>".

In the file and buffer the full range of Unicode characters can be used (31
bits).  However, displaying only works for the characters present in the
selected font.

Useful commands:
- "ga" shows the decimal, hexadecimal and octal value of the character under
  the cursor.  If there are composing characters these are shown too.  (If the
  message is truncated, use ":messages").
- "g8" shows the bytes used in a UTF-8 character, also the composing
  characters, as hex numbers.
- ":set encoding=utf-8 fileencodings=" forces using UTF-8 for all files.  The
  default is to use the current locale for 'encoding' and set 'fileencodings'
  to automatically detect the encoding of a file.


STARTING VIM

If your current locale is in an utf-8 encoding, Vim will automatically start
in utf-8 mode.

If you are using another locale: >

	set encoding=utf-8

You might also want to select the font used for the menus.  Unfortunately this
doesn't always work.  See the system specific remarks below, and 'langmenu'.


USING UTF-8 IN X-Windows				*utf-8-in-xwindows*

Note: This section does not apply to the GTK+ 2 GUI.

You need to specify a font to be used.  For double-wide characters another
font is required, which is exactly twice as wide.  There are three ways to do
this:

1. Set 'guifont' and let Vim find a matching 'guifontwide'
2. Set 'guifont' and 'guifontwide'
3. Set 'guifontset'

See the documentation for each option for details.  Example: >

   :set guifont=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1

You might also want to set the font used for the menus.  This only works for
Motif.  Use the ":hi Menu font={fontname}" command for this. |:highlight|


TYPING UTF-8						*utf-8-typing*

If you are using X-Windows, you should find an input method that supports
utf-8.

If your system does not provide support for typing utf-8, you can use the
'keymap' feature.  This allows writing a keymap file, which defines a utf-8
character as a sequence of ASCII characters.  See |mbyte-keymap|.

Another method is to set the current locale to the language you want to use
and for which you have a XIM available.  Then set 'termencoding' to that
language and Vim will convert the typed characters to 'encoding' for you.

If everything else fails, you can type any character as four hex bytes: >

	CTRL-V u 1234

"1234" is interpreted as a hex number.  You must type four characters, prepend
a zero if necessary.


COMMAND ARGUMENTS					*utf-8-char-arg*

Commands like |f|, |F|, |t| and |r| take an argument of one character.  For
UTF-8 this argument may include one or two composing characters.  These need
to be produced together with the base character, Vim doesn't wait for the next
character to be typed to find out if it is a composing character or not.
Using 'keymap' or |:lmap| is a nice way to type these characters.

The commands that search for a character in a line handle composing characters
as follows.  When searching for a character without a composing character,
this will find matches in the text with or without composing characters.  When
searching for a character with a composing character, this will only find
matches with that composing character.  It was implemented this way, because
not everybody is able to type a composing character.


==============================================================================
11. Overview of options					*mbyte-options*

These options are relevant for editing multi-byte files.  Check the help in
options.txt for detailed information.

'encoding'	Encoding used for the keyboard and display.  It is also the
		default encoding for files.

'fileencoding'	Encoding of a file.  When it's different from 'encoding'
		conversion is done when reading or writing the file.

'fileencodings'	List of possible encodings of a file.  When opening a file
		these will be tried and the first one that doesn't cause an
		error is used for 'fileencoding'.

'charconvert'	Expression used to convert files from one encoding to another.

'formatoptions' The 'm' flag can be included to have formatting break a line
		at a multibyte character of 256 or higher.  Thus is useful for
		languages where a sequence of characters can be broken
		anywhere.

'guifontset'	The list of font names used for a multi-byte encoding.  When
		this option is not empty, it replaces 'guifont'.

'keymap'	Specify the name of a keyboard mapping.

Last change: 2017 Jan 02


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


This file contains an alphabetical list of messages and error messages that
Vim produces.  You can use this if you don't understand what the message
means.  It is not complete though.

1. Old messages		|:messages|
2. Error messages	|error-messages|
3. Messages		|messages|

==============================================================================
1. Old messages			*:messages* *:mes* *message-history*

The ":messages" command can be used to view previously given messages.  This
is especially useful when messages have been overwritten or truncated.  This
depends on the 'shortmess' option.

	:messages		Show all messages.

	:{count}messages	Show the {count} most recent messages.

	:messages clear		Clear all messages.

	:{count}messages clear	Clear messages, keeping only the {count} most
				recent ones.

The number of remembered messages is fixed at 20 for the tiny version and 200
for other versions.

								*g<*
The "g<" command can be used to see the last page of previous command output.
This is especially useful if you accidentally typed <Space> at the hit-enter
prompt.  You are then back at the hit-enter prompt and can then scroll further
back.
Note: If the output has been stopped with "q" at the more prompt, it will only
be displayed up to this point.
The previous command output is cleared when another command produces output.
The "g<" output is not redirected.

If you are using translated messages, the first printed line tells who
maintains the messages or the translations.  You can use this to contact the
maintainer when you spot a mistake.

If you want to find help on a specific (error) message, use the ID at the
start of the message.  For example, to get help on the message: >

	E72: Close error on swap file

or (translated): >

	E72: Errore durante chiusura swap file

Use: >

	:help E72

If you are lazy, it also works without the shift key: >

	:help e72

==============================================================================
2. Error messages				*error-messages* *errors*

When an error message is displayed, but it is removed before you could read
it, you can see it again with: >
  :echo errmsg
Or view a list of recent messages with: >
  :messages
See `:messages` above.


LIST OF MESSAGES
			*E222* *E228* *E232* *E256* *E293* *E298* *E304* *E317*

  Internal error: {function}

This is an internal error.  If you can reproduce it, please send in a bug
report. |bugs|

>
  ATTENTION
  Found a swap file by the name ...

See |ATTENTION|.

							*E92*  >
  Buffer {N} not found

The buffer you requested does not exist.  This can also happen when you have
wiped out a buffer which contains a mark or is referenced in another way.
|:bwipeout|

							*E95*  >
  Buffer with this name already exists

You cannot have two buffers with the same name.

							*E72*  >
  Close error on swap file

The |swap-file|, that is used to keep a copy of the edited text, could not be
closed properly.  Mostly harmless.

							*E169*  >
  Command too recursive

This happens when an Ex command executes an Ex command that executes an Ex
command, etc.  The limit is 200 or the value of 'maxfuncdepth', whatever is
larger.  When it's more there probably is an endless loop.  Probably a
|:execute| or |:source| command is involved.

							*E254*  >
  Cannot allocate color {name}

The color name {name} is unknown.  See |gui-colors| for a list of colors that
are available on most systems.

							*E458*  >
  Cannot allocate colormap entry, some colors may be incorrect

This means that there are not enough colors available for Vim.  It will still
run, but some of the colors will not appear in the specified color.  Try
stopping other applications that use many colors, or start them after starting
gvim.
Browsers are known to consume a lot of colors.  You can avoid this with
netscape by telling it to use its own colormap: >
	netscape -install
Or tell it to limit to a certain number of colors (64 should work well): >
	netscape -ncols 64
This can also be done with a line in your Xdefaults file: >
	Netscape*installColormap: Yes
or >
	Netscape*maxImageColors:  64
<
							*E79*  >
  Cannot expand wildcards

A filename contains a strange combination of characters, which causes Vim to
attempt expanding wildcards but this fails.  This does NOT mean that no
matching file names could be found, but that the pattern was illegal.

							*E459*  >
  Cannot go back to previous directory

While expanding a file name, Vim failed to go back to the previously used
directory.  All file names being used may be invalid now!  You need to have
execute permission on the current directory.

							*E190* *E212*  >
  Cannot open "{filename}" for writing
  Can't open file for writing

For some reason the file you are writing to cannot be created or overwritten.
The reason could be that you do not have permission to write in the directory
or the file name is not valid.

							*E166*  >
  Can't open linked file for writing

You are trying to write to a file which can't be overwritten, and the file is
a link (either a hard link or a symbolic link).  Writing might still be
possible if the directory that contains the link or the file is writable, but
Vim now doesn't know if you want to delete the link and write the file in its
place, or if you want to delete the file itself and write the new file in its
place.  If you really want to write the file under this name, you have to
manually delete the link or the file, or change the permissions so that Vim
can overwrite.

							*E46*  >
  Cannot change read-only variable "{name}"

You are trying to assign a value to an argument of a function |a:var| or a Vim
internal variable |v:var| which is read-only.

							*E90*  >
  Cannot unload last buffer

Vim always requires one buffer to be loaded, otherwise there would be nothing
to display in the window.

							*E40*  >
  Can't open errorfile <filename>

When using the ":make" or ":grep" commands: The file used to save the error
messages or grep output cannot be opened.  This can have several causes:
- 'shellredir' has a wrong value.
- The shell changes directory, causing the error file to be written in another
  directory.  This could be fixed by changing 'makeef', but then the make
  command is still executed in the wrong directory.
- 'makeef' has a wrong value.
- The 'grepprg' or 'makeprg' could not be executed.  This cannot always be
  detected (especially on MS-Windows).  Check your $PATH.

 >
  Can't open file C:\TEMP\VIoD243.TMP

On MS-Windows, this message appears when the output of an external command was
to be read, but the command didn't run successfully.  This can be caused by
many things.  Check the 'shell', 'shellquote', 'shellxquote', 'shellslash' and
related options.  It might also be that the external command was not found,
there is no different error message for that.

							*E12*  >
  Command not allowed from exrc/vimrc in current dir or tag search

Some commands are not allowed for security reasons.  These commands mostly
come from a .exrc or .vimrc file in the current directory, or from a tags
file.  Also see 'secure'.

							*E74*  >
  Command too complex

A mapping resulted in a very long command string.  Could be caused by a
mapping that indirectly calls itself.

>
  CONVERSION ERROR

When writing a file and the text "CONVERSION ERROR" appears, this means that
some bits were lost when converting text from the internally used UTF-8 to the
format of the file.  The file will not be marked unmodified.  If you care
about the loss of information, set the 'fileencoding' option to another value
that can handle the characters in the buffer and write again.  If you don't
care, you can abandon the buffer or reset the 'modified' option.

							*E302*  >
  Could not rename swap file

When the file name changes, Vim tries to rename the |swap-file| as well.
This failed and the old swap file is now still used.  Mostly harmless.

							*E43* *E44*  >
  Damaged match string
  Corrupted regexp program

Something inside Vim went wrong and resulted in a corrupted regexp.  If you
know how to reproduce this problem, please report it. |bugs|

							*E208* *E209* *E210*  >
  Error writing to "{filename}"
  Error closing "{filename}"
  Error reading "{filename}"

This occurs when Vim is trying to rename a file, but a simple change of file
name doesn't work.  Then the file will be copied, but somehow this failed.
The result may be that both the original file and the destination file exist
and the destination file may be incomplete.

>
  Vim: Error reading input, exiting...

This occurs when Vim cannot read typed characters while input is required.
Vim got stuck, the only thing it can do is exit.  This can happen when both
stdin and stderr are redirected and executing a script that doesn't exit Vim.

							*E47*  >
  Error while reading errorfile

Reading the error file was not possible.  This is NOT caused by an error
message that was not recognized.

							*E80*  >
  Error while writing

Writing a file was not completed successfully.  The file is probably
incomplete.

							*E13* *E189*  >
  File exists (add ! to override)
  "{filename}" exists (add ! to override)

You are protected from accidentally overwriting a file.  When you want to
write anyway, use the same command, but add a "!" just after the command.
Example: >
	:w /tmp/test
changes to: >
	:w! /tmp/test
<
							*E768*  >
  Swap file exists: {filename} (:silent! overrides)

You are protected from overwriting a file that is being edited by Vim.  This
happens when you use ":w! filename" and a swapfile is found.
- If the swapfile was left over from an old crashed edit session you may want
  to delete the swapfile.  Edit {filename} to find out information about the
  swapfile.
- If you want to write anyway prepend ":silent!" to the command.  For example: >
	:silent! w! /tmp/test
< The special command is needed, since you already added the ! for overwriting
  an existing file.

							*E139*  >
  File is loaded in another buffer

You are trying to write a file under a name which is also used in another
buffer.  This would result in two versions of the same file.

							*E142*  >
  File not written: Writing is disabled by 'write' option

The 'write' option is off.  This makes all commands that try to write a file
generate this message.  This could be caused by a |-m| commandline argument.
You can switch the 'write' option on with ":set write".

							*E25*  >
  GUI cannot be used: Not enabled at compile time

You are running a version of Vim that doesn't include the GUI code.  Therefore
"gvim" and ":gui" don't work.

							*E49*  >
  Invalid scroll size

This is caused by setting an invalid value for the 'scroll', 'scrolljump' or
'scrolloff' options.

							*E17*  >
  "{filename}" is a directory

You tried to write a file with the name of a directory.  This is not possible.
You probably need to append a file name.

							*E19*  >
  Mark has invalid line number

You are using a mark that has a line number that doesn't exist.  This can
happen when you have a mark in another file, and some other program has
deleted lines from it.

							*E219* *E220*  >
  Missing {.
  Missing }.

Using a {} construct in a file name, but there is a { without a matching } or
the other way around.  It should be used like this: {foo,bar}.  This matches
"foo" and "bar".

							*E315*  >
  ml_get: invalid lnum: {number}

This is an internal Vim error.  Please try to find out how it can be
reproduced, and submit a bug report |bugreport.vim|.

							*E173*  >
  {number} more files to edit

You are trying to exit, while the last item in the argument list has not been
edited.  This protects you from accidentally exiting when you still have more
files to work on.  See |argument-list|.  If you do want to exit, just do it
again and it will work.

							*E23* *E194*  >
  No alternate file
  No alternate file name to substitute for '#'

The alternate file is not defined yet.  See |alternate-file|.

							*E32*  >
  No file name

The current buffer has no name.  To write it, use ":w fname".  Or give the
buffer a name with ":file fname".

							*E141*  >
  No file name for buffer {number}

One of the buffers that was changed does not have a file name.  Therefore it
cannot be written.  You need to give the buffer a file name: >
	:buffer {number}
	:file {filename}
<
							*E33*  >
  No previous substitute regular expression

When using the '~' character in a pattern, it is replaced with the previously
used pattern in a ":substitute" command.  This fails when no such command has
been used yet.  See |/~|.  This also happens when using ":s/pat/%/", where the
"%" stands for the previous substitute string.

							*E35*  >
  No previous regular expression

When using an empty search pattern, the previous search pattern is used.  But
that is not possible if there was no previous search.

							*E24*  >
  No such abbreviation

You have used an ":unabbreviate" command with an argument which is not an
existing abbreviation.  All variations of this command give the same message:
":cunabbrev", ":iunabbrev", etc.  Check for trailing white space.

>
  /dev/dsp: No such file or directory

Only given for GTK GUI with Gnome support.  Gnome tries to use the audio
device and it isn't present.  You can ignore this error.

							*E31*  >
  No such mapping

You have used an ":unmap" command with an argument which is not an existing
mapping.  All variations of this command give the same message: ":cunmap",
":unmap!", etc.  A few hints:
- Check for trailing white space.
- If the mapping is buffer-local you need to use ":unmap <buffer>".
  |:map-<buffer>|

							*E37* *E89*  >
  No write since last change (add ! to override)
  No write since last change for buffer {N} (add ! to override)

You are trying to |abandon| a file that has changes.  Vim protects you from
losing your work.  You can either write the changed file with ":w", or, if you
are sure, |abandon| it anyway, and lose all the changes.  This can be done by
adding a '!' character just after the command you used.  Example: >
	:e other_file
changes to: >
	:e! other_file
<
							*E162*  >
  No write since last change for buffer "{name}"

This appears when you try to exit Vim while some buffers are changed.  You
will either have to write the changed buffer (with |:w|), or use a command to
abandon the buffer forcefully, e.g., with ":qa!".  Careful, make sure you
don't throw away changes you really want to keep.  You might have forgotten
about a buffer, especially when 'hidden' is set.

>
  [No write since last change]

This appears when executing a shell command while at least one buffer was
changed.  To avoid the message reset the 'warn' option.

							*E38*  >
  Null argument

Something inside Vim went wrong and resulted in a NULL pointer.  If you know
how to reproduce this problem, please report it. |bugs|

							*E172*  >
  Only one file name allowed

The ":edit" command only accepts one file name.  When you want to specify
several files for editing use ":next" |:next|.

						*E41* *E82* *E83* *E342*  >
  Out of memory!
  Out of memory!  (allocating {number} bytes)
  Cannot allocate any buffer, exiting...
  Cannot allocate buffer, using other one...

Oh, oh.  You must have been doing something complicated, or some other program
is consuming your memory.  Be careful!  Vim is not completely prepared for an
out-of-memory situation.  First make sure that any changes are saved.  Then
try to solve the memory shortage.  To stay on the safe side, exit Vim and
start again.

Buffers are only partly kept in memory, thus editing a very large file is
unlikely to cause an out-of-memory situation.  Undo information is completely
in memory, you can reduce that with these options:
- 'undolevels'  Set to a low value, or to -1 to disable undo completely.  This
  helps for a change that affects all lines.
- 'undoreload' Set to zero to disable.

							*E339*  >
  Pattern too long

This happens on systems with 16 bit ints: The compiled regexp pattern is
longer than about 65000 characters.  Try using a shorter pattern.
It also happens when the offset of a rule doesn't fit in the space available.
Try simplifying the pattern.

							*E45*  >
  'readonly' option is set (add ! to override)

You are trying to write a file that was marked as read-only.  To write the
file anyway, either reset the 'readonly' option, or add a '!' character just
after the command you used.  Example: >
	:w
changes to: >
	:w!
<
							*E294* *E295* *E301*  >
  Read error in swap file
  Seek error in swap file read
  Oops, lost the swap file!!!

Vim tried to read text from the |swap-file|, but something went wrong.  The
text in the related buffer may now be corrupted!  Check carefully before you
write a buffer.  You may want to write it in another file and check for
differences.

							*E192*  >
  Recursive use of :normal too deep

You are using a ":normal" command, whose argument again uses a ":normal"
command in a recursive way.  This is restricted to 'maxmapdepth' levels.  This
example illustrates how to get this message: >
	:map gq :normal gq<CR>
If you type "gq", it will execute this mapping, which will call "gq" again.

							*E22*  >
  Scripts nested too deep

Scripts can be read with the "-s" command-line argument and with the ":source"
command.  The script can then again read another script.  This can continue
for about 14 levels.  When more nesting is done, Vim assumes that there is a
recursive loop somewhere and stops with this error message.

							*E319*  >
  Sorry, the command is not available in this version

You have used a command that is not present in the version of Vim you are
using.  When compiling Vim, many different features can be enabled or
disabled.  This depends on how big Vim has chosen to be and the operating
system.  See |+feature-list| for when which feature is available.  The
|:version| command shows which feature Vim was compiled with.

							*E300*  >
  Swap file already exists (symlink attack?)

This message appears when Vim is trying to open a swap file and finds it
already exists or finds a symbolic link in its place.  This shouldn't happen,
because Vim already checked that the file doesn't exist.  Either someone else
opened the same file at exactly the same moment (very unlikely) or someone is
attempting a symlink attack (could happen when editing a file in /tmp or when
'directory' starts with "/tmp", which is a bad choice).

							*E432*  >
  Tags file not sorted: {file name}

Vim (and Vi) expect tags files to be sorted in ASCII order.  Binary searching
can then be used, which is a lot faster than a linear search.  If your tags
files are not properly sorted, reset the |'tagbsearch'| option.
This message is only given when Vim detects a problem when searching for a
tag.  Sometimes this message is not given, even though the tags file is not
properly sorted.

							*E460*  >
  The resource fork would be lost (add ! to override)

On the Macintosh (classic), when writing a file, Vim attempts to preserve all
info about a file, including its resource fork.  If this is not possible you
get this error message.  Append "!" to the command name to write anyway (and
lose the info).

							*E424*  >
  Too many different highlighting attributes in use

Vim can only handle about 223 different kinds of highlighting.  If you run
into this limit, you have used too many |:highlight| commands with different
arguments.  A ":highlight link" is not counted.

							*E77*  >
  Too many file names

When expanding file names, more than one match was found.  Only one match is
allowed for the command that was used.

							*E303*  >
  Unable to open swap file for "{filename}", recovery impossible

Vim was not able to create a swap file.  You can still edit the file, but if
Vim unexpectedly exits the changes will be lost.  And Vim may consume a lot of
memory when editing a big file.  You may want to change the 'directory' option
to avoid this error.  See |swap-file|.

							*E140*  >
  Use ! to write partial buffer

When using a range to write part of a buffer, it is unusual to overwrite the
original file.  It is probably a mistake (e.g., when Visual mode was active
when using ":w"), therefore Vim requires using a !  after the command, e.g.:
":3,10w!".
>

  Warning: Cannot convert string "<Key>Escape,_Key_Cancel" to type
  VirtualBinding

Messages like this appear when starting up.  This is not a Vim problem, your
X11 configuration is wrong.  You can find a hint on how to solve this here:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/solarisonintel/message/12179.
[this URL is no longer valid]

							*W10*  >
  Warning: Changing a readonly file

The file is read-only and you are making a change to it anyway.  You can use
the |FileChangedRO| autocommand event to avoid this message (the autocommand
must reset the 'readonly' option).  See 'modifiable' to completely disallow
making changes to a file.
This message is only given for the first change after 'readonly' has been set.

							*W13*  >
  Warning: File "{filename}" has been created after editing started

You are editing a file in Vim when it didn't exist, but it does exist now.
You will have to decide if you want to keep the version in Vim or the newly
created file.  This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

							*W11*  >
  Warning: File "{filename}" has changed since editing started

The file which you have started editing has got another timestamp and the
contents changed (more precisely: When reading the file again with the current
option settings and autocommands you would end up with different text).  This
probably means that some other program changed the file.  You will have to
find out what happened, and decide which version of the file you want to keep.
Set the 'autoread' option if you want to do this automatically.
This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

There is one situation where you get this message even though there is nothing
wrong: If you save a file in Windows on the day the daylight saving time
starts.  It can be fixed in one of these ways:
- Add this line in your autoexec.bat: >
	   SET TZ=-1
< Adjust the "-1" for your time zone.
- Disable "automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes".
- Just write the file again the next day.  Or set your clock to the next day,
  write the file twice and set the clock back.

							*W12*  >
  Warning: File "{filename}" has changed and the buffer was changed in Vim as well

Like the above, and the buffer for the file was changed in this Vim as well.
You will have to decide if you want to keep the version in this Vim or the one
on disk.  This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

							*W16*  >
  Warning: Mode of file "{filename}" has changed since editing started

When the timestamp for a buffer was changed and the contents are still the
same but the mode (permissions) have changed.  This usually occurs when
checking out a file from a version control system, which causes the read-only
bit to be reset.  It should be safe to reload the file.  Set 'autoread' to
automatically reload the file.

							*E211*  >
  File "{filename}" no longer available

The file which you have started editing has disappeared, or is no longer
accessible.  Make sure you write the buffer somewhere to avoid losing
changes.  This message is not given when 'buftype' is not empty.

							*W14*  >
  Warning: List of file names overflow

You must be using an awful lot of buffers.  It's now possible that two buffers
have the same number, which causes various problems.  You might want to exit
Vim and restart it.

							*E931*  >
  Buffer cannot be registered

Out of memory or a duplicate buffer number.  May happen after W14.  Looking up
a buffer will not always work, better restart Vim.

							*E296* *E297*  >
  Seek error in swap file write
  Write error in swap file

This mostly happens when the disk is full.  Vim could not write text into the
|swap-file|.  It's not directly harmful, but when Vim unexpectedly exits some
text may be lost without recovery being possible.  Vim might run out of memory
when this problem persists.

						*connection-refused*  >
  Xlib: connection to "<machine-name:0.0" refused by server

This happens when Vim tries to connect to the X server, but the X server does
not allow a connection.  The connection to the X server is needed to be able
to restore the title and for the xterm clipboard support.  Unfortunately this
error message cannot be avoided, except by disabling the |+xterm_clipboard|
and |+X11| features.

							*E10*  >
  \\ should be followed by /, ? or &

A command line started with a backslash or the range of a command contained a
backslash in a wrong place.  This is often caused by command-line continuation
being disabled.  Remove the 'C' flag from the 'cpoptions' option to enable it.
Or use ":set nocp".

							*E471*  >
  Argument required

This happens when an Ex command with mandatory argument(s) was executed, but
no argument has been specified.

							*E474* *E475*  >
  Invalid argument
  Invalid argument: {arg}

An Ex command has been executed, but an invalid argument has been specified.

							*E488*  >
  Trailing characters

An argument has been added to an Ex command that does not permit one.

							*E477* *E478*  >
  No ! allowed
  Don't panic!

You have added a "!" after an Ex command that doesn't permit one.

							*E481*  >
  No range allowed

A range was specified for an Ex command that doesn't permit one.  See
|cmdline-ranges|.

							*E482* *E483*  >
  Can't create file {filename}
  Can't get temp file name

Vim cannot create a temporary file.

							*E484* *E485*  >
  Can't open file {filename}
  Can't read file {filename}

Vim cannot read a temporary file.  Especially on Windows, this can be caused
by wrong escaping of special characters for cmd.exe; the approach was
changed with patch 7.3.443.  Try using |shellescape()| for all shell arguments
given to |system()|, or explicitly add escaping with ^.  Also see
'shellxquote' and 'shellxescape'.

							*E464*  >
  Ambiguous use of user-defined command

There are two user-defined commands with a common name prefix, and you used
Command-line completion to execute one of them. |user-cmd-ambiguous|
Example: >
	:command MyCommand1 echo "one"
	:command MyCommand2 echo "two"
	:MyCommand
<
							*E492*  >
  Not an editor command

You tried to execute a command that is neither an Ex command nor
a user-defined command.

==============================================================================
3. Messages						*messages*

This is an (incomplete) overview of various messages that Vim gives:

			*hit-enter* *press-enter* *hit-return*
			*press-return* *hit-enter-prompt*

  Press ENTER or type command to continue

This message is given when there is something on the screen for you to read,
and the screen is about to be redrawn:
- After executing an external command (e.g., ":!ls" and "=").
- Something is displayed on the status line that is longer than the width of
  the window, or runs into the 'showcmd' or 'ruler' output.

-> Press <Enter> or <Space> to redraw the screen and continue, without that
   key being used otherwise.
-> Press ':' or any other Normal mode command character to start that command.
-> Press 'k', <Up>, 'u', 'b' or 'g' to scroll back in the messages.  This
   works the same way as at the |more-prompt|.  Only works when 'compatible'
   is off and 'more' is on.
-> Pressing 'j', 'f', 'd' or <Down> is ignored when messages scrolled off the
   top of the screen, 'compatible' is off and 'more' is on, to avoid that
   typing one 'j' or 'f' too many causes the messages to disappear.
-> Press <C-Y> to copy (yank) a modeless selection to the clipboard register.
-> Use a menu.  The characters defined for Cmdline-mode are used.
-> When 'mouse' contains the 'r' flag, clicking the left mouse button works
   like pressing <Space>.  This makes it impossible to select text though.
-> For the GUI clicking the left mouse button in the last line works like
   pressing <Space>.
{Vi: only ":" commands are interpreted}

If you accidentally hit <Enter> or <Space> and you want to see the displayed
text then use |g<|.  This only works when 'more' is set.

To reduce the number of hit-enter prompts:
- Set 'cmdheight' to 2 or higher.
- Add flags to 'shortmess'.
- Reset 'showcmd' and/or 'ruler'.

If your script causes the hit-enter prompt and you don't know why, you may
find the |v:scrollstart| variable useful.

Also see 'mouse'.  The hit-enter message is highlighted with the |hl-Question|
group.


						*more-prompt* *pager*  >
  -- More --
  -- More -- SPACE/d/j: screen/page/line down, b/u/k: up, q: quit

This message is given when the screen is filled with messages.  It is only
given when the 'more' option is on.  It is highlighted with the |hl-MoreMsg|
group.

Type					effect ~
     <CR> or <NL> or j or <Down>	one more line
     d					down a page (half a screen)
     <Space> or f or <PageDown>		down a screen
     G					down all the way, until the hit-enter
					prompt

     <BS> or k or <Up>			one line back (*)
     u					up a page (half a screen) (*)
     b or <PageUp>			back a screen (*)
     g					back to the start (*)

     q, <Esc> or CTRL-C			stop the listing
     :					stop the listing and enter a
					     command-line
    <C-Y>				yank (copy) a modeless selection to
					the clipboard ("* and "+ registers)
    {menu-entry}			what the menu is defined to in
					Cmdline-mode.
    <LeftMouse> (**)			next page

Any other key causes the meaning of the keys to be displayed.

(*)  backwards scrolling is {not in Vi}.  Only scrolls back to where messages
     started to scroll.
(**) Clicking the left mouse button only works:
     - For the GUI: in the last line of the screen.
     - When 'r' is included in 'mouse' (but then selecting text won't work).


Note: The typed key is directly obtained from the terminal, it is not mapped
and typeahead is ignored.

The |g<| command can be used to see the last page of previous command output.
This is especially useful if you accidentally typed <Space> at the hit-enter
prompt.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Multi-language features				*multilang* *multi-lang*

This is about using messages and menus in various languages.  For editing
multi-byte text see |multibyte|.

The basics are explained in the user manual: |usr_45.txt|.

1. Messages			|multilang-messages|
2. Menus			|multilang-menus|
3. Scripts			|multilang-scripts|

Also see |help-translated| for multi-language help.

{Vi does not have any of these features}
{not available when compiled without the |+multi_lang| feature}

==============================================================================
1. Messages						*multilang-messages*

Vim picks up the locale from the environment.  In most cases this means Vim
will use the language that you prefer, unless it's not available.

To see a list of supported locale names on your system, look in one of these
directories (for Unix):
	/usr/lib/locale ~
	/usr/share/locale ~
Unfortunately, upper/lowercase differences matter.  Also watch out for the
use of "-" and "_".

					    *:lan* *:lang* *:language* *E197*
:lan[guage]
:lan[guage] mes[sages]
:lan[guage] cty[pe]
:lan[guage] tim[e]
			Print the current language (aka locale).
			With the "messages" argument the language used for
			messages is printed.  Technical: LC_MESSAGES.
			With the "ctype" argument the language used for
			character encoding is printed.  Technical: LC_CTYPE.
			With the "time" argument the language used for
			strftime() is printed.  Technical: LC_TIME.
			Without argument all parts of the locale are printed
			(this is system dependent).
			The current language can also be obtained with the
			|v:lang|, |v:ctype| and |v:lc_time| variables.

:lan[guage] {name}
:lan[guage] mes[sages] {name}
:lan[guage] cty[pe] {name}
:lan[guage] tim[e] {name}
			Set the current language (aka locale) to {name}.
			The locale {name} must be a valid locale on your
			system.  Some systems accept aliases like "en" or
			"en_US", but some only accept the full specification
			like "en_US.ISO_8859-1".  On Unix systems you can use
			this command to see what locales are supported: >
				:!locale -a
<			With the "messages" argument the language used for
			messages is set.  This can be different when you want,
			for example, English messages while editing Japanese
			text.  This sets $LC_MESSAGES.
			With the "ctype" argument the language used for
			character encoding is set.  This affects the libraries
			that Vim was linked with.  It's unusual to set this to
			a different value from 'encoding' or "C".  This sets
			$LC_CTYPE.
			With the "time" argument the language used for time
			and date messages is set.  This affects strftime().
			This sets $LC_TIME.
			Without an argument both are set, and additionally
			$LANG is set.
			When compiled with the |+float| feature the LC_NUMERIC
			value will always be set to "C", so that floating
			point numbers use '.' as the decimal point.
			This will make a difference for items that depend on
			the language (some messages, time and date format).
			Not fully supported on all systems
			If this fails there will be an error message.  If it
			succeeds there is no message.  Example: >
				:language
				Current language: C
				:language de_DE.ISO_8859-1
				:language mes
				Current messages language: de_DE.ISO_8859-1
				:lang mes en
<

MS-WINDOWS MESSAGE TRANSLATIONS				*win32-gettext*

If you used the self-installing .exe file, message translations should work
already.  Otherwise get the libintl.dll file if you don't have it yet:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gettext
Or:
	https://mlocati.github.io/gettext-iconv-windows/

This also contains tools xgettext, msgformat and others.

libintl.dll should be placed in same directory with (g)vim.exe, or some
place where PATH environment value describe.  Vim also finds libintl-8.dll.
Message files (vim.mo) have to be placed in "$VIMRUNTIME/lang/xx/LC_MESSAGES",
where "xx" is the abbreviation of the language (mostly two letters).

If you write your own translations you need to generate the .po file and
convert it to a .mo file.  You need to get the source distribution and read
the file "src/po/README.txt".

To overrule the automatic choice of the language, set the $LANG variable to
the language of your choice.  use "en" to disable translations. >

  :let $LANG = 'ja'

(text for Windows by Muraoka Taro)

==============================================================================
2. Menus						*multilang-menus*

See |45.2| for the basics, esp. using 'langmenu'.

Note that if changes have been made to the menus after the translation was
done, some of the menus may be shown in English.  Please try contacting the
maintainer of the translation and ask him to update it.  You can find the
name and e-mail address of the translator in
"$VIMRUNTIME/lang/menu_<lang>.vim".

To set the font (or fontset) to use for the menus, use the |:highlight|
command.  Example: >

	:highlight Menu font=k12,r12


ALIAS LOCALE NAMES

Unfortunately, the locale names are different on various systems, even though
they are for the same language and encoding.  If you do not get the menu
translations you expected, check the output of this command: >

	echo v:lang

Now check the "$VIMRUNTIME/lang" directory for menu translation files that use
a similar language.  A difference in a "-" being a "_" already causes a file
not to be found!  Another common difference to watch out for is "iso8859-1"
versus "iso_8859-1".  Fortunately Vim makes all names lowercase, thus you
don't have to worry about case differences.  Spaces are changed to
underscores, to avoid having to escape them.

If you find a menu translation file for your language with a different name,
create a file in your own runtime directory to load that one.  The name of
that file could be: >

	~/.vim/lang/menu_<v:lang>.vim

Check the 'runtimepath' option for directories which are searched.  In that
file put a command to load the menu file with the other name: >

	runtime lang/menu_<other_lang>.vim


TRANSLATING MENUS

If you want to do your own translations, you can use the |:menutrans| command,
explained below.  It is recommended to put the translations for one language
in a Vim script.  For a language that has no translation yet, please consider
becoming the maintainer and make your translations available to all Vim users.
Send an e-mail to the Vim maintainer <maintainer@vim.org>.

					*:menut* *:menutrans* *:menutranslate*
:menut[ranslate] clear
			Clear all menu translations.

:menut[ranslate] {english} {mylang}
			Translate menu name {english} to {mylang}.  All
			special characters like "&" and "<Tab>" need to be
			included.  Spaces and dots need to be escaped with a
			backslash, just like in other |:menu| commands.

See the $VIMRUNTIME/lang directory for examples.

To try out your translations you first have to remove all menus.  This is how
you can do it without restarting Vim: >
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
	:source <your-new-menu-file>
	:source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim

Each part of a menu path is translated separately.  The result is that when
"Help" is translated to "Hilfe" and "Overview" to "berblick" then
"Help.Overview" will be translated to "Hilfe.berblick".

3. Scripts						*multilang-scripts*

In Vim scripts you can use the |v:lang| variable to get the current language
(locale).  The default value is "C" or comes from the $LANG environment
variable.

The following example shows how this variable is used in a simple way, to make
a message adapt to language preferences of the user, >

	:if v:lang =~ "de_DE"
	:  echo "Guten Morgen"
	:else
	:  echo "Good morning"
	:endif

Cursor motions					*cursor-motions* *navigation*

These commands move the cursor position.  If the new position is off of the
screen, the screen is scrolled to show the cursor (see also 'scrolljump' and
'scrolloff' options).

1. Motions and operators	|operator|
2. Left-right motions		|left-right-motions|
3. Up-down motions		|up-down-motions|
4. Word motions			|word-motions|
5. Text object motions		|object-motions|
6. Text object selection	|object-select|
7. Marks			|mark-motions|
8. Jumps			|jump-motions|
9. Various motions		|various-motions|

General remarks:

If you want to know where you are in the file use the "CTRL-G" command
|CTRL-G| or the "g CTRL-G" command |g_CTRL-G|.  If you set the 'ruler' option,
the cursor position is continuously shown in the status line (which slows down
Vim a little).

Experienced users prefer the hjkl keys because they are always right under
their fingers.  Beginners often prefer the arrow keys, because they do not
know what the hjkl keys do.  The mnemonic value of hjkl is clear from looking
at the keyboard.  Think of j as an arrow pointing downwards.

The 'virtualedit' option can be set to make it possible to move the cursor to
positions where there is no character or halfway a character.

==============================================================================
1. Motions and operators				*operator*

The motion commands can be used after an operator command, to have the command
operate on the text that was moved over.  That is the text between the cursor
position before and after the motion.  Operators are generally used to delete
or change text.  The following operators are available:

	|c|	c	change
	|d|	d	delete
	|y|	y	yank into register (does not change the text)
	|~|	~	swap case (only if 'tildeop' is set)
	|g~|	g~	swap case
	|gu|	gu	make lowercase
	|gU|	gU	make uppercase
	|!|	!	filter through an external program
	|=|	=	filter through 'equalprg' or C-indenting if empty
	|gq|	gq	text formatting
	|g?|	g?	ROT13 encoding
	|>|	>	shift right
	|<|	<	shift left
	|zf|	zf	define a fold
	|g@|	g@	call function set with the 'operatorfunc' option

If the motion includes a count and the operator also had a count before it,
the two counts are multiplied.  For example: "2d3w" deletes six words.

After applying the operator the cursor is mostly left at the start of the text
that was operated upon.  For example, "yfe" doesn't move the cursor, but "yFe"
moves the cursor leftwards to the "e" where the yank started.

						*linewise* *characterwise*
The operator either affects whole lines, or the characters between the start
and end position.  Generally, motions that move between lines affect lines
(are linewise), and motions that move within a line affect characters (are
characterwise).  However, there are some exceptions.

						*exclusive* *inclusive*
A character motion is either inclusive or exclusive.  When inclusive, the
start and end position of the motion are included in the operation.  When
exclusive, the last character towards the end of the buffer is not included.
Linewise motions always include the start and end position.

Which motions are linewise, inclusive or exclusive is mentioned with the
command.  There are however, two general exceptions:
1. If the motion is exclusive and the end of the motion is in column 1, the
   end of the motion is moved to the end of the previous line and the motion
   becomes inclusive.  Example: "}" moves to the first line after a paragraph,
   but "d}" will not include that line.
						*exclusive-linewise*
2. If the motion is exclusive, the end of the motion is in column 1 and the
   start of the motion was at or before the first non-blank in the line, the
   motion becomes linewise.  Example: If a paragraph begins with some blanks
   and you do "d}" while standing on the first non-blank, all the lines of
   the paragraph are deleted, including the blanks.  If you do a put now, the
   deleted lines will be inserted below the cursor position.

Note that when the operator is pending (the operator command is typed, but the
motion isn't yet), a special set of mappings can be used.  See |:omap|.

Instead of first giving the operator and then a motion you can use Visual
mode: mark the start of the text with "v", move the cursor to the end of the
text that is to be affected and then hit the operator.  The text between the
start and the cursor position is highlighted, so you can see what text will
be operated upon.  This allows much more freedom, but requires more key
strokes and has limited redo functionality.  See the chapter on Visual mode
|Visual-mode|.

You can use a ":" command for a motion.  For example "d:call FindEnd()".
But this can't be repeated with "." if the command is more than one line.
This can be repeated: >
	d:call search("f")<CR>
This cannot be repeated: >
	d:if 1<CR>
	   call search("f")<CR>
	endif<CR>
Note that when using ":" any motion becomes characterwise exclusive.


FORCING A MOTION TO BE LINEWISE, CHARACTERWISE OR BLOCKWISE

When a motion is not of the type you would like to use, you can force another
type by using "v", "V" or CTRL-V just after the operator.
Example: >
	dj
deletes two lines >
	dvj
deletes from the cursor position until the character below the cursor >
	d<C-V>j
deletes the character under the cursor and the character below the cursor. >

Be careful with forcing a linewise movement to be used characterwise or
blockwise, the column may not always be defined.

							*o_v*
v		When used after an operator, before the motion command: Force
		the operator to work characterwise, also when the motion is
		linewise.  If the motion was linewise, it will become
		|exclusive|.
		If the motion already was characterwise, toggle
		inclusive/exclusive.  This can be used to make an exclusive
		motion inclusive and an inclusive motion exclusive.

							*o_V*
V		When used after an operator, before the motion command: Force
		the operator to work linewise, also when the motion is
		characterwise.

							*o_CTRL-V*
CTRL-V		When used after an operator, before the motion command: Force
		the operator to work blockwise.  This works like Visual block
		mode selection, with the corners defined by the cursor
		position before and after the motion.

==============================================================================
2. Left-right motions					*left-right-motions*

These commands move the cursor to the specified column in the current line.
They stop at the first column and at the end of the line, except "$", which
may move to one of the next lines.  See 'whichwrap' option to make some of the
commands move across line boundaries.

h		or					*h*
<Left>		or					*<Left>*
CTRL-H		or					*CTRL-H* *<BS>*
<BS>			[count] characters to the left.  |exclusive| motion.
			Note: If you prefer <BS> to delete a character, use
			the mapping:
				:map CTRL-V<BS>		X
			(to enter "CTRL-V<BS>" type the CTRL-V key, followed
			by the <BS> key)
			See |:fixdel| if the <BS> key does not do what you
			want.

l		or					*l*
<Right>		or					*<Right>* *<Space>*
<Space>			[count] characters to the right.  |exclusive| motion.
			See the 'whichwrap' option for adjusting the behavior
			at end of line

							*0*
0			To the first character of the line.  |exclusive|
			motion.

							*<Home>* *<kHome>*
<Home>			To the first character of the line.  |exclusive|
			motion.  When moving up or down next, stay in same
			TEXT column (if possible).  Most other commands stay
			in the same SCREEN column.  <Home> works like "1|",
			which differs from "0" when the line starts with a
			<Tab>.  {not in Vi}

							*^*
^			To the first non-blank character of the line.
			|exclusive| motion.

							*$* *<End>* *<kEnd>*
$  or <End>		To the end of the line.  When a count is given also go
			[count - 1] lines downward |inclusive|.
			In Visual mode the cursor goes to just after the last
			character in the line.
			When 'virtualedit' is active, "$" may move the cursor
			back from past the end of the line to the last
			character in the line.

							*g_*
g_			To the last non-blank character of the line and
			[count - 1] lines downward |inclusive|. {not in Vi}

							*g0* *g<Home>*
g0 or g<Home>		When lines wrap ('wrap' on): To the first character of
			the screen line.  |exclusive| motion.  Differs from
			"0" when a line is wider than the screen.
			When lines don't wrap ('wrap' off): To the leftmost
			character of the current line that is on the screen.
			Differs from "0" when the first character of the line
			is not on the screen.  {not in Vi}

							*g^*
g^			When lines wrap ('wrap' on): To the first non-blank
			character of the screen line.  |exclusive| motion.
			Differs from "^" when a line is wider than the screen.
			When lines don't wrap ('wrap' off): To the leftmost
			non-blank character of the current line that is on the
			screen.  Differs from "^" when the first non-blank
			character of the line is not on the screen.  {not in
			Vi}

							*gm*
gm			Like "g0", but half a screenwidth to the right (or as
			much as possible). {not in Vi}

							*g$* *g<End>*
g$ or g<End>		When lines wrap ('wrap' on): To the last character of
			the screen line and [count - 1] screen lines downward
			|inclusive|.  Differs from "$" when a line is wider
			than the screen.
			When lines don't wrap ('wrap' off): To the rightmost
			character of the current line that is visible on the
			screen.  Differs from "$" when the last character of
			the line is not on the screen or when a count is used.
			Additionally, vertical movements keep the column,
			instead of going to the end of the line.
			When 'virtualedit' is enabled moves to the end of the
			screen line.
			{not in Vi}

							*bar*
|			To screen column [count] in the current line.
			|exclusive| motion.  Ceci n'est pas une pipe.

							*f*
f{char}			To [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the right.  The
			cursor is placed on {char} |inclusive|.
			{char} can be entered as a digraph |digraph-arg|.
			When 'encoding' is set to Unicode, composing
			characters may be used, see |utf-8-char-arg|.
			|:lmap| mappings apply to {char}.  The CTRL-^ command
			in Insert mode can be used to switch this on/off
			|i_CTRL-^|.

							*F*
F{char}			To the [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the left.
			The cursor is placed on {char} |exclusive|.
			{char} can be entered like with the |f| command.

							*t*
t{char}			Till before [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the
			right.  The cursor is placed on the character left of
			{char} |inclusive|.
			{char} can be entered like with the |f| command.

							*T*
T{char}			Till after [count]'th occurrence of {char} to the
			left.  The cursor is placed on the character right of
			{char} |exclusive|.
			{char} can be entered like with the |f| command.

							*;*
;			Repeat latest f, t, F or T [count] times. See |cpo-;|

							*,*
,			Repeat latest f, t, F or T in opposite direction
			[count] times. See also |cpo-;|

==============================================================================
3. Up-down motions					*up-down-motions*

k		or					*k*
<Up>		or					*<Up>* *CTRL-P*
CTRL-P			[count] lines upward |linewise|.

j		or					*j*
<Down>		or					*<Down>*
CTRL-J		or					*CTRL-J*
<NL>		or					*<NL>* *CTRL-N*
CTRL-N			[count] lines downward |linewise|.

gk		or					*gk* *g<Up>*
g<Up>			[count] display lines upward.  |exclusive| motion.
			Differs from 'k' when lines wrap, and when used with
			an operator, because it's not linewise.  {not in Vi}

gj		or					*gj* *g<Down>*
g<Down>			[count] display lines downward.  |exclusive| motion.
			Differs from 'j' when lines wrap, and when used with
			an operator, because it's not linewise.  {not in Vi}

							*-*
-  <minus>		[count] lines upward, on the first non-blank
			character |linewise|.

+		or					*+*
CTRL-M		or					*CTRL-M* *<CR>*
<CR>			[count] lines downward, on the first non-blank
			character |linewise|.

							*_*
_  <underscore>		[count] - 1 lines downward, on the first non-blank
			character |linewise|.

							*G*
G			Goto line [count], default last line, on the first
			non-blank character |linewise|.  If 'startofline' not
			set, keep the same column.
			G is a one of |jump-motions|.

							*<C-End>*
<C-End>			Goto line [count], default last line, on the last
			character |inclusive|. {not in Vi}

<C-Home>	or					*gg* *<C-Home>*
gg			Goto line [count], default first line, on the first
			non-blank character |linewise|.  If 'startofline' not
			set, keep the same column.

							*:[range]*
:[range]		Set the cursor on the last line number in [range].
			[range] can also be just one line number, e.g., ":1"
			or ":'m".
			In contrast with |G| this command does not modify the
			|jumplist|.
							*N%*
{count}%		Go to {count} percentage in the file, on the first
			non-blank in the line |linewise|.  To compute the new
			line number this formula is used:
			    ({count} * number-of-lines + 99) / 100
			See also 'startofline' option.  {not in Vi}

:[range]go[to] [count]					*:go* *:goto* *go*
[count]go		Go to [count] byte in the buffer.  Default [count] is
			one, start of the file.  When giving [range], the
			last number in it used as the byte count.  End-of-line
			characters are counted depending on the current
			'fileformat' setting.
			Also see the |line2byte()| function, and the 'o'
			option in 'statusline'.
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+byte_offset| feature}

These commands move to the specified line.  They stop when reaching the first
or the last line.  The first two commands put the cursor in the same column
(if possible) as it was after the last command that changed the column,
except after the "$" command, then the cursor will be put on the last
character of the line.

If "k", "-" or CTRL-P is used with a [count] and there are less than [count]
lines above the cursor and the 'cpo' option includes the "-" flag it is an
error. |cpo--|.

==============================================================================
4. Word motions						*word-motions*

<S-Right>	or					*<S-Right>* *w*
w			[count] words forward.  |exclusive| motion.

<C-Right>	or					*<C-Right>* *W*
W			[count] WORDS forward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*e*
e			Forward to the end of word [count] |inclusive|.
			Does not stop in an empty line.

							*E*
E			Forward to the end of WORD [count] |inclusive|.
			Does not stop in an empty line.

<S-Left>	or					*<S-Left>* *b*
b			[count] words backward.  |exclusive| motion.

<C-Left>	or					*<C-Left>* *B*
B			[count] WORDS backward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*ge*
ge			Backward to the end of word [count] |inclusive|.

							*gE*
gE			Backward to the end of WORD [count] |inclusive|.

These commands move over words or WORDS.
							*word*
A word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a
sequence of other non-blank characters, separated with white space (spaces,
tabs, <EOL>).  This can be changed with the 'iskeyword' option.  An empty line
is also considered to be a word.
							*WORD*
A WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white
space.  An empty line is also considered to be a WORD.

A sequence of folded lines is counted for one word of a single character.
"w" and "W", "e" and "E" move to the start/end of the first word or WORD after
a range of folded lines.  "b" and "B" move to the start of the first word or
WORD before the fold.

Special case: "cw" and "cW" are treated like "ce" and "cE" if the cursor is
on a non-blank.  This is because "cw" is interpreted as change-word, and a
word does not include the following white space.  {Vi: "cw" when on a blank
followed by other blanks changes only the first blank; this is probably a
bug, because "dw" deletes all the blanks}

Another special case: When using the "w" motion in combination with an
operator and the last word moved over is at the end of a line, the end of
that word becomes the end of the operated text, not the first word in the
next line.

The original Vi implementation of "e" is buggy.  For example, the "e" command
will stop on the first character of a line if the previous line was empty.
But when you use "2e" this does not happen.  In Vim "ee" and "2e" are the
same, which is more logical.  However, this causes a small incompatibility
between Vi and Vim.

==============================================================================
5. Text object motions					*object-motions*

							*(*
(			[count] sentences backward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*)*
)			[count] sentences forward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*{*
{			[count] paragraphs backward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*}*
}			[count] paragraphs forward.  |exclusive| motion.

							*]]*
]]			[count] sections forward or to the next '{' in the
			first column.  When used after an operator, then also
			stops below a '}' in the first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

							*][*
][			[count] sections forward or to the next '}' in the
			first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

							*[[*
[[			[count] sections backward or to the previous '{' in
			the first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

							*[]*
[]			[count] sections backward or to the previous '}' in
			the first column.  |exclusive|
			Note that |exclusive-linewise| often applies.

These commands move over three kinds of text objects.

							*sentence*
A sentence is defined as ending at a '.', '!' or '?' followed by either the
end of a line, or by a space or tab.  Any number of closing ')', ']', '"'
and ''' characters may appear after the '.', '!' or '?' before the spaces,
tabs or end of line.  A paragraph and section boundary is also a sentence
boundary.
If the 'J' flag is present in 'cpoptions', at least two spaces have to
follow the punctuation mark; <Tab>s are not recognized as white space.
The definition of a sentence cannot be changed.

							*paragraph*
A paragraph begins after each empty line, and also at each of a set of
paragraph macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the 'paragraphs'
option.  The default is "IPLPPPQPP TPHPLIPpLpItpplpipbp", which corresponds to
the macros ".IP", ".LP", etc.  (These are nroff macros, so the dot must be in
the first column).  A section boundary is also a paragraph boundary.
Note that a blank line (only containing white space) is NOT a paragraph
boundary.
Also note that this does not include a '{' or '}' in the first column.  When
the '{' flag is in 'cpoptions' then '{' in the first column is used as a
paragraph boundary |posix|.

							*section*
A section begins after a form-feed (<C-L>) in the first column and at each of
a set of section macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the
'sections' option.  The default is "SHNHH HUnhsh", which defines a section to
start at the nroff macros ".SH", ".NH", ".H", ".HU", ".nh" and ".sh".

The "]" and "[" commands stop at the '{' or '}' in the first column.  This is
useful to find the start or end of a function in a C program.  Note that the
first character of the command determines the search direction and the
second character the type of brace found.

If your '{' or '}' are not in the first column, and you would like to use "[["
and "]]" anyway, try these mappings: >
   :map [[ ?{<CR>w99[{
   :map ][ /}<CR>b99]}
   :map ]] j0[[%/{<CR>
   :map [] k$][%?}<CR>
[type these literally, see |<>|]

==============================================================================
6. Text object selection			*object-select* *text-objects*
						*v_a* *v_i*

This is a series of commands that can only be used while in Visual mode or
after an operator.  The commands that start with "a" select "a"n object
including white space, the commands starting with "i" select an "inner" object
without white space, or just the white space.  Thus the "inner" commands
always select less text than the "a" commands.

These commands are {not in Vi}.
These commands are not available when the |+textobjects| feature has been
disabled at compile time.
Also see `gn` and `gN`, operating on the last search pattern.

							*v_aw* *aw*
aw			"a word", select [count] words (see |word|).

			counted.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "aw" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

iw			"inner word", select [count] words (see |word|).
			White space between words is counted too.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "iw" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

							*v_aW* *aW*
aW			"a WORD", select [count] WORDs (see |WORD|).
			Leading or trailing white space is included, but not
			counted.
			When used in Visual linewise mode "aW" switches to
			Visual characterwise mode.

							*v_iW* *iW*
iW			"inner WORD", select [count] WORDs (see |WORD|).

a]						*v_a]* *v_a[* *a]* *a[*
a[			"a [] block", select [count] '[' ']' blocks.  This
			goes backwards to the [count] unclosed '[', and finds
			the matching ']'.  The enclosed text is selected,
			including the '[' and ']'.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i]						*v_i]* *v_i[* *i]* *i[*
i[			"inner [] block", select [count] '[' ']' blocks.  This
			goes backwards to the [count] unclosed '[', and finds
			the matching ']'.  The enclosed text is selected,
			excluding the '[' and ']'.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a)							*v_a)* *a)* *a(*
a(							*vab* *v_ab* *v_a(* *ab*
ab			"a block", select [count] blocks, from "[count] [(" to
			the matching ')', including the '(' and ')' (see
			|[(|).  Does not include white space outside of the
			parenthesis.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i)							*v_i)* *i)* *i(*
i(							*vib* *v_ib* *v_i(* *ib*
ib			"inner block", select [count] blocks, from "[count] [("

			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

						*v_it* *it*
it			"inner tag block", select [count] tag blocks, from the
			[count]'th unmatched "<aaa>" backwards to the matching
			"</aaa>", excluding the "<aaa>" and "</aaa>".
			See |tag-blocks| about the details.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a}							*v_a}* *a}* *a{*
a{							*v_aB* *v_a{* *aB*
aB			"a Block", select [count] Blocks, from "[count] [{" to
			the matching '}', including the '{' and '}' (see
			|[{|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

i}							*v_i}* *i}* *i{*
i{							*v_iB* *v_i{* *iB*
iB			"inner Block", select [count] Blocks, from "[count] [{"
			to the matching '}', excluding the '{' and '}' (see
			|[{|).
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.

a"							*v_aquote* *aquote*
a'							*v_a'* *a'*
a`							*v_a`* *a`*
			"a quoted string".  Selects the text from the previous
			quote until the next quote.  The 'quoteescape' option
			is used to skip escaped quotes.
			Only works within one line.
			When the cursor starts on a quote, Vim will figure out
			which quote pairs form a string by searching from the
			start of the line.
			Any trailing white space is included, unless there is
			none, then leading white space is included.
			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.
			Repeating this object in Visual mode another string is
			included.  A count is currently not used.

i"							*v_iquote* *iquote*
i'							*v_i'* *i'*
i`							*v_i`* *i`*
			Like a", a' and a`, but exclude the quotes and
			repeating won't extend the Visual selection.
			Special case: With a count of 2 the quotes are
			included, but no extra white space as with a"/a'/a`.

When used after an operator:
For non-block objects:
	For the "a" commands: The operator applies to the object and the white
	space after the object.  If there is no white space after the object
	or when the cursor was in the white space before the object, the white
	space before the object is included.
	For the "inner" commands: If the cursor was on the object, the
	operator applies to the object.  If the cursor was on white space, the
	operator applies to the white space.
For a block object:
	The operator applies to the block where the cursor is in, or the block
	on which the cursor is on one of the braces.  For the "inner" commands
	the surrounding braces are excluded.  For the "a" commands, the braces
	are included.

When used in Visual mode:
When start and end of the Visual area are the same (just after typing "v"):
	One object is selected, the same as for using an operator.
When start and end of the Visual area are not the same:
	For non-block objects the area is extended by one object or the white
	space up to the next object, or both for the "a" objects.  The
	direction in which this happens depends on which side of the Visual
	area the cursor is.  For the block objects the block is extended one
	level outwards.

For illustration, here is a list of delete commands, grouped from small to big
objects.  Note that for a single character and a whole line the existing vi
movement commands are used.
	"dl"	delete character (alias: "x")		|dl|
	"diw"	delete inner word			*diw*
	"daw"	delete a word				*daw*
	"diW"	delete inner WORD (see |WORD|)		*diW*
	"daW"	delete a WORD (see |WORD|)		*daW*
	"dgn"   delete the next search pattern match    *dgn*
	"dd"	delete one line				|dd|
	"dis"	delete inner sentence			*dis*
	"das"	delete a sentence			*das*
	"dib"	delete inner '(' ')' block		*dib*
	"dab"	delete a '(' ')' block			*dab*
	"dip"	delete inner paragraph			*dip*
	"dap"	delete a paragraph			*dap*
	"diB"	delete inner '{' '}' block		*diB*
	"daB"	delete a '{' '}' block			*daB*

Note the difference between using a movement command and an object.  The
movement command operates from here (cursor position) to where the movement
takes us.  When using an object the whole object is operated upon, no matter
where on the object the cursor is.  For example, compare "dw" and "daw": "dw"
deletes from the cursor position to the start of the next word, "daw" deletes
the word under the cursor and the space after or before it.


Tag blocks						*tag-blocks*

For the "it" and "at" text objects an attempt is done to select blocks between
matching tags for HTML and XML.  But since these are not completely compatible
there are a few restrictions.

The normal method is to select a <tag> until the matching </tag>.  For "at"
the tags are included, for "it" they are excluded.  But when "it" is repeated
the tags will be included (otherwise nothing would change).  Also, "it" used
on a tag block with no contents will select the leading tag.

"<aaa/>" items are skipped.  Case is ignored, also for XML where case does
matter.

In HTML it is possible to have a tag like <br> or <meta ...> without a
matching end tag.  These are ignored.

The text objects are tolerant about mistakes.  Stray end tags are ignored.

==============================================================================
7. Marks					*mark-motions* *E20* *E78*

Jumping to a mark can be done in two ways:
1. With ` (backtick):	  The cursor is positioned at the specified location
			  and the motion is |exclusive|.
2. With ' (single quote): The cursor is positioned on the first non-blank
			  character in the line of the specified location and
			  the motion is linewise.

						*m* *mark* *Mark*
m{a-zA-Z}		Set mark {a-zA-Z} at cursor position (does not move
			the cursor, this is not a motion command).

						*m'* *m`*
m'  or  m`		Set the previous context mark.  This can be jumped to
			with the "''" or "``" command (does not move the
			cursor, this is not a motion command).

						*m[* *m]*
m[  or  m]		Set the |'[| or |']| mark.  Useful when an operator is
			to be simulated by multiple commands.  (does not move
			the cursor, this is not a motion command).

						*m<* *m>*
m<  or  m>		Set the |'<| or |'>| mark.  Useful to change what the
			`gv` command selects.  (does not move the cursor, this
			is not a motion command).
			Note that the Visual mode cannot be set, only the
			start and end position.

						*:ma* *:mark* *E191*
:[range]ma[rk] {a-zA-Z'}
			Set mark {a-zA-Z'} at last line number in [range],
			column 0.  Default is cursor line.

						*:k*
:[range]k{a-zA-Z'}	Same as :mark, but the space before the mark name can
			be omitted.

						*'* *'a* *`* *`a*
'{a-z}  `{a-z}		Jump to the mark {a-z} in the current buffer.

						*'A* *'0* *`A* *`0*
'{A-Z0-9}  `{A-Z0-9}	To the mark {A-Z0-9} in the file where it was set (not
			a motion command when in another file).  {not in Vi}

						*g'* *g'a* *g`* *g`a*
g'{mark}  g`{mark}
			Jump to the {mark}, but don't change the jumplist when
			jumping within the current buffer.  Example: >
				g`"
<			jumps to the last known position in a file.  See
			$VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim.
			Also see |:keepjumps|.
			{not in Vi}

						*:marks*
:marks			List all the current marks (not a motion command).
			The |'(|, |')|, |'{| and |'}| marks are not listed.
			The first column has number zero.
			{not in Vi}
						*E283*
:marks {arg}		List the marks that are mentioned in {arg} (not a
			motion command).  For example: >
				:marks aB
<			to list marks 'a' and 'B'.  {not in Vi}

							*:delm* *:delmarks*
:delm[arks] {marks}	Delete the specified marks.  Marks that can be deleted
			include A-Z and 0-9.  You cannot delete the ' mark.
			They can be specified by giving the list of mark
			names, or with a range, separated with a dash.  Spaces
			are ignored.  Examples: >
			   :delmarks a	      deletes mark a
			   :delmarks a b 1    deletes marks a, b and 1
			   :delmarks Aa       deletes marks A and a
			   :delmarks p-z      deletes marks in the range p to z
			   :delmarks ^.[]     deletes marks ^ . [ ]
			   :delmarks \"	      deletes mark "
<			{not in Vi}

:delm[arks]!		Delete all marks for the current buffer, but not marks
			A-Z or 0-9.
			{not in Vi}

A mark is not visible in any way.  It is just a position in the file that is
remembered.  Do not confuse marks with named registers, they are totally
unrelated.

'a - 'z		lowercase marks, valid within one file
'A - 'Z		uppercase marks, also called file marks, valid between files
'0 - '9		numbered marks, set from .viminfo file

Lowercase marks 'a to 'z are remembered as long as the file remains in the
buffer list.  If you remove the file from the buffer list, all its marks are
lost.  If you delete a line that contains a mark, that mark is erased.

Lowercase marks can be used in combination with operators.  For example: "d't"
deletes the lines from the cursor position to mark 't'.  Hint: Use mark 't' for
Top, 'b' for Bottom, etc..  Lowercase marks are restored when using undo and
redo.

Uppercase marks 'A to 'Z include the file name.  {Vi: no uppercase marks} You
can use them to jump from file to file.  You can only use an uppercase mark
with an operator if the mark is in the current file.  The line number of the
mark remains correct, even if you insert/delete lines or edit another file for
a moment.  When the 'viminfo' option is not empty, uppercase marks are kept in
the .viminfo file.  See |viminfo-file-marks|.

Numbered marks '0 to '9 are quite different.  They can not be set directly.
They are only present when using a viminfo file |viminfo-file|.  Basically '0
is the location of the cursor when you last exited Vim, '1 the last but one
time, etc.  Use the "r" flag in 'viminfo' to specify files for which no
Numbered mark should be stored.  See |viminfo-file-marks|.


							*'[* *`[*
'[  `[			To the first character of the previously changed
			or yanked text.  {not in Vi}

							*']* *`]*
']  `]			To the last character of the previously changed or
			yanked text.  {not in Vi}

After executing an operator the Cursor is put at the beginning of the text
that was operated upon.  After a put command ("p" or "P") the cursor is
sometimes placed at the first inserted line and sometimes on the last inserted
character.  The four commands above put the cursor at either end.  Example:
After yanking 10 lines you want to go to the last one of them: "10Y']".  After
inserting several lines with the "p" command you want to jump to the lowest
inserted line: "p']".  This also works for text that has been inserted.

Note: After deleting text, the start and end positions are the same, except
when using blockwise Visual mode.  These commands do not work when no change
was made yet in the current file.

							*'<* *`<*
'<  `<			To the first line or character of the last selected
			Visual area in the current buffer.  For block mode it
			may also be the last character in the first line (to
			be able to define the block).  {not in Vi}.

							*'>* *`>*
'>  `>			To the last line or character of the last selected
			Visual area in the current buffer.  For block mode it
			may also be the first character of the last line (to
			be able to define the block).  Note that 'selection'
			applies, the position may be just after the Visual
			area.  {not in Vi}.

							*''* *``*
''  ``			To the position before the latest jump, or where the
			last "m'" or "m`" command was given.  Not set when the
			|:keepjumps| command modifier was used.
			Also see |restore-position|.

							*'quote* *`quote*
'"  `"			To the cursor position when last exiting the current
			buffer.  Defaults to the first character of the first
			line.  See |last-position-jump| for how to use this
			for each opened file.
			Only one position is remembered per buffer, not one
			for each window.  As long as the buffer is visible in
			a window the position won't be changed.
			{not in Vi}.

							*'^* *`^*
'^  `^			To the position where the cursor was the last time
			when Insert mode was stopped.  This is used by the
			|gi| command.  Not set when the |:keepjumps| command
			modifier was used.  {not in Vi}

							*'.* *`.*
'.  `.			To the position where the last change was made.  The
			position is at or near where the change started.
			Sometimes a command is executed as several changes,
			then the position can be near the end of what the
			command changed.  For example when inserting a word,
			the position will be on the last character.
			To jump to older changes use |g;|.
			{not in Vi}

							*'(* *`(*
'(  `(			To the start of the current sentence, like the |(|
			command.  {not in Vi}

							*')* *`)*
')  `)			To the end of the current sentence, like the |)|
			command.  {not in Vi}

							*'{* *`{*
'{  `{			To the start of the current paragraph, like the |{|
			command.  {not in Vi}

							*'}* *`}*
'}  `}			To the end of the current paragraph, like the |}|
			command.  {not in Vi}

These commands are not marks themselves, but jump to a mark:

							*]'*
]'			[count] times to next line with a lowercase mark below
			the cursor, on the first non-blank character in the
			line. {not in Vi}

							*]`*
]`			[count] times to lowercase mark after the cursor. {not
			in Vi}

							*['*
['			[count] times to previous line with a lowercase mark
			before the cursor, on the first non-blank character in
			the line. {not in Vi}

							*[`*
[`			[count] times to lowercase mark before the cursor.
			{not in Vi}


:loc[kmarks] {command}					*:loc* *:lockmarks*
			Execute {command} without adjusting marks.  This is
			useful when changing text in a way that the line count
			will be the same when the change has completed.
			WARNING: When the line count does change, marks below
			the change will keep their line number, thus move to
			another text line.
			These items will not be adjusted for deleted/inserted
			lines:
			- lower case letter marks 'a - 'z
			- upper case letter marks 'A - 'Z
			- numbered marks '0 - '9
			- last insert position '^
			- last change position '.
			- the Visual area '< and '>
			- line numbers in placed signs
			- line numbers in quickfix positions
			- positions in the |jumplist|
			- positions in the |tagstack|
			These items will still be adjusted:
			- previous context mark ''
			- the cursor position
			- the view of a window on a buffer
			- folds
			- diffs

:kee[pmarks] {command}					*:kee* *:keepmarks*
			Currently only has effect for the filter command
			|:range!|:
			- When the number of lines after filtering is equal to
			  or larger than before, all marks are kept at the
			  same line number.
			- When the number of lines decreases, the marks in the
			  lines that disappeared are deleted.
			In any case the marks below the filtered text have
			their line numbers adjusted, thus stick to the text,
			as usual.
			When the 'R' flag is missing from 'cpoptions' this has
			the same effect as using ":keepmarks".

							*:keepj* *:keepjumps*
:keepj[umps] {command}
			Moving around in {command} does not change the |''|,
			|'.| and |'^| marks, the |jumplist| or the
			|changelist|.
			Useful when making a change or inserting text
			automatically and the user doesn't want to go to this
			position.  E.g., when updating a "Last change"
			timestamp in the first line: >

				:let lnum = line(".")
				:keepjumps normal gg
				:call SetLastChange()
				:keepjumps exe "normal " . lnum . "G"
<
			Note that ":keepjumps" must be used for every command.
			When invoking a function the commands in that function
			can still change the jumplist.  Also, for
			":keepjumps exe 'command '" the "command" won't keep
			jumps.  Instead use: ":exe 'keepjumps command'"

==============================================================================
8. Jumps					*jump-motions*

A "jump" is one of the following commands: "'", "`", "G", "/", "?", "n",
"N", "%", "(", ")", "[[", "]]", "{", "}", ":s", ":tag", "L", "M", "H" and
the commands that start editing a new file.  If you make the cursor "jump"
with one of these commands, the position of the cursor before the jump is
remembered.  You can return to that position with the "''" and "``" command,
unless the line containing that position was changed or deleted.

							*CTRL-O*
CTRL-O			Go to [count] Older cursor position in jump list
			(not a motion command).
			{not in Vi}
			{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

<Tab>		or					*CTRL-I* *<Tab>*
CTRL-I			Go to [count] newer cursor position in jump list
			(not a motion command).
			{not in Vi}
			{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

							*:ju* *:jumps*
:ju[mps]		Print the jump list (not a motion command).
			{not in Vi}
			{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

							*:cle* *:clearjumps*
:cle[arjumps]		Clear the jump list of the current window.
			{not in Vi}
			{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

							*jumplist*
Jumps are remembered in a jump list.  With the CTRL-O and CTRL-I command you
can go to cursor positions before older jumps, and back again.  Thus you can
move up and down the list.  There is a separate jump list for each window.
The maximum number of entries is fixed at 100.
{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

For example, after three jump commands you have this jump list:

  jump line  col file/text ~
    3	  1    0 some text ~
    2	 70    0 another line ~
    1  1154   23 end. ~
 > ~

The "file/text" column shows the file name, or the text at the jump if it is
in the current file (an indent is removed and a long line is truncated to fit
in the window).

You are currently in line 1167.  If you then use the CTRL-O command, the
cursor is put in line 1154.  This results in:

  jump line  col file/text ~
    2	  1    0 some text ~
    1	 70    0 another line ~
 >  0  1154   23 end. ~
    1  1167    0 foo bar ~

The pointer will be set at the last used jump position.  The next CTRL-O
command will use the entry above it, the next CTRL-I command will use the
entry below it.  If the pointer is below the last entry, this indicates that
you did not use a CTRL-I or CTRL-O before.  In this case the CTRL-O command
will cause the cursor position to be added to the jump list, so you can get
back to the position before the CTRL-O.  In this case this is line 1167.

With more CTRL-O commands you will go to lines 70 and 1.  If you use CTRL-I
you can go back to 1154 and 1167 again.  Note that the number in the "jump"
column indicates the count for the CTRL-O or CTRL-I command that takes you to
this position.

If you use a jump command, the current line number is inserted at the end of
the jump list.  If the same line was already in the jump list, it is removed.
The result is that when repeating CTRL-O you will get back to old positions
only once.

When the |:keepjumps| command modifier is used, jumps are not stored in the
jumplist.  Jumps are also not stored in other cases, e.g., in a |:global|
command.  You can explicitly add a jump by setting the ' mark with "m'".  Note
that calling setpos() does not do this.

After the CTRL-O command that got you into line 1154 you could give another
jump command (e.g., "G").  The jump list would then become:

  jump line  col file/text ~
    4	  1    0 some text ~
    3	 70    0 another line ~
    2  1167    0 foo bar ~
    1  1154   23 end. ~
 > ~

The line numbers will be adjusted for deleted and inserted lines.  This fails
if you stop editing a file without writing, like with ":n!".

When you split a window, the jumplist will be copied to the new window.

If you have included the ' item in the 'viminfo' option the jumplist will be
stored in the viminfo file and restored when starting Vim.


CHANGE LIST JUMPS			*changelist* *change-list-jumps* *E664*

When making a change the cursor position is remembered.  One position is
remembered for every change that can be undone, unless it is close to a
previous change.  Two commands can be used to jump to positions of changes,
also those that have been undone:

							*g;* *E662*
g;			Go to [count] older position in change list.
			If [count] is larger than the number of older change
			positions go to the oldest change.
			If there is no older change an error message is given.
			(not a motion command)
			{not in Vi}
			{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

							*g,* *E663*
g,			Go to [count] newer cursor position in change list.
			Just like |g;| but in the opposite direction.
			(not a motion command)
			{not in Vi}
			{not available without the |+jumplist| feature}

When using a count you jump as far back or forward as possible.  Thus you can
use "999g;" to go to the first change for which the position is still
remembered.  The number of entries in the change list is fixed and is the same
as for the |jumplist|.

When two undo-able changes are in the same line and at a column position less
than 'textwidth' apart only the last one is remembered.  This avoids that a
sequence of small changes in a line, for example "xxxxx", adds many positions
to the change list.  When 'textwidth' is zero 'wrapmargin' is used.  When that
also isn't set a fixed number of 79 is used.  Detail: For the computations
bytes are used, not characters, to avoid a speed penalty (this only matters
for multi-byte encodings).

Note that when text has been inserted or deleted the cursor position might be
a bit different from the position of the change.  Especially when lines have
been deleted.

When the |:keepjumps| command modifier is used the position of a change is not
remembered.

							*:changes*
:changes		Print the change list.  A ">" character indicates the
			current position.  Just after a change it is below the
			newest entry, indicating that "g;" takes you to the
			newest entry position.  The first column indicates the
			count needed to take you to this position.  Example:

				change line  col text ~
				    3     9    8 bla bla bla
				    2    11   57 foo is a bar
				    1    14   54 the latest changed line
				>

			The "3g;" command takes you to line 9.  Then the
			output of ":changes is:

				change line  col text ~
				>   0     9    8 bla bla bla
				    1    11   57 foo is a bar
				    2    14   54 the latest changed line

			Now you can use "g," to go to line 11 and "2g," to go
			to line 14.

==============================================================================
9. Various motions				*various-motions*

							*%*
%			Find the next item in this line after or under the
			cursor and jump to its match. |inclusive| motion.
			Items can be:
			([{}])		parenthesis or (curly/square) brackets
					(this can be changed with the
					'matchpairs' option)
			/* */		start or end of C-style comment
			#if, #ifdef, #else, #elif, #endif
					C preprocessor conditionals (when the
					cursor is on the # or no ([{
					following)
			For other items the matchit plugin can be used, see
			|matchit-install|.  This plugin also helps to skip
			matches in comments.

			When 'cpoptions' contains "M" |cpo-M| backslashes
			before parens and braces are ignored.  Without "M" the
			number of backslashes matters: an even number doesn't
			match with an odd number.  Thus in "( \) )" and "\( (
			\)" the first and last parenthesis match.

			When the '%' character is not present in 'cpoptions'
			|cpo-%|, parens and braces inside double quotes are
			ignored, unless the number of parens/braces in a line
			is uneven and this line and the previous one does not
			end in a backslash.  '(', '{', '[', ']', '}' and ')'
			are also ignored (parens and braces inside single
			quotes).  Note that this works fine for C, but not for
			Perl, where single quotes are used for strings.

			Nothing special is done for matches in comments.  You
			can either use the matchit plugin |matchit-install| or
			put quotes around matches.

			No count is allowed, {count}% jumps to a line {count}
			percentage down the file |N%|.  Using '%' on
			#if/#else/#endif makes the movement linewise.

						*[(*
[(			go to [count] previous unmatched '('.
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

						*[{*
[{			go to [count] previous unmatched '{'.
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

						*])*
])			go to [count] next unmatched ')'.
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

						*]}*
]}			go to [count] next unmatched '}'.
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

The above four commands can be used to go to the start or end of the current
code block.  It is like doing "%" on the '(', ')', '{' or '}' at the other
end of the code block, but you can do this from anywhere in the code block.
Very useful for C programs.  Example: When standing on "case x:", "[{" will
bring you back to the switch statement.

						*]m*
]m			Go to [count] next start of a method (for Java or
			similar structured language).  When not before the
			start of a method, jump to the start or end of the
			class.  When no '{' is found after the cursor, this is
			an error.  |exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}
						*]M*
]M			Go to [count] next end of a method (for Java or
			similar structured language).  When not before the end
			of a method, jump to the start or end of the class.
			When no '}' is found after the cursor, this is an
			error. |exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}
						*[m*
[m			Go to [count] previous start of a method (for Java or
			similar structured language).  When not after the
			start of a method, jump to the start or end of the
			class.  When no '{' is found before the cursor this is
			an error. |exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}
						*[M*
[M			Go to [count] previous end of a method (for Java or
			similar structured language).  When not after the
			end of a method, jump to the start or end of the
			class.  When no '}' is found before the cursor this is
			an error. |exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

The above two commands assume that the file contains a class with methods.
The class definition is surrounded in '{' and '}'.  Each method in the class
is also surrounded with '{' and '}'.  This applies to the Java language.  The
file looks like this: >

	// comment
	class foo {
		int method_one() {
			body_one();
		}
		int method_two() {
			body_two();
		}
	}
Starting with the cursor on "body_two()", using "[m" will jump to the '{' at
the start of "method_two()" (obviously this is much more useful when the
method is long!).  Using "2[m" will jump to the start of "method_one()".
Using "3[m" will jump to the start of the class.

						*[#*
[#			go to [count] previous unmatched "#if" or "#else".
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

						*]#*
]#			go to [count] next unmatched "#else" or "#endif".
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

These two commands work in C programs that contain #if/#else/#endif
constructs.  It brings you to the start or end of the #if/#else/#endif where
the current line is included.  You can then use "%" to go to the matching line.

						*[star* *[/*
[*  or  [/		go to [count] previous start of a C comment "/*".
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}

						*]star* *]/*
]*  or  ]/		go to [count] next end of a C comment "*/".
			|exclusive| motion. {not in Vi}


						*H*
H			To line [count] from top (Home) of window (default:
			first line on the window) on the first non-blank
			character |linewise|.  See also 'startofline' option.
			Cursor is adjusted for 'scrolloff' option.

						*M*
M			To Middle line of window, on the first non-blank
			character |linewise|.  See also 'startofline' option.

						*L*
L			To line [count] from bottom of window (default: Last
			line on the window) on the first non-blank character
			|linewise|.  See also 'startofline' option.
			Cursor is adjusted for 'scrolloff' option.

<LeftMouse>		Moves to the position on the screen where the mouse
			click is |exclusive|.  See also |<LeftMouse>|.  If the
			position is in a status line, that window is made the
			active window and the cursor is not moved.  {not in Vi}

==============================================================================
1. Introduction						*netbeans-intro*

The NetBeans interface was initially developed to integrate Vim into the
NetBeans Java IDE, using the external editor plugin.  This NetBeans plugin no
longer exists for recent versions of NetBeans but the protocol was developed
in such a way that any IDE can use it to integrate Vim.

The NetBeans protocol of Vim is a text based communication protocol, over a
classical TCP socket. There is no dependency on Java or NetBeans. Any language
or environment providing a socket interface can control Vim using this
protocol. There are existing implementations in C, C++, Python and Java. The
name NetBeans is kept today for historical reasons.

Current projects using the NetBeans protocol of Vim are:
- VimIntegration, description of various projects doing Vim Integration:
	http://www.freehackers.org/VimIntegration
- Agide, an IDE for the AAP project, written in Python:
	http://www.a-a-p.org
- Clewn, a gdb integration into Vim, written in C:
	http://clewn.sourceforge.net/
- Pyclewn, a gdb integration into Vim, written in Python:
	http://pyclewn.sourceforge.net/
- VimPlugin, integration of Vim inside Eclipse:
	http://vimplugin.sourceforge.net/wiki/pmwiki.php
- PIDA, IDE written in Python integrating Vim:
	http://pida.co.uk/
- VimWrapper, library to easy Vim integration into IDE:
	http://www.freehackers.org/VimWrapper

Check the specific project pages to see how to use Vim with these projects.

An alternative is to use a channel, see |channel|.

In the rest of this help page, we will use the term "Vim Controller" to
describe the program controlling Vim through the NetBeans socket interface.


About the NetBeans IDE ~

NetBeans is an open source Integrated Development Environment developed
jointly by Sun Microsystems, Inc. and the netbeans.org developer community.
Initially just a Java IDE, NetBeans has had C, C++, and Fortran support added
in recent releases.

For more information visit the main NetBeans web site http://www.netbeans.org.
The External Editor is now, unfortunately, declared obsolete.  See
 http://externaleditor.netbeans.org.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. also ships NetBeans under the name Sun ONE Studio.
Visit http://www.sun.com for more information regarding the Sun ONE Studio
product line.

Current releases of NetBeans provide full support for Java and limited support
for C, C++, and Fortran.  Current releases of Sun ONE Studio provide full
support for Java, C, C++, and Fortran.

==============================================================================
2. Integration features					*netbeans-integration*

The NetBeans socket interface of Vim allows to get information from Vim or to
ask Vim to perform specific actions:
- get information about buffer: buffer name, cursor position, buffer content,
  etc.
- be notified when buffers are open or closed
- be notified of how the buffer content is modified
- load and save files
- modify the buffer content
- installing special key bindings
- raise the window, control the window geometry

For sending key strokes to Vim or for evaluating functions in Vim, you must
use the |clientserver| interface.


==============================================================================
3. Configuring Vim for NetBeans			*netbeans-configure*

For more help about installing Vim, please read |usr_90.txt| in the Vim User
Manual.


On Unix:
--------

When running configure without arguments the NetBeans interface should be
included.  That is, if the configure check to find out if your system supports
the required features succeeds.

In case you do not want the NetBeans interface you can disable it by
uncommenting a line with "--disable-netbeans" in the Makefile.

Currently the NetBeans interface is supported by Vim running in a terminal and
by GVim when it is run with one of the following GUIs: GTK, GNOME, Windows,
Athena and Motif.

If Motif support is required the user must supply XPM libraries.  See
|workshop-xpm| for details on obtaining the latest version of XPM.


On MS-Windows:
--------------

The Win32 support is now in beta stage.

To use XPM signs on Win32 (e.g. when using with NetBeans) you can compile
XPM by yourself or use precompiled libraries from http://iamphet.nm.ru/misc/
(for MS Visual C++) or http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net (for MinGW).

Enable debugging:
-----------------

To enable debugging of Vim and of the NetBeans protocol, the "NBDEBUG" macro
needs to be defined.  Search in the Makefile of the platform you are using for
"NBDEBUG" to see what line needs to be uncommented.  This effectively adds
"-DNBDEBUG" to the compile command.  Also see |netbeans-debugging|

==============================================================================
4. Error Messages					*netbeans-messages*

These error messages are specific to NetBeans socket protocol:

							*E463*
Region is guarded, cannot modify
		The Vim Controller has defined guarded areas in the text,
		which you cannot change.  Also sets the current buffer, if
		necessary.

							*E532*
The defineAnnoType highlighting color name is too long
		The maximum length of the "fg" or "bg" color argument in the
		defineAnnoType command is 32 characters.
		New in version 2.5.

							*E656*
Writes of unmodified buffers forbidden
		Writes of unmodified buffers that were opened from the
		Vim Controller are not possible.

							*E657*
Partial writes disallowed
		Partial writes for buffers that were opened from the
		Vim Controller are not allowed.

							*E658*
Connection lost for this buffer
		The Vim Controller has become confused about the state of
		this file.  Rather than risk data corruption, it has severed
		the connection for this file.  Vim will take over
		responsibility for saving changes to this file and the
		Vim Controller will no longer know of these changes.

							*E744*
Read-only file
		Vim normally allows changes to a read-only file and only
		enforces the read-only rule if you try to write the file.
		However, NetBeans does not let you make changes to a file
		which is read-only and becomes confused if Vim does this.
		So Vim does not allow modifications to files when run
		in NetBeans mode.

==============================================================================
5. Running Vim in NetBeans mode				*netbeans-run*

There are two different ways to run Vim in NetBeans mode:

	+ an IDE may start Vim with the |-nb| command line argument
	+ NetBeans can be started from within Vim with the |:nbstart| command

Vim uses a 3 second timeout on trying to make the connection.

							*netbeans-parameters*
Three forms can be used to setup the NetBeans connection parameters.
When started from the command line, the |-nb| command line argument may be:

	-nb={fname}				from a file
	-nb:{hostname}:{addr}:{password}	directly
	-nb					from a file or environment

When started from within Vim, the |:nbstart| optional argument may be:

	={fname}				from a file
	:{hostname}:{addr}:{password}	        directly
	<MISSING ARGUMENT>			from a file or environment

							*E660* *E668*
When NetBeans is started from the command line, for security reasons, the best
method is to write the information in a file readable only by the user.  The
name of the file can be passed with the "-nb={fname}" argument or, when "-nb"
is used without a parameter, the environment variable "__NETBEANS_CONINFO".
The file must contain these three lines, in any order:

	host={hostname}
	port={addr}
	auth={password}

Other lines are ignored.  The Vim Controller is responsible for deleting the
file afterwards.

{hostname} is the name of the machine where Vim Controller is running.  When
omitted the environment variable "__NETBEANS_HOST" is used or the default
"localhost".

{addr} is the port number for the NetBeans interface.  When omitted the
environment variable "__NETBEANS_SOCKET" is used or the default 3219.

{password} is the password for connecting to NetBeans.  When omitted the
environment variable "__NETBEANS_VIM_PASSWORD" is used or "changeme".

Vim will initiate a socket connection (client side) to the specified host and
port upon startup. The password will be sent with the AUTH event when the
connection has been established.


==============================================================================
6. NetBeans protocol					*netbeans-protocol*

The communication between the Vim Controller and Vim uses plain text
messages.  This protocol was first designed to work with the external editor
module of NetBeans.  Later it was extended to work with Agide (A-A-P GUI IDE,
see http://www.a-a-p.org) and then with other IDE. The extensions are marked
with "version 2.1".

Version 2.2 of the protocol has several minor changes which should only affect
NetBeans users (ie, not Agide users).  However, a bug was fixed which could
cause confusion.  The netbeans_saved() function sent a "save" protocol
command.  In protocol version 2.1 and earlier this was incorrectly interpreted
as a notification that a write had taken place.  In reality, it told NetBeans
to save the file so multiple writes were being done.  This caused various
problems and has been fixed in 2.2.  To decrease the likelihood of this
confusion happening again, netbeans_saved() has been renamed to
netbeans_save_buffer().

We are now at version 2.5.  For the differences between 2.4 and 2.5 search for
"2.5" below.

The messages are currently sent over a socket.  Since the messages are in
plain UTF-8 text this protocol could also be used with any other communication
mechanism.

Netbeans messages are processed when Vim is idle, waiting for user input.
When Vim is run in non-interactive mode, for example when running an automated
test case that sources a Vim script, the idle loop may not be called often
enough. In that case, insert |:sleep| commands in the Vim script. The |:sleep|
command does invoke Netbeans messages processing.

6.1 Kinds of messages		|nb-messages|
6.2 Terms			|nb-terms|
6.3 Commands			|nb-commands|
6.4 Functions and Replies	|nb-functions|
6.5 Events			|nb-events|
6.6 Special messages		|nb-special|
6.7 Protocol errors		|nb-protocol_errors|


6.1 Kinds of messages					*nb-messages*

There are four kinds of messages:

kind		direction	comment ~
Command		IDE -> editor	no reply necessary
Function	IDE -> editor	editor must send back a reply
Reply		editor -> IDE	only in response to a Function
Event		editor -> IDE	no reply necessary

The messages are sent as a single line with a terminating newline character.
Arguments are separated by a single space.  The first item of the message
depends on the kind of message:

kind		first item		example ~
Command		bufID:name!seqno	11:showBalloon!123 "text"
Function	bufID:name/seqno	11:getLength/123
Reply		seqno			123 5000
Event		bufID:name=seqno	11:keyCommand=123 "S-F2"



6.2 Terms						*nb-terms*

bufID		Buffer number.  A message may be either for a specific buffer
		or generic.  Generic messages use a bufID of zero.  NOTE: this
		buffer ID is assigned by the IDE, it is not Vim's buffer
		number.  The bufID must be a sequentially rising number,
		starting at one.  When the 'switchbuf' option is set to
		"usetab" and the "bufID" buffer is not found in the current
		tab page, the netbeans commands and functions that set this
		buffer as the current buffer will jump to the first open
		window that contains this buffer in other tab pages instead of
		replacing the buffer in the current window.

seqno		The IDE uses a sequence number for Commands and Functions.  A
		Reply must use the sequence number of the Function that it is
		associated with.  A zero sequence number can be used for
		Events (the seqno of the last received Command or Function can
		also be used).

string		Argument in double quotes.  Text is in UTF-8 encoding.  This
		means ASCII is passed as-is.  Special characters are
		represented with a backslash:
			\"	double quote
			\n	newline
			\r	carriage-return
			\t	tab (optional, also works literally)
			\\	backslash
		NUL bytes are not allowed!

boolean		Argument with two possible values:
			T	true
			F	false

number		Argument with a decimal number.

color		Argument with either a decimal number, "none" (without the
		quotes) or the name of a color (without the quotes) defined
		both in the color list in |highlight-ctermfg| and in the color
		list in |gui-colors|.
		New in version 2.5.

offset		A number argument that indicates a byte position in a buffer.
		The first byte has offset zero.  Line breaks are counted for
		how they appear in the file (CR/LF counts for two bytes).
		Note that a multi-byte character is counted for the number of
		bytes it takes.

lnum/col	Argument with a line number and column number position.  The
		line number starts with one, the column is the byte position,
		starting with zero.  Note that a multi-byte character counts
		for several columns.

pathname	String argument: file name with full path.


6.3 Commands						*nb-commands*

actionMenuItem	Not implemented.

actionSensitivity
		Not implemented.

addAnno serNum typeNum off len
		Place an annotation in this buffer.
		Arguments:
		   serNum	number	serial number of this placed
					annotation, used to be able to remove
					it
		   typeNum	number	sequence number of the annotation
					defined with defineAnnoType for this
					buffer
		   off		number	offset where annotation is to be placed
		   len		number	not used
		In version 2.1 "lnum/col" can be used instead of "off".

balloonResult text
		Not implemented.

close		Close the buffer.  This leaves us without current buffer, very
		dangerous to use!

create		Creates a buffer without a name.  Replaces the current buffer
		(it's hidden when it was changed).
		The Vim Controller should use this as the first command for a
		file that is being opened.  The sequence of commands could be:
			create
			setCaretListener	(ignored)
			setModified		(no effect)
			setContentType		(ignored)
			startDocumentListen
			setTitle
			setFullName

defineAnnoType typeNum typeName tooltip glyphFile fg bg
		Define a type of annotation for this buffer.
		Arguments:
		   typeNum	number	sequence number (not really used)
		   typeName	string	name that identifies this annotation
		   tooltip	string	not used
		   glyphFile	string	name of icon file
		   fg		color	foreground color for line highlighting
		   bg		color	background color for line highlighting
		Vim will define a sign for the annotation.
		When color is a number, this is the "#rrggbb" Red, Green and
		Blue values of the color (see |gui-colors|) and the
		highlighting is only defined for GVim.
		When color is a name, this color is defined both for Vim
		running in a color terminal and for GVim.
		When both "fg" and "bg" are "none" no line highlighting is
		used (new in version 2.1).
		When "glyphFile" is empty, no text sign is used (new in
		version 2.1).
		When "glyphFile" is one or two characters long, a text sign is
		defined (new in version 2.1).
		Note: the annotations will be defined in sequence, and the
		sequence number is later used with addAnno.

editFile pathname
		Set the name for the buffer and edit the file "pathname", a
		string argument.
		Normal way for the IDE to tell the editor to edit a file.

		You must set a bufId different of 0 with this command to
		assign a bufId to the buffer. It will trigger an event
		fileOpened with a bufId of 0 but the buffer has been assigned.

		If the IDE is going to pass the file text to the editor use
		these commands instead:
			setFullName
			insert
			initDone
		New in version 2.1.

enableBalloonEval
		Not implemented.

endAtomic	End an atomic operation.  The changes between "startAtomic"
		and "endAtomic" can be undone as one operation.  But it's not
		implemented yet.  Redraw when necessary.

guard off len
		Mark an area in the buffer as guarded.  This means it cannot
		be edited.  "off" and "len" are numbers and specify the text
		to be guarded.

initDone	Mark the buffer as ready for use.  Implicitly makes the buffer
		the current buffer.  Fires the BufReadPost autocommand event.

insertDone
		Sent by Vim Controller to tell Vim an initial file insert is
		done.  This triggers a read message being printed.  Prior to
		version 2.3, no read messages were displayed after opening a
		file.  New in version 2.3.

moveAnnoToFront serNum
		Not implemented.

netbeansBuffer isNetbeansBuffer
		If "isNetbeansBuffer" is "T" then this buffer is "owned" by
		NetBeans.
		New in version 2.2.

putBufferNumber pathname
		Associate a buffer number with the Vim buffer by the name
		"pathname", a string argument.  To be used when the editor
		reported editing another file to the IDE and the IDE needs to
		tell the editor what buffer number it will use for this file.
		Also marks the buffer as initialized.
		New in version 2.1.

raise		Bring the editor to the foreground.
		Only when Vim is run with a GUI.
		New in version 2.1.

removeAnno serNum
		Remove a previously placed annotation for this buffer.
		"serNum" is the same number used in addAnno.

save		Save the buffer when it was modified.  The other side of the
		interface is expected to write the buffer and invoke
		"setModified" to reset the "changed" flag of the buffer.
		The writing is skipped when one of these conditions is true:
		- 'write' is not set
		- the buffer is read-only
		- the buffer does not have a file name
		- 'buftype' disallows writing
		New in version 2.2.

saveDone
		Sent by Vim Controller to tell Vim a save is done.  This
		triggers a save message being printed.  Prior to version 2.3,
		no save messages were displayed after a save.
		New in version 2.3.

setAsUser	Not implemented.

setBufferNumber pathname
		Associate a buffer number with Vim buffer by the name
		"pathname".  To be used when the editor reported editing
		another file to the IDE and the IDE needs to tell the editor
		what buffer number it will use for this file.
		Has the side effect of making the buffer the current buffer.
		See "putBufferNumber" for a more useful command.

setContentType
		Not implemented.

setDot off	Make the buffer the current buffer and set the cursor at the
		specified position.  If the buffer is open in another window
		than make that window the current window.
		If there are folds they are opened to make the cursor line
		visible.
		In version 2.1 "lnum/col" can be used instead of "off".

setExitDelay seconds
		Set the delay for exiting to "seconds", a number.
		This delay is used to give the IDE a chance to handle things
		before really exiting.  The default delay is two seconds.
		New in version 2.1.
		Obsolete in version 2.3.

setFullName pathname
		Set the file name to be used for a buffer to "pathname", a
		string argument.
		Used when the IDE wants to edit a file under control of the
		IDE.  This makes the buffer the current buffer, but does not
		read the file.  "insert" commands will be used next to set the
		contents.

setLocAndSize	Not implemented.

setMark		Not implemented.

setModified modified
		When the boolean argument "modified" is "T" mark the buffer as
		modified, when it is "F" mark it as unmodified.

setModtime time
		Update a buffers modification time after the file has been
		saved directly by the Vim Controller.
		New in version 2.3.

setReadOnly
		Set a file as readonly
		Implemented in version 2.3.

setStyle	Not implemented.

setTitle name
		Set the title for the buffer to "name", a string argument.
		The title is only used for the Vim Controller functions, not
		by Vim.

setVisible visible
		When the boolean argument "visible" is "T", goto the buffer.
		The "F" argument does nothing.

showBalloon text
		Show a balloon (popup window) at the mouse pointer position,
		containing "text", a string argument.  The balloon should
		disappear when the mouse is moved more than a few pixels.
		Only when Vim is run with a GUI.
		New in version 2.1.

specialKeys
		Map a set of keys (mostly function keys) to be passed back
		to the Vim Controller for processing.  This lets regular IDE
		hotkeys be used from Vim.
		Implemented in version 2.3.

startAtomic	Begin an atomic operation.  The screen will not be updated
		until "endAtomic" is given.

startCaretListen
		Not implemented.

startDocumentListen
		Mark the buffer to report changes to the IDE with the
		"insert" and "remove" events.  The default is to report
		changes.

stopCaretListen
		Not implemented.

stopDocumentListen
		Mark the buffer to stop reporting changes to the IDE.
		Opposite of startDocumentListen.
		NOTE: if "netbeansBuffer" was used to mark this buffer as a
		NetBeans buffer, then the buffer is deleted in Vim.  This is
		for compatibility with Sun Studio 10.

unguard off len
		Opposite of "guard", remove guarding for a text area.
		Also sets the current buffer, if necessary.

version		Not implemented.


6.4 Functions and Replies				*nb-functions*

getDot		Not implemented.

getCursor	Return the current buffer and cursor position.
		The reply is:
			seqno bufID lnum col off
		seqno = sequence number of the function
		bufID = buffer ID of the current buffer (if this is unknown -1
			is used)
		lnum  = line number of the cursor (first line is one)
		col   = column number of the cursor (in bytes, zero based)
		off   = offset of the cursor in the buffer (in bytes)
		New in version 2.1.

getLength	Return the length of the buffer in bytes.
		Reply example for a buffer with 5000 bytes:
			123 5000
		TODO: explain use of partial line.

getMark		Not implemented.

getAnno serNum
		Return the line number of the annotation in the buffer.
		Argument:
			serNum		serial number of this placed annotation
		The reply is:
			123 lnum	line number of the annotation
			123 0		invalid annotation serial number
		New in version 2.4.

getModified	When a buffer is specified: Return zero if the buffer does not
		have changes, one if it does have changes.
		When no buffer is specified (buffer number zero): Return the
		number of buffers with changes.  When the result is zero it's
		safe to tell Vim to exit.
		New in version 2.1.

getText		Return the contents of the buffer as a string.
		Reply example for a buffer with two lines
			123 "first line\nsecond line\n"
		NOTE: docs indicate an offset and length argument, but this is
		not implemented.

insert off text
		Insert "text" before position "off".  "text" is a string
		argument, "off" a number.
		"text" should have a "\n" (newline) at the end of each line.
		Or "\r\n" when 'fileformat' is "dos".  When using "insert" in
		an empty buffer Vim will set 'fileformat' accordingly.
		When "off" points to the start of a line the text is inserted
		above this line.  Thus when "off" is zero lines are inserted
		before the first line.
		When "off" points after the start of a line, possibly on the
		NUL at the end of a line, the first line of text is appended
		to this line.  Further lines come below it.
		Possible replies:
			123		no problem
			123 !message	failed
		Note that the message in the reply is not quoted.
		Also sets the current buffer, if necessary.
		Does not move the cursor to the changed text.
		Resets undo information.

remove off length
		Delete "length" bytes of text at position "off".  Both
		arguments are numbers.
		Possible replies:
			123		no problem
			123 !message	failed
		Note that the message in the reply is not quoted.
		Also sets the current buffer, if necessary.

saveAndExit	Perform the equivalent of closing Vim: ":confirm qall".
		If there are no changed files or the user does not cancel the
		operation Vim exits and no result is sent back.  The IDE can
		consider closing the connection as a successful result.
		If the user cancels the operation the number of modified
		buffers that remains is returned and Vim does not exit.
		New in version 2.1.


6.5 Events						*nb-events*

balloonEval off len type
		The mouse pointer rests on text for a short while.  When "len"
		is zero, there is no selection and the pointer is at position
		"off".  When "len" is non-zero the text from position "off" to
		"off" + "len" is selected.
		Only sent after "enableBalloonEval" was used for this buffer.
		"type" is not yet defined.
		Not implemented yet.

balloonText text
		Used when 'ballooneval' is set and the mouse pointer rests on
		some text for a moment.  "text" is a string, the text under
		the mouse pointer.
		Only when Vim is run with a GUI.
		New in version 2.1.

buttonRelease button lnum col
		Report which button was pressed and the location of the cursor
		at the time of the release.  Only for buffers that are owned
		by the Vim Controller.  This event is not sent if the button

		separator line.  If col is less than 1 the button release was
		in the sign area.
		New in version 2.2.

disconnect
		Tell the Vim Controller that Vim is exiting and not to try and
		read or write more commands.
		New in version 2.3.

fileClosed	Not implemented.

keyCommand keyName
		Reports a special key being pressed with name "keyName", which
		is a string.
		Supported key names:
			F1		function key 1
			F2		function key 2
			...

			~		tilde

			X		any unrecognized key

		The key may be prepended by "C", "S" and/or "M" for Control,
		Shift and Meta (Alt) modifiers.  If there is a modifier a dash
		is used to separate it from the key name.  For example:
		"C-F2".
		ASCII characters are new in version 2.1.

keyAtPos keyName lnum/col
		Like "keyCommand" and also report the line number and column
		of the cursor.
		New in version 2.1.

killed		A file was deleted or wiped out by the user and the buffer
		annotations have been removed.  The bufID number for this
		buffer has become invalid.  Only for files that have been
		assigned a bufID number by the IDE.

newDotAndMark off off
		Reports the position of the cursor being at "off" bytes into
		the buffer.  Only sent just before a "keyCommand" event.

quit		Not implemented.

		reports "2.4" (including the quotes).


6.6 Special messages					*nb-special*

These messages do not follow the style of the messages above.  They are
terminated by a newline character.

ACCEPT		Not used.

AUTH password	editor -> IDE: First message that the editor sends to the IDE.
		Must contain the password for the socket server, as specified
		with the |-nb| argument.  No quotes are used!

DISCONNECT	IDE -> editor: break the connection.  The editor will exit.
		The IDE must only send this message when there are no unsaved
		changes!

DETACH		IDE -> editor: break the connection without exiting the
		editor.  Used when the IDE exits without bringing down the
		editor as well.

6.7 Protocol errors					*nb-protocol_errors*

These errors occur when a message violates the protocol:
*E627* *E628* *E629* *E632* *E633* *E634* *E635* *E636*
*E637* *E638* *E639* *E640* *E641* *E642* *E643* *E644* *E645* *E646*
*E647* *E648* *E649* *E650* *E651* *E652*


==============================================================================
7. NetBeans commands					*netbeans-commands*

							*:nbstart* *E511* *E838*
:nbs[tart] {connection}	Start a new Netbeans session with {connection} as the
			socket connection parameters.  The format of
			{connection} is described in |netbeans-parameters|.
			At any time, one may check if the netbeans socket is
			connected by running the command:
			':echo has("netbeans_enabled")'

							*:nbclose*
:nbc[lose]		Close the current NetBeans session. Remove all placed
			signs.

							*:nbkey*
:nb[key] {key}		Pass the {key} to the Vim Controller for processing.
			When a hot-key has been installed with the specialKeys
			command, this command can be used to generate a hotkey
			message to the Vim Controller.
			This command can also be used to pass any text to the
			Vim  Controller. It is used by Pyclewn, for example,
			to build the complete set of gdb commands as Vim user
			commands.
			The events newDotAndMark, keyCommand and keyAtPos are
			generated (in this order).


==============================================================================
8. Known problems					*netbeans-problems*

NUL bytes are not possible.  For editor -> IDE they will appear as NL
characters.  For IDE -> editor they cannot be inserted.

A NetBeans session may be initiated with Vim running in a terminal, and
continued later in a GUI environment after running the |:gui| command. In this
case, the highlighting defined for the NetBeans annotations may be cleared
when the ":gui" command sources .gvimrc and this file loads a colorscheme
that runs the command ":highlight clear".
New in version 2.5.


==============================================================================
9. Debugging NetBeans protocol				*netbeans-debugging*

To debug the Vim protocol, you must first compile Vim with debugging support
and NetBeans debugging support.  See |netbeans-configure| for instructions
about Vim compiling and how to enable debug support.

When running Vim, set the following environment variables:

    export SPRO_GVIM_DEBUG=netbeans.log
    export SPRO_GVIM_DLEVEL=0xffffffff

Vim will then log all the incoming and outgoing messages of the NetBeans
protocol to the file netbeans.log .

The content of netbeans.log after a session looks like this:
Tue May 20 17:19:27 2008
EVT: 0:startupDone=0
CMD 1: (1) create
CMD 2: (1) setTitle "testfile1.txt"
CMD 3: (1) setFullName "testfile1.txt"
EVT(suppressed): 1:remove=3 0 -1
EVT: 1:fileOpened=0 "d:\\work\\vimWrapper\\vimWrapper2\\pyvimwrapper\\tests\\testfile1.txt" T F
CMD 4: (1) initDone
FUN 5: (0) getCursor
REP 5: 1 1 0 0
CMD 6: (2) create
CMD 7: (2) setTitle "testfile2.txt"
CMD 8: (2) setFullName "testfile2.txt"
EVT(suppressed): 2:remove=8 0 -1
EVT: 2:fileOpened=0 "d:\\work\\vimWrapper\\vimWrapper2\\pyvimwrapper\\tests\\testfile2.txt" T F
CMD 9: (2) initDone


==============================================================================
10. NetBeans External Editor

NOTE: This information is obsolete!  Only relevant if you are using an old
version of NetBeans.


10.1. Downloading NetBeans			*netbeans-download*

The NetBeans IDE is available for download from netbeans.org.  You can download
a released version, download sources, or use CVS to download the current
source tree.  If you choose to download sources, follow directions from
netbeans.org on building NetBeans.

Depending on the version of NetBeans you download, you may need to do further
work to get the required External Editor module.  This is the module which lets
NetBeans work with gvim (or xemacs :-).  See http://externaleditor.netbeans.org
for details on downloading this module if your NetBeans release does not have
it.

For C, C++, and Fortran support you will also need the cpp module.  See
http://cpp.netbeans.org for information regarding this module.

You can also download Sun ONE Studio from Sun Microsystems, Inc for a 30 day
free trial.  See http://www.sun.com for further details.


10.2. NetBeans Key Bindings			*netbeans-keybindings*

Vim understands a number of key bindings that execute NetBeans commands.
These are typically all the Function key combinations.  To execute a NetBeans
command, the user must press the Pause key followed by a NetBeans key binding.
For example, in order to compile a Java file, the NetBeans key binding is
"F9".  So, while in vim, press "Pause F9" to compile a java file.  To toggle a
breakpoint at the current line, press "Pause Shift F8".

The Pause key is Function key 21.  If you don't have a working Pause key and
want to use F8 instead, use: >

	:map <F8> <F21>

The External Editor module dynamically reads the NetBeans key bindings so vim
should always have the latest key bindings, even when NetBeans changes them.


10.3. Preparing NetBeans for Vim		*netbeans-preparation*

In order for NetBeans to work with vim, the NetBeans External Editor module
must be loaded and enabled.  If you have a Sun ONE Studio Enterprise Edition
then this module should be loaded and enabled.  If you have a NetBeans release
you may need to find another way of obtaining this open source module.

You can check if you have this module by opening the Tools->Options dialog
and drilling down to the "Modules" list (IDE Configuration->System->Modules).
If your Modules list has an entry for "External Editor" you must make sure
it is enabled (the "Enabled" property should have the value "True").  If your
Modules list has no External Editor see the next section on |obtaining-exted|.


10.4. Obtaining the External Editor Module	*obtaining-exted*

There are 2 ways of obtaining the External Editor module.  The easiest way
is to use the NetBeans Update Center to download and install the module.
Unfortunately, some versions do not have this module in their update
center.  If you cannot download via the update center you will need to
download sources and build the module.  I will try and get the module
available from the NetBeans Update Center so building will be unnecessary.
Also check http://externaleditor.netbeans.org for other availability options.

To download the External Editor sources via CVS and build your own module,
see http://externaleditor.netbeans.org and http://www.netbeans.org.
Unfortunately, this is not a trivial procedure.


10.5. Setting up NetBeans to run with Vim	*netbeans-setup*

Assuming you have loaded and enabled the NetBeans External Editor module
as described in |netbeans-preparation| all you need to do is verify that
the gvim command line is properly configured for your environment.

Open the Tools->Options dialog and open the Editing category.  Select the
External Editor.  The right hand pane should contain a Properties tab and
an Expert tab.  In the Properties tab make sure the "Editor Type" is set
to "Vim".  In the Expert tab make sure the "Vim Command" is correct.

You should be careful if you change the "Vim Command".  There are command
line options there which must be there for the connection to be properly
set up.  You can change the command name but that's about it.  If your gvim
can be found by your $PATH then the VIM Command can start with "gvim".  If
you don't want gvim searched from your $PATH then hard code in the full
Unix path name.  At this point you should get a gvim for any source file
you open in NetBeans.

If some files come up in gvim and others (with different file suffixes) come
up in the default NetBeans editor you should verify the MIME type in the
Expert tab MIME Type property.  NetBeans is MIME oriented and the External

Last change: 2016 Feb 27


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL	  by Ralf Schandl

					*zOS* *z/OS* *OS390* *os390* *MVS*
This file contains the particulars for the z/OS UNIX version of Vim.

1. ASCII/EBCDIC dependent scripts	|zOS-has-ebcdic|
2. Putty and Colors                     |zOS-PuTTY|
3. Motif Problems			|zOS-Motif|
4. Bugs					|zOS-Bugs|
5. Limitations     			|zOS-limitations|
6. Open source on z/OS UNIX		|zOS-open-source|

Contributors: ~
The port to z/OS UNIX was done by Ralf Schandl for the Redbook mentioned
below.

Changes, bug-reports, or both by:

	David Moore
	Anthony Giorgio
	and others

==============================================================================
1. ASCII/EBCDIC dependent scripts	*OS390-has-ebcdic* *zOS-has-ebcdic*

For the internal script language the feature "ebcdic" was added.  With this
you can fix ASCII dependent scripts like this:
>
    if has("ebcdic")
	let space = 64
    else
	let space = 32
    endif
<

==============================================================================
2. PuTTY and Colors			*OS390-PuTTY* *zOS-PuTTY*

If you see problems with syntax highlighting or screen corruptions when you
connect to z/OS using Putty, try the following:

- Configure Putty as "vt220" terminal (Connection->Data)
- Add the following 3 lines to your vimrc:

>
    set t_AB=[4%p1%dm
    set t_AF=[3%p1%dm
    set t_CO=8
<

Note:  is one character use <C-V><Esc> to enter it.

==============================================================================
3. Motif Problems			*OS390-Motif* *zOS-Motif*

Note: Seen with Vim 6.*, never tested since.

It seems that in porting the Motif library to z/OS, a translation from EBCDIC
to ASCII for the accelerator characters of the pull-down menus was forgotten.
Even after I tried to hand convert the menus, the accelerator keys continued
to only work for the opening of menus (like <Alt-F> to open the file menu).
They still do not work for the menu items themselves (like <Alt-F>O to open
the file browser).

There is no solution for this yet.

==============================================================================
4. Bugs					*OS390-bugs* *zOS-Bugs*

- Vim will consistently hang when a large amount of text is selected in
  visual block mode.  This may be due to a memory corruption issue.  Note that
  this occurs in both the terminal and gui versions.

==============================================================================
5. Limitations     			*OS390-limitations* *zOS-limitations*

- No binary search in tag files.
  The program /bin/sort sorts by ASCII value by default.  This program is
  normally used by ctags to sort the tags.  There might be a version of
  ctags out there, that does it right, but we can't be sure.  So this seems to
  be a permanent restriction.

- The cscope interface (|cscope|) doesn't work for the version of cscope
  that we use on our mainframe.  We have a copy of version 15.0b12, and it
  causes Vim to hang when using the "cscope add" command.  I'm guessing that
  the binary format of the cscope database isn't quite what Vim is expecting.
  I've tried to port the current version of cscope (15.3) to z/OS, without
  much success.  If anyone is interested in trying, drop me a line if you
  make any progress.

- No glib/gtk support.  I have not been able to successfully compile glib on
  z/OS UNIX.  This means you'll have to live without the pretty gtk toolbar.
 
Disabled at compile time:
    - Multibyte support         (|multibyte|)
    - Right-to-left mode        (|rileft|)
    - Farsi key map             (|Farsi|)
    - Arabic language support   (|Arabic|)
    - Spell checking            (|spell|)

Never tested:
    - Perl interface		(|perl|)
    - Hangul input		(|hangul|)
    - Encryption support	(|encryption|)
    - Langmap			(|'langmap'|)
    - Python support		(|Python|)
    - Right-to-left mode	(|'rightleft'|)
    - TCL interface		(|tcl|)
    ...

==============================================================================
6. Open source on z/OS UNIX		*OS390-open-source* *zOS-open-source*

Last change: 2010 Aug 14


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


							*Amiga*
This file contains the particularities for the Amiga version of Vim.
There is also a section specifically for |MorphOS| below.

NOTE: The Amiga code is still included, but has not been maintained or tested.

Installation on the Amiga:
- Assign "VIM:" to the directory where the Vim "doc" directory is.  Vim will
  look for the file "VIM:doc/help.txt" (for the help command).
  Setting the environment variable $VIM also works.  And the other way around:
  when $VIM used and it is not defined, "VIM:" is used.
- With DOS 1.3 or earlier: Put "arp.library" in "libs:".  Vim must have been
  compiled with the |+ARP| feature enabled.  Make sure that newcli and run are
  in "C:" (for executing external commands).
- Put a shell that accepts a command with "-c" (e.g. "Csh" from Fish disk
  624) in "c:" or in any other directory that is in your search path (for
  executing external commands).

If you have sufficient memory you can avoid startup delays by making Vim and
csh resident with the command "rez csh vim".  You will have to put
"rezlib.library" in your "libs:" directory.  Under 2.0 you will need rez
version 0.5.

If you do not use digraphs, you can save some memory by recompiling without
the |+digraphs| feature.  If you want to use Vim with other terminals you can
recompile with the TERMCAP option.  Vim compiles with Manx 5.x and SAS 6.x.
See the makefiles and feature.h.

If you notice Vim crashes on some files when syntax highlighting is on, or
when using a search pattern with nested wildcards, it might be that the stack
is too small.  Try increasing the stack size.  In a shell use the Stack
command before launching Vim.  On the Workbench, select the Vim icon, use the
workbench "Info" menu and change the Stack field in the form.

If you want to use different colors set the termcap codes:
	t_mr (for inverted text)
	t_md (for bold text)
	t_me (for normal text after t_mr and t_md)
	t_so (for standout mode)
	t_se (for normal text after t_so)
	t_us (for underlined text)
	t_ue (for normal text after t_us)
	t_ZH (for italic text)
	t_ZR (for normal text after t_ZH)

Standard ANSI escape sequences are used.  The codes are:
30 grey char   40 grey cell   >0 grey background    0 all attributes off
31 black char  41 black cell  >1 black background   1 boldface
32 white char  42 white cell  >2 white background   2 faint
33 blue char   43 blue cell   >3 blue background    3 italic
34 grey char   44 grey cell   >4 grey background    4 underscore
35 black char  45 black cell  >5 black background   7 reverse video
36 white char  46 white cell  >6 white background   8 invisible
37 blue char   47 blue cell   >7 blue background

The codes with '>' must be the last.  The cell and background color should be
the same.  The codes can be combined by separating them with a semicolon.  For
example to get white text on a blue background: >
  :set t_me=^V<Esc>[0;32;43;>3m
  :set t_se=^V<Esc>[0;32;43;>3m
  :set t_ue=^V<Esc>[0;32;43;>3m
  :set t_ZR=^V<Esc>[0;32;43;>3m
  :set t_md=^V<Esc>[1;32;43;>3m
  :set t_mr=^V<Esc>[7;32;43;>3m
  :set t_so=^V<Esc>[0;31;43;>3m
  :set t_us=^V<Esc>[4;32;43;>3m
  :set t_ZH=^V<Esc>[3;32;43;>3m

When using multiple commands with a filter command, e.g. >
  :r! echo this; echo that
Only the output of the last command is used.  To fix this you have to group the
commands.  This depends on the shell you use (that is why it is not done
automatically in Vim).  Examples: >
  :r! (echo this; echo that)
  :r! {echo this; echo that}

Commands that accept a single file name allow for embedded spaces in the file
name.  However, when using commands that accept several file names, embedded
spaces need to be escaped with a backslash.

Vim for MorphOS							*MorphOS*

[this section mostly by Ali Akcaagac]

For the latest info about the MorphOS version:
	http://www.akcaagac.com/index_vim.html


Problems ~

There are a couple of problems which are not MorphOS related but more Vim and
UN*X related.  When starting up Vim in ram: it complains with a nag requester
from MorphOS please simply ignore it.  Another problem is when running Vim as
is some plugins will cause a few problems which you can ignore as well.
Hopefully someone will be fixing it over the time.

To pass all these problems for now you can either run:

	vim <file to be edited>

or if you want to run Vim plain and enjoy the motion of Helpfiles etc. it then
would be better to enter:

	vim --noplugins <of course you can add a file>


Installation ~

1) Please copy the binary 'VIM' file to c:
2) Get the Vim runtime package from:

	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/amiga/vim62rt.tgz

   and unpack it in your 'Apps' directory of the MorphOS installation.  For me
   this would create following directory hierarchy:

	MorphOS:Apps/Vim/Vim62/...

3) Add the following lines to your s:shell-startup (Important!).

	;Begin VIM
	Set VIM=MorphOS:Apps/Vim/Vim62
	Assign HOME: ""
	;End VIM

4) Copy the '.vimrc' file to s:

5) There is also a file named 'color-sequence' included in this archive.  This
   will set the MorphOS Shell to show ANSI colors.  Please copy the file to s:
   and change the s:shell-startup to:

	;Begin VIM
	Set VIM=MorphOS:Apps/Vim/Vim62
	Assign HOME: ""
	Execute S:Color-Sequence
	Cls
	;End VIM

This file contains the particularities for the BeBox/BeOS version of Vim.  For
matters not discussed in this file, Vim behaves very much like the Unix
|os_unix.txt| version.

 1. General			|beos-general|
 2. Compiling Vim		|beos-compiling|
 3. Timeout in the Terminal	|beos-timeout|
 4. Unicode vs. Latin1		|beos-unicode|
 5. The BeOS GUI		|beos-gui|
 6. The $VIM directory		|beos-vimdir|
 7. Drag & Drop			|beos-dragndrop|
 8. Single Launch vs. Multiple

11. Mouse key mappings		|beos-mouse|
12. Color names			|beos-colors|
13. Compiling with Perl		|beos-perl|


1. General						*beos-general*

The default syntax highlighting mostly works with different foreground colors
to highlight items.  This works best if you set your Terminal window to a
darkish background and light letters.  Some middle-grey background (for
instance (r,g,b)=(168,168,168)) with black letters also works nicely.  If you
use the default light background and dark letters, it may look better to
simply reverse the notion of foreground and background color settings.  To do
this, add this to your .vimrc file (where <Esc> may need to be replaced with
the escape character): >

  :if &term == "beos-ansi"
  :    set t_AB=<Esc>[3%dm
  :    set t_AF=<Esc>[4%dm
  :endif


2. Compiling Vim					*beos-compiling*

From the Advanced Access Preview Release (AAPR) on, Vim can be configured with
the standard configure script.  To get the compiler and its flags right, use
the following command-line in the shell (you can cut and paste it in one go):

CC=$BE_C_COMPILER CFLAGS="$BE_DEFAULT_C_FLAGS -O7" \
    ./configure --prefix=/boot/home/config

$BE_C_COMPILER is usually "mwcc", $BE_DEFAULT_C_FLAGS is usually "-I- -I."

When configure has run, and you wish to enable GUI support, you must edit the
config.mk file so that the lines with GUI_xxx refer to $(BEOSGUI_xxx) instead
of $(NONE_xxx).
Alternatively you can make this change in the Makefile; it will have a
more permanent effect.  Search for "NONE_".

After compilation you need to add the resources to the binary.  Add the
following few lines near the end (before the line with "exit $exit_value") of
the link.sh script to do this automatically.

    rmattr BEOS:TYPE vim
    copyres os_beos.rsrc vim
    mimeset vim

Also, create a dummy file "strip":

    #!/bin/sh
    mimeset $1
    exit 0

You will need it when using "make install" to install Vim.

Now type "make" to compile Vim, then "make install" to install it.

If you want to install Vim by hand, you must copy Vim to $HOME/config/bin, and
create a bunch of symlinks to it ({g,r,rg}{vim,ex,view}).  Furthermore you must
copy Vim's configuration files to $HOME/config/share/vim:
vim-5.0s/{*.vim,doc,syntax}.  For completeness, you should also copy the nroff
manual pages to $HOME/config/man/man1.  Don't forget ctags/ctags and xxd/xxd!

Obviously, you need the unlimited linker to actually link Vim.  See
http://www.metrowerks.com for purchasing the CodeWarrior compiler for BeOS.
There are currently no other linkers that can do the job.

This won't be able to include the Perl or Python interfaces even if
you have the appropriate files installed. |beos-perl|


3. Timeout in the Terminal				*beos-timeout*

Because some POSIX/UNIX features are still missing[1], there is no direct OS
support for read-with-timeout in the Terminal.  This would mean that you cannot
use :mappings of more than one character, unless you also :set notimeout.
|'timeout'|

To circumvent this problem, I added a workaround to provide the necessary
input with timeout by using an extra thread which reads ahead one character.
As a side effect, it also makes Vim recognize when the Terminal window
resizes.

Function keys are not supported in the Terminal since they produce very
indistinctive character sequences.

These problems do not exist in the GUI.

[1]: there is no select() on file descriptors; also the termios VMIN and VTIME
settings do not seem to work properly.  This has been the case since DR7 at
least and still has not been fixed as of PR2.

							*beos-unicode*
4. Unicode vs. Latin1					*beos-utf8*

BeOS uses Unicode and UTF-8 for text strings (16-bit characters encoded to
8-bit characters).  Vim assumes ISO-Latin1 or other 8-bit character codes.
This does not produce the desired results for non-ASCII characters.  Try the
command :digraphs to see.  If they look messed up, use :set isprint=@ to
(slightly) improve the display of ISO-Latin1 characters 128-255.  This works
better in the GUI, depending on which font you use (below).

You may also use the /boot/bin/xtou command to convert UTF-8 files from (xtou
-f iso1 filename) or to (xtou -t iso1 filename) ISO-Latin1 characters.


5. The BeOS GUI						*beos-gui*

The BeOS GUI is no longer included.  It was not maintained for a while and
most likely didn't work.  If you want to work on this: get the Vim 6.x version
and merge it back in.


6. The $VIM directory					*beos-vimdir*

$VIM is the symbolic name for the place where Vims support files are stored.
The default value for $VIM is set at compile time and can be determined with >

  :version

The normal value is /boot/home/config/share/vim.  If you don't like it you can
set the VIM environment variable to override this, or set 'helpfile' in your
.vimrc: >

  :if version >= 500
  :    set helpfile=~/vim/vim54/doc/help.txt
  :    syntax on
  :endif


7. Drag & Drop						*beos-dragndrop*

You can drop files and directories on either the Vim icon (starts a new Vim
session, unless you use the File Types application to set Vim to be "Single
Launch") or on the Vim window (starts editing the files).  Dropping a folder
sets Vim's current working directory. |:cd| |:pwd| If you drop files or
folders with either SHIFT key pressed, Vim changes directory to the folder
that contains the first item dropped.  When starting Vim, there is no need to
press shift: Vim behaves as if you do.

Files dropped set the current argument list. |argument-list|


8. Single Launch vs. Multiple Launch			*beos-launch*

As distributed Vim's Application Flags (as seen in the FileTypes preference)
are set to Multiple Launch.  If you prefer, you can set them to Single Launch
instead.  Attempts to start a second copy of Vim will cause the first Vim to
open the files instead.  This works from the Tracker but also from the command
line.  In the latter case, non-file (option) arguments are not supported.

NB: Only the GUI version has a BApplication (and hence Application Flags).
This section does not apply to the GUI-less version, should you compile one.


9. Fonts						*beos-fonts*

Set fonts with >

  :set guifont=Courier10_BT/Roman/10

where the first part is the font family, the second part the style, and the
third part the size.  You can use underscores instead of spaces in family and
style.

Best results are obtained with monospaced fonts (such as Courier).  Vim
attempts to use all fonts in B_FIXED_SPACING mode but apparently this does not
work for proportional fonts (despite what the BeBook says).

Vim also tries to use the B_ISO8859_1 encoding, also known as ISO Latin 1.
This also does not work for all fonts.  It does work for Courier, but not for
ProFontISOLatin1/Regular (strangely enough).  You can verify this by giving the >

  :digraphs

command, which lists a bunch of characters with their ISO Latin 1 encoding.
If, for instance, there are "box" characters among them, or the last character
isn't a dotted-y, then for this font the encoding does not work.

If the font you specify is unavailable, you get the system fixed font.

Standard fixed-width system fonts are:

	      ProFontISOLatin1/Regular
		  Courier10_BT/Roman
		  Courier10_BT/Italic
		  Courier10_BT/Bold
		  Courier10_BT/Bold_Italic

Standard proportional system fonts are:

		    Swis721_BT/Roman
		    Swis721_BT/Italic
		    Swis721_BT/Bold
		    Swis721_BT/Bold_Italic
		Dutch801_Rm_BT/Roman
		Dutch801_Rm_BT/Italic
		Dutch801_Rm_BT/Bold
		Dutch801_Rm_BT/Bold_Italic
		   Baskerville/Roman
		   Baskerville/Italic
		   Baskerville/Bold
		   Baskerville/Bold_Italic
		 SymbolProp_BT/Regular

Try some of them, just for fun.


10. The meta key modifier				*beos-meta*

The META key modifier is obtained by the left or right OPTION keys.  This is
because the ALT (aka COMMAND) keys are not passed to applications.


11. Mouse key mappings					*beos-mouse*

Vim calls the various mouse buttons LeftMouse, MiddleMouse and RightMouse.  If
you use the default Mouse preference settings these names indeed correspond to
reality.  Vim uses this mapping:

    Button 1 -> LeftMouse,
    Button 2 -> RightMouse,
    Button 3 -> MiddleMouse.

If your mouse has fewer than 3 buttons you can provide your own mapping from
mouse clicks with modifier(s) to other mouse buttons.  See the swapmouse
package for an example:					 |gui-mouse-mapping|
$VIMRUNTIME/pack/dist/opt/swapmouse/plugin/swapmouse.vim


12. Color names						*beos-colors*

Vim has a number of color names built-in.  Additional names are read from the
file $VIMRUNTIME/rgb.txt, if present.  This file is basically the color
database from X.  Names used from this file are cached for efficiency.


13. Compiling with Perl					*beos-perl*

Compiling with Perl support enabled is slightly tricky.  The Metrowerks
compiler has some strange ideas where to search for include files.  Since
several include files with Perl have the same names as some Vim header
files, the wrong ones get included.  To fix this, run the following Perl
script while in the vim-5.0/src directory: >

   preproc.pl > perl.h

    #!/bin/env perl
    # Simple #include expander, just good enough for the Perl header files.

    use strict;
    use IO::File;
    use Config;

    sub doinclude
    {
	my $filename = $_[0];
	my $fh = new IO::File($filename, "r");
	if (defined $fh) {
	    print "/* Start of $filename */\n";

	    while (<$fh>) {
		if (/^#include "(.*)"/) {
		    doinclude($1);
		    print "/* Back in $filename */\n";
		} else {
		    print $_;
		}
	    }
	    print "/* End of $filename */\n";

	    undef $fh;
	} else {
	    print "/* Cannot open $filename */\n";
	    print "#include \"$filename\"\n";
	}
    }

    chdir     $Config{installarchlib}."/CORE";
    doinclude "perl.h";

It expands the "perl.h" header file, using only other Perl header files.

Now you can configure & make Vim with the --enable-perlinterp option.
Be warned though that this adds about 616 kilobytes to the size of Vim!
Without Perl, Vim with default features and GUI is about 575K, with Perl
it is about 1191K.

Last change: 2006 Mar 30


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


							*dos* *DOS*
This file documents the common particularities of the MS-DOS and Win32
versions of Vim.  Also see |os_win32.txt| and |os_msdos.txt|.

1. File locations		|dos-locations|
2. Using backslashes		|dos-backslash|
3. Standard mappings		|dos-standard-mappings|
4. Screen output and colors	|dos-colors|
5. File formats			|dos-file-formats|
6. :cd command			|dos-:cd|
7. Interrupting			|dos-CTRL-Break|
8. Temp files			|dos-temp-files|
9. Shell option default		|dos-shell|

==============================================================================
1. File locations					*dos-locations*

If you keep the Vim executable in the directory that contains the help and
syntax subdirectories, there is no need to do anything special for Vim to
work.  No registry entries or environment variables need to be set.  Just make
sure that the directory is in your search path, or use a shortcut on the
desktop.

Your vimrc files ("_vimrc" and "_gvimrc") are normally located one directory
up from the runtime files.  If you want to put them somewhere else, set the
environment variable $VIM to the directory where you keep them.  Example: >
	set VIM=C:\user\piet
Will find "c:\user\piet\_vimrc".
Note: This would only be needed when the computer is used by several people.
Otherwise it's simpler to keep your _vimrc file in the default place.

If you move the executable to another location, you also need to set the $VIM
environment variable.  The runtime files will be found in "$VIM/vim{version}".
Example: >
	set VIM=E:\vim
Will find the version 5.4 runtime files in "e:\vim\vim54".
Note: This is _not_ recommended.  The preferred way is to keep the executable
in the runtime directory.

If you move your executable AND want to put your "_vimrc" and "_gvimrc" files
somewhere else, you must set $VIM to where you vimrc files are, and set
$VIMRUNTIME to the runtime files.  Example: >
	set VIM=C:\usr\piet
	set VIMRUNTIME=E:\vim\vim54
Will find "c:\user\piet\_vimrc" and the runtime files in "e:\vim\vim54".

See |$VIM| and |$VIMRUNTIME| for more information.

Under Windows 95, you can set $VIM in your C:\autoexec.bat file.  For
example: >
  set VIM=D:\vim
Under Windows NT, you can set environment variables for each user separately
under "Start/Settings/Control Panel->System", or through the properties in the
menu of "My Computer", under the Environment Tab.

==============================================================================
2. Using backslashes					*dos-backslash*

Using backslashes in file names can be a problem.  Vi halves the number of
backslashes for some commands.  Vim is a bit more tolerant and does not remove
backslashes from a file name, so ":e c:\foo\bar" works as expected.  But when
a backslash occurs before a special character (space, comma, backslash, etc.),
Vim removes the backslash.  Use slashes to avoid problems: ":e c:/foo/bar"
works fine.  Vim replaces the slashes with backslashes internally to avoid
problems with some MS-DOS programs and Win32 programs.

When you prefer to use forward slashes, set the 'shellslash' option.  Vim will
then replace backslashes with forward slashes when expanding file names.  This
is especially useful when using a Unix-like 'shell'.

==============================================================================
3. Standard mappings				*dos-standard-mappings*

The mappings for CTRL-PageUp and CTRL-PageDown have been removed, they now
jump to the next or previous tab page |<C-PageUp>| |<C-PageDown>|

If you want them to move to the first and last screen line you can use these
mappings:

key		key code     Normal/Visual mode	    Insert mode ~
CTRL-PageUp	<M-N><M-C-D>	    H		    <C-O>H
CTRL-PageDown	<M-N>v		    L$		    <C-O>L<C-O>$

Additionally, these keys are available for copy/cut/paste.  In the Win32
and DJGPP versions, they also use the clipboard.

Shift-Insert	paste text (from clipboard)			*<S-Insert>*
CTRL-Insert	copy Visual text (to clipboard)			*<C-Insert>*
CTRL-Del	cut Visual text (to clipboard)			*<C-Del>*
Shift-Del	cut Visual text (to clipboard)			*<S-Del>*
CTRL-X		cut Visual text (to clipboard)

These mappings accomplish this (Win32 and DJGPP versions of Vim):

key		key code     Normal	Visual	    Insert ~
Shift-Insert	<M-N><M-T>   "*P	"-d"*P      <C-R><C-O>*
CTRL-Insert	<M-N><M-U>		"*y
Shift-Del	<M-N><M-W>		"*d
CTRL-Del	<M-N><M-X>		"*d
CTRL-X		<C-X>			"*d

Or these mappings (non-Win32 version of Vim):

key		key code     Normal	Visual	    Insert ~
Shift-Insert	<M-N><M-T>   P		"-dP	    <C-R><C-O>"
CTRL-Insert	<M-N><M-U>		y
Shift-Del	<M-N><M-W>		d
CTRL-Del	<M-N><M-X>		d

When the clipboard is supported, the "* register is used.

==============================================================================
4. Screen output and colors				*dos-colors*

The default output method for the screen is to use bios calls.  This works
right away on most systems.  You do not need ansi.sys.  You can use ":mode" to
set the current screen mode.  See |:mode|.

To change the screen colors that Vim uses, you can use the |:highlight|
command.  The Normal highlight group specifies the colors Vim uses for normal
text.  For example, to get grey text on a blue background: >
	:hi Normal ctermbg=Blue ctermfg=grey
See |highlight-groups| for other groups that are available.

A DOS console does not support attributes like bold and underlining.  You can
set the color used in five modes with nine terminal options.  Note that this
is not necessary since you can set the color directly with the ":highlight"
command; these options are for backward compatibility with older Vim versions.
The |'highlight'| option specifies which of the five modes is used for which
action. >

	:set t_mr=^V^[\|xxm		start of invert mode
	:set t_md=^V^[\|xxm		start of bold mode
	:set t_me=^V^[\|xxm		back to normal text

	:set t_so=^V^[\|xxm		start of standout mode
	:set t_se=^V^[\|xxm		back to normal text

	:set t_us=^V^[\|xxm		start of underline mode
	:set t_ue=^V^[\|xxm		back to normal text

	:set t_ZH=^V^[\|xxm		start of italics mode
	:set t_ZR=^V^[\|xxm		back to normal text

^V is CTRL-V
^[ is <Esc>
You must replace xx with a decimal code, which is the foreground color number
and background color number added together:

COLOR			FOREGROUND	BACKGROUND	~
Black			    0		    0
DarkBlue		    1		   16
DarkGreen		    2		   32
DarkCyan		    3		   48
DarkRed			    4		   64
DarkMagenta		    5		   80
Brown, DarkYellow	    6		   96
LightGray		    7		  112
DarkGray		    8		  128 *
Blue, LightBlue		    9		  144 *
Green, LightGreen	   10		  160 *
Cyan, LightCyan		   11		  176 *
Red, LightRed		   12		  192 *
Magenta, LightMagenta	   13		  208 *
Yellow, LightYellow	   14		  224 *
White			   15		  240 *

* Depending on the display mode, the color codes above 128 may not be
  available, and code 128 will make the text blink.

When you use 0, the color is reset to the one used when you started Vim
(usually 7, lightgray on black, but you can override this.  If you have
overridden the default colors in a command prompt, you may need to adjust
some of the highlight colors in your vimrc---see below).
This is the default for t_me.

The defaults for the various highlight modes are:
	t_mr	112	 reverse mode: Black text (0) on LightGray (112)
	t_md	 15	 bold mode: White text (15) on Black (0)
	t_me	  0	 normal mode (revert to default)

	t_so	 31	 standout mode: White (15) text on DarkBlue (16)
	t_se	  0	 standout mode end (revert to default)

	t_czh	225	 italic mode: DarkBlue text (1) on Yellow (224)
	t_czr	  0	 italic mode end (revert to default)

	t_us	 67	 underline mode: DarkCyan text (3) on DarkRed (64)
	t_ue	  0	 underline mode end (revert to default)

These colors were chosen because they also look good when using an inverted
display, but you can change them to your liking.

Example: >
  :set t_mr=^V^[\|97m	" start of invert mode: DarkBlue (1) on Brown (96)
  :set t_md=^V^[\|67m	" start of bold mode: DarkCyan (3) on DarkRed (64)
  :set t_me=^V^[\|112m	" back to normal mode: Black (0) on LightGray (112)

  :set t_so=^V^[\|37m	" start of standout mode: DarkMagenta (5) on DarkGreen
									(32)
  :set t_se=^V^[\|112m	" back to normal mode: Black (0) on LightGray (112)

==============================================================================
5. File formats						*dos-file-formats*

If the 'fileformat' option is set to "dos" (which is the default), Vim accepts
a single <NL> or a <CR><NL> pair for end-of-line (<EOL>).  When writing a
file, Vim uses <CR><NL>.  Thus, if you edit a file and write it, Vim replaces
<NL> with <CR><NL>.

If the 'fileformat' option is set to "unix", Vim uses a single <NL> for <EOL>
and shows <CR> as ^M.

You can use Vim to replace <NL> with <CR><NL> by reading in any mode and
writing in Dos mode (":se ff=dos").
You can use Vim to replace <CR><NL> with <NL> by reading in Dos mode and
writing in Unix mode (":se ff=unix").

Vim sets 'fileformat' automatically when 'fileformats' is not empty (which is
the default), so you don't really have to worry about what you are doing.
					|'fileformat'| |'fileformats'|

If you want to edit a script file or a binary file, you should set the
'binary' option before loading the file.  Script files and binary files may
contain single <NL> characters which Vim would replace with <CR><NL>.  You can
set 'binary' automatically by starting Vim with the "-b" (binary) option.

==============================================================================
6. :cd command						*dos-:cd*

The ":cd" command recognizes the drive specifier and changes the current
drive.  Use ":cd c:" to make drive C the active drive.  Use ":cd d:\foo" to go
to the directory "foo" in the root of drive D.  Vim also recognizes UNC names
if the system supports them; e.g., ":cd \\server\share\dir".  |:cd|

==============================================================================
7. Interrupting						*dos-CTRL-Break*

Use CTRL-Break instead of CTRL-C to interrupt searches.  Vim does not detect
the CTRL-C until it tries to read a key.

==============================================================================
8. Temp files						*dos-temp-files*

Only for the 16 bit and 32 bit DOS version:
Vim puts temporary files (for filtering) in the first of these directories
that exists and in which Vim can create a file:
	$TMP
	$TEMP
	C:\TMP
	C:\TEMP
	current directory

For the Win32 version (both console and GUI):
Vim uses standard Windows functions to obtain a temporary file name (for
filtering).  The first of these directories that exists and in which Vim can
create a file is used:
	$TMP
	$TEMP
	current directory

==============================================================================
9. Shell option default					*dos-shell*

The default for the 'sh' ('shell') option is "command.com" on Windows 95 and
"cmd.exe" on Windows NT.  If SHELL is defined, Vim uses SHELL instead, and if
SHELL is not defined but COMSPEC is, Vim uses COMSPEC.  Vim starts external
commands with "<shell> /c <command_name>".  Typing CTRL-Z starts a new command
subshell.  Return to Vim with "exit".	|'shell'| |CTRL-Z|

If you are running a third-party shell, you may need to set the
|'shellcmdflag'| ('shcf') and |'shellquote'| ('shq') or |'shellxquote'|
('sxq') options.  Unfortunately, this also depends on the version of Vim used.
For example, with the MKS Korn shell or with bash, the values of the options
should be:

		DOS 16 bit	    DOS 32 bit		Win32  ~
'shellcmdflag'	   -c			-c		 -c
'shellquote'	   "
'shellxquote'						 "

For Dos 16 bit this starts the shell as:
	<shell> -c "command name" >file
For Win32 as:
	<shell> -c "command name >file"
For DOS 32 bit, DJGPP does this internally somehow.

When starting up, Vim checks for the presence of "sh" anywhere in the 'shell'
option.  If it is present, Vim sets the 'shellcmdflag' and 'shellquote' or
'shellxquote' options will be set as described above.

					*mac* *Mac* *macintosh* *Macintosh*

This file documents the particularities of the Macintosh version of Vim.

NOTE: This file is a bit outdated.  You might find more useful info here:
	http://macvim.org/

1. Filename Convention		|mac-filename|
2. .vimrc an .vim files		|mac-vimfile|
3. FAQ				|mac-faq|
4. Known Lack			|mac-lack|
5. Mac Bug Report		|mac-bug|
6. Compiling Vim		|mac-compile|

There was a Mac port for version 3.0 of Vim.  Here are the first few lines
from the old file:

VIM Release Notes
Initial Macintosh release, VIM version 3.0
19 October 1994

Eric Fischer
<enf1@midway.uchicago.edu>, <eric@jcp.uchicago.edu>, <etaoin@uchicago.edu>
5759 N. Guilford Ave
Indianapolis IN 46220 USA

==============================================================================
1. Filename Convention					*mac-filename*

Starting with Vim version 7 you can just use the unix path separators with
Vim. In order to determine if the specified filename is relative to the
current folder or absolute (i.e. relative to the "Desktop"), the following
algorithm is used:

	If the path start by a "/", the path is absolute
	If the path start by a ":", the path is relative
	If the path doesn't start by neither a "/" nor ":",
	  and a ":" is found before a "/" then the path is absolute
>
		:e /HD/text
		:e HD:text
<	Edit the file "text" of the disk "HD" >
		:e :src:main.c
		:e src/main.c
<	Edit the file "main.c" in the folder "src" in the current folder >
		:e os_mac.c
<	Edit the file "os_mac.c" in the current folder.

You can use the |$VIM| and |$VIMRUNTIME|  variable. >

		:so $VIMRUNTIME:syntax:syntax.vim

==============================================================================
2. .vimrc and .vim files				*mac-vimfile*

It is recommended to use Unix style line separators for Vim scripts, thus a
single newline character.

When starting up Vim will load the $VIMRUNTIME/macmap.vim script to define
default command-key mappings.

On older systems files starting with a dot "." are discouraged, thus the rc
files are named "vimrc" or "_vimrc" and "gvimrc" or "_gvimrc".  These files
can be in any format (mac, dos or unix).  Vim can handle any file format when
the |'nocompatible'| option is set, otherwise it will only handle mac format
files.

==============================================================================
3. Mac FAQ						*mac-faq*

On the internet:  http://macvim.org/OSX/index.php#FAQ

Q: I can't enter non-ASCII character in Apple Terminal.
A: Under Window Settings, Emulation, make sure that "Escape non-ASCII
   characters" is not checked.

Q: How do I start the GUI from the command line?
A: Assuming that Vim.app is located in /Applications:
	open /Applications/Vim.app
   Or:
	/Applications/Vim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim -g  {arguments}

Q: How can I set $PATH to something reasonable when I start Vim.app from the
   GUI or with open?
A: The following trick works with most shells.  Put it in your vimrc file.
   This is included in the system vimrc file included with the binaries
   distributed at macvim.org . >
	let s:path = system("echo echo VIMPATH'${PATH}' | $SHELL -l")
	let $PATH = matchstr(s:path, 'VIMPATH\zs.\{-}\ze\n')

==============================================================================
4. Mac Lack						*mac-lack*

In a terminal CTRL-^ needs to be entered as Shift-Control-6.  CTRL-@ as
Shift-Control-2.

==============================================================================
5. Mac Bug Report					*mac-bug*

When reporting any Mac specific bug or feature change, please use the vim-mac
maillist |vim-mac|.  However, you need to be subscribed.  An alternative is to
send a message to the current MacVim maintainers:

	mac@vim.org

==============================================================================
6. Compiling Vim					*mac-compile*

See the file "src/INSTALLmac.txt" that comes with the source files.

							*MiNT* *Atari*
This file contains the particularities for the Atari MiNT version of Vim.

For compiling Vim on the Atari running MiNT see "INSTALL" and "Makefile"
in the src directory.

Vim for MiNT behaves almost exactly like the Unix version.
The Unix behavior described in the documentation also refers to the
MiNT version of Vim unless explicitly stated otherwise.

For wildcard expansion of <~> (home directory) you need a shell that
expands the tilde.  The vanilla Bourne shell doesn't recognize it.
With csh and ksh it should work OK.

The MiNT version of vim needs the termcap file /etc/termcap with the
terminal capabilities of your terminal.  Builtin termcaps are
supported for the vt52 terminal.  Termcap entries for the TOSWIN window
manager and the virtual console terminals have been appended to the
termcap file that comes with the Vim distribution.

If you should encounter problems with swapped <BS> and <Del> keys, see
|:fixdel|.

Because terminal updating under MiNT is often slow (e.g. serial line
terminal), the 'showcmd' and 'ruler' options are default off.
If you have a fast terminal, try setting them on.  You might
also want to set 'ttyfast'.

					*msdos* *ms-dos* *MSDOS* *MS-DOS*
This file used to contain the particularities for the MS-DOS version of Vim.
MS-DOS support was removed in patch 7.4.1399.  If you want to use it you will
need to get a version older than that.  Note that the MS-DOS version doesn't
work, there is not enough memory.  The DOS32 version (using DJGPP) might still

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Julian Kinraid


							*QNX* *qnx*

1. General			|qnx-general|
2. Compiling Vim		|qnx-compiling|
3. Terminal support		|qnx-terminal|
4. Photon GUI			|photon-gui|
5. Photon fonts			|photon-fonts|
6. Bugs & things To Do

==============================================================================

1. General						*qnx-general*

Vim on QNX behaves much like other unix versions. |os_unix.txt|


2. Compiling Vim					*qnx-compiling*

Vim can be compiled using the standard configure/make approach.  If you want to
compile for X11, pass the --with-x option to configure.  Otherwise, running
./configure without any arguments or passing --enable-gui=photon, will compile
vim with the Photon gui support.  Run ./configure --help , to find out other
features you can enable/disable.


3. Terminal support					*qnx-terminal*

Vim has support for the mouse and clipboard in a pterm, if those options
are compiled in, which they are normally.

The options that affect mouse support are |'mouse'| and |'ttymouse'|.  When
using the mouse, only simple left and right mouse clicking/dragging is
supported.  If you hold down shift, ctrl, or alt while using the mouse, pterm
will handle the mouse itself.  It will make a selection, separate from what
vim's doing.

When the mouse is in use, you can press Alt-RightMouse to open the pterm menu.
To turn the mouse off in vim, set the mouse option to nothing, set mouse=


4. Photon GUI						*photon-gui*

To start the gui for vim, you need to run either gvim or vim -g, otherwise
the terminal version will run.  For more info - |gui-x11-start|

Supported features:
	:browse command					|:browse|
	:confirm command				|:confirm|
	Cursor blinking					|'guicursor'|
	Menus, popup menus and menu priorities		|:menu|
							|popup-menu|
							|menu-priority|
	Toolbar						|gui-toolbar|
							|'toolbar'|
	Font selector (:set guifont=*)			|photon-fonts|
	Mouse focus					|'mousefocus'|
	Mouse hide					|'mousehide'|
	Mouse cursor shapes				|'mouseshape'|
	Clipboard					|gui-clipboard|

Unfinished features:
	Various international support, such as Farsi & Hebrew support,
	different encodings, etc.

	This help file

Unsupported features:
	Find & Replace window				|:promptfind|
	Tearoff menus

	Other things which I can't think of so I can't list them


5. Fonts						*photon-fonts*

You set fonts in the gui with the guifont option >
	:set guifont=Lucida\ Terminal
<
The font must be a monospace font, and any spaces in the font name must be
escaped with a '\'.  The default font used is PC Terminal, size 8.  Using
'*' as the font name will open a standard Photon font selector where you can
select a font.

Following the name, you can include optional settings to control the size and
style of the font, each setting separated by a ':'.  Not all fonts support the
various styles.

The options are,
    s{size}	Set the size of the font to {size}
    b		Bold style
    a		Use antialiasing
    i		Italic style

Examples:

Set the font to monospace size 10 with antialiasing >
	:set guifont=monospace:s10:a
<
Set the font to Courier size 12, with bold and italics >
	:set guifont=Courier:s12:b:i
<
Select a font with the requester >
	:set guifont=*
<


6. Bugs & things To Do

Known problems:
	- Vim hangs sometimes when running an external program.  Workaround:
	  put this line in your |vimrc| file: >
		set noguipty

Bugs:
	- Still a slight problem with menu highlighting.
	- When using phditto/phinows/etc., if you are using a font that
	  doesn't support the bold attribute, when vim attempts to draw
	  bold text it will be all messed up.
	- The cursor can sometimes be hard to see.
	- A number of minor problems that can fixed. :)

Todo:
	- Improve multi-language support.
	- Options for setting the fonts used in the menu and toolbar.
	- Find & Replace dialog.
	- The clientserver features.
	- Maybe tearoff menus.

	- Replace usage of fork() with spawn() when launching external
	  programs.

						*riscos* *RISCOS* *RISC-OS*
The RISC OS support has been removed from Vim with patch 7.3.187.
If you would like to use Vim on RISC OS get the files from before that patch.

Last change: 2005 Mar 29


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


							*unix* *Unix*
This file contains the particularities for the Unix version of Vim.

For compiling Vim on Unix see "INSTALL" and "Makefile" in the src directory.

The default help file name is "/usr/local/lib/vim/help.txt"
The files "$HOME/.vimrc" and "$HOME/.exrc" are used instead of "s:.vimrc" and
"s:.exrc".  Additionally "/usr/local/etc/vimrc" is used first.
If "/usr/local/share" exists it is used instead of "/usr/local/lib".

Temporary files (for filtering) are put in "/tmp".  If you want to place them
somewhere else, set the environment variable $TMPDIR to the directory you
prefer.

With wildcard expansion you can use '~' (home directory) and '$'
(environment variable).

							*fork* *spoon*
For executing external commands fork()/exec() is used when possible, otherwise
system() is used, which is a bit slower.  The output of ":version" includes
|+fork| when fork()/exec() is used, |+system()| when system() is used.  This
can be changed at compile time.
(For forking of the GUI version see |gui-fork|.)

Because terminal updating under Unix is often slow (e.g. serial line
terminal, shell window in suntools), the 'showcmd' and 'ruler' options
are default off.  If you have a fast terminal, try setting them on.  You might
also want to set 'ttyfast'.

When using Vim in an xterm the mouse clicks can be used by Vim by setting
'mouse' to "a".  If there is access to an X-server gui style copy/paste will
be used and visual feedback will be provided while dragging with the mouse.
If you then still want the xterm copy/paste with the mouse, press the shift
key when using the mouse.  See |mouse-using|.  Visual feedback while dragging
can also be achieved via the 'ttymouse' option if your xterm is new enough.

							*terminal-colors*
To use colors in Vim you can use the following example (if your terminal
supports colors, but "T_Co" is empty or zero): >
   :set t_me=^[[0;1;36m     " normal mode (undoes t_mr and t_md)
   :set t_mr=^[[0;1;33;44m  " reverse (invert) mode
   :set t_md=^[[1;33;41m    " bold mode
   :set t_se=^[[1;36;40m    " standout end
   :set t_so=^[[1;32;45m    " standout mode
   :set t_ue=^[[0;1;36m     " underline end
   :set t_us=^[[1;32m       " underline mode start
[the ^[ is an <Esc>, type CTRL-V <Esc> to enter it]

For real color terminals the ":highlight" command can be used.

The file "tools/vim132" is a shell script that can be used to put Vim in 132
column mode on a vt100 and lookalikes.

		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL


							*VMS* *vms*
This file contains the particularities for the VMS version of Vim.
You can reach this information file by typing :help VMS in Vim command
prompt.

10. Authors		|vms-authors|

==============================================================================

1. Getting started					*vms-started*

Vim (Vi IMproved) is a Vi-compatible text editor that runs on nearly every
operating system known to humanity.  Now use Vim on OpenVMS too, in character
or X/Motif environment.  It is fully featured and absolutely compatible with
Vim on other operating systems.

==============================================================================

2. Download files					*vms-download*

You can download the Vim source code by ftp from the official Vim site:
	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/
Or use one of the mirrors:
	ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/MIRRORS

You can download precompiled executables from:
	http://www.polarhome.com/vim/
	ftp://ftp.polarhome.com/pub/vim/

To use the precompiled binary version, you need one of these archives:

  vim-XX-exe-ia64-gui.zip       IA64 GUI/Motif executables
  vim-XX-exe-ia64-gtk.zip       IA64 GUI/GTK executables
  vim-XX-exe-ia64-term.zip      IA64 console executables
  vim-XX-exe-axp-gui.zip	Alpha GUI/Motif executables
  vim-XX-exe-axp-gtk.zip	Alpha GUI/GTK executables
  vim-XX-exe-axp-term.zip       Alpha console executables
  vim-XX-exe-vax-gui.zip	VAX GUI executables
  vim-XX-exe-vax-term.zip       VAX console executables

and of course (optional)
  vim-XX-runtime.zip		runtime files

The binary archives contain: vim.exe, ctags.exe, xxd.exe files.

For GTK executables you will need GTKLIB that is available for
Alpha and IA64 platform.

==============================================================================

3. Compiling						*vms-compiling*

See the file [.SRC]INSTALLVMS.TXT.

==============================================================================

4. Problems						*vms-problems*

The code has been tested under Open VMS 6.2 - 8.2 on Alpha, VAX and IA64
platforms with the DEC C compiler.  It should work without big problems.
If your system does not have some include libraries you can tune up in
OS_VMS_CONF.H file.

If you decided to build Vim with +perl, +python, etc. options, first you need
to download OpenVMS distributions of Perl and Python.  Build and deploy the
libraries and change adequate lines in MAKE_VMS.MMS file.  There should not be
a problem from Vim side.

Also GTK, XPM library paths should be configured in MAKE_VMS.MMS

Note: Under VAX it should work with the DEC C compiler without problems.  The
VAX C compiler is not fully ANSI C compatible in pre-processor directives
semantics, therefore you have to use a converter program that will do the lion
part of the job.  For detailed instructions read file INSTALLvms.txt

MMS_VIM.EXE is build together with VIM.EXE, but for XXD.EXE you should
change to a subdirectory and build it separately.

CTAGS is not part of the Vim source distribution anymore, however the OpenVMS
specific source might contain CTAGS source files as described above.
You can find more information about CTAGS on VMS at
http://www.polarhome.com/ctags/

Advanced users may try some acrobatics in FEATURE.H file as well.

It is possible to compile with +xfontset +xim options too, but then you have
to set up GUI fonts etc. correctly.  See :help xim from Vim command prompt.

You may want to use GUI with GTK icons, then you have to download and install
GTK for OpenVMS or at least runtime shareable images - LIBGTK from
polarhome.com

For more advanced questions, please send your problem to Vim on VMS mailing
list <vim-vms@polarhome.com>

==============================================================================

5. Deploy						*vms-deploy*

Vim uses a special directory structure to hold the document and runtime files:

   vim (or wherever)
    |- tmp
    |- vim57
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
    |- vim62
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
    |- vim64
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
    vimrc    (system rc files)
    gvimrc

Use: >

	define/nolog VIM	device:[path.vim]
	define/nolog VIMRUNTIME device:[path.vim.vim60]
	define/nolog TMP	device:[path.tmp]

To get vim.exe to find its document, filetype, and syntax files, and to
specify a directory where temporary files will be located.  Copy the "runtime"
subdirectory of the Vim distribution to vimruntime.

Logicals $VIMRUNTIME and $TMP are optional.

If $VIMRUNTIME is not set, Vim will guess and try to set up automatically.
Read more about it at :help runtime

If $TMP is not set, you will not be able to use some functions as CTAGS,
XXD, printing etc. that use temporary directory for normal operation.
The $TMP directory should be readable and writable by the user(s).
The easiest way to set up $TMP is to define a logical: >

	define/nolog TMP SYS$SCRATCH
or as: >
	define/nolog TMP SYS$LOGIN

==============================================================================

6. Practical usage					*vms-usage*

Usually, you want to run just one version of Vim on your system, therefore
it is enough to dedicate one directory for Vim.
Copy the whole Vim runtime directory structure to the deployment position.
Add the following lines to your LOGIN.COM (in SYS$LOGIN directory).
Set up the logical $VIM as: >

	$ define VIM device:<path>

Set up some symbols: >

	$ ! vi starts Vim in chr. mode.
	$ vi*m  :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE

	$ !gvi starts Vim in GUI mode.
	$ gv*im :== spawn/nowait mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g

Please, check the notes for customization and configuration of symbols.

You may want to create .vimrc and .gvimrc files in your home directory
(SYS$LOGIN) to overwrite default settings.

The easiest way is just rename example files.  You may leave the menu file
(MENU.VIM) and files vimrc and gvimrc in the original $VIM directory.  It will
be the default setup for all users, and for users it is enough to just have
their own additions or resetting in their home directory in files .vimrc and
.gvimrc.  It should work without problems.

Note: Remember, system rc files (default for all users) don't have a leading
".".  So, system rc files are: >

	$VIM:vimrc
	$VIM:gvimrc
	$VIM:menu.vim

and user customized rc files are: >

	sys$login:.vimrc
	sys$login:.gvimrc

You can check that everything is at the right place with the :version command.

Example LOGIN.COM: >

	$ define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VIM]
	$ vi*m :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE
	$ gv*im:== spawn/nowait/input=NLA0 mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g -GEOMETRY 80x40
	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.223/trans=tcpip

Note: This set-up should be enough, if you are working on a standalone server or
clustered environment, but if you want to use Vim as an internode editor in
DECNET environment, it will satisfy as well.
You just have to define the "whole" path: >

	$ define VIM "<server_name>[""user password""]::device:<path>"
	$ vi*m :== "mcr VIM:VIM.EXE"

For example: >

	$ define VIM "PLUTO::RF10:[UTIL.VIM]"
	$ define VIM "PLUTO""ZAY mypass""::RF10:[UTIL.VIM]" ! if passwd required

You can also use the $VIMRUNTIME logical to point to the proper version of Vim
if you have installed more versions at the same time.  If $VIMRUNTIME is not
defined Vim will borrow its value from the $VIM logical.  You can find more
information about the $VIMRUNTIME logical by typing :help runtime as a Vim
command.

System administrators might want to set up a system wide Vim installation,
then add to the SYS$STARTUP:SYLOGICALS.COM >

	$ define/nolog/sys VIM device:<path>
	$ define/nolog/sys TMP SYS$SCRATCH

And to the SYS$STARTUP:SYLOGIN.COM >

	$ vi*m :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE
	$ gv*im:== spawn/nowait/input=NLA0 mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g -GEOMETRY 80x40


It will set up a normal Vim work environment for every user on the system.

IMPORTANT: Vim on OpenVMS (and on other case insensitive system) command line
parameters are assumed to be lowercase. In order to indicate that a command
line parameter is uppercase "/" sign must be used.

Examples:
  >
	vim -R  filename  ! means: -r List swap files and exit
	vim -/r filename  ! means: -R Readonly mode (like "view")
	vim -u	<vimrc>   ! means: -u Use <vimrc> instead of any .vimrc
	vim -/u <gvimrc>  ! means: -U Use <gvimrc> instead of any .gvimrc

==============================================================================

7. GUI mode questions					*vms-gui*

OpenVMS is a real mainframe OS, therefore even if it has a GUI console, most
of the users do not use a native X/Window environment during normal operation.
It is not possible to start Vim in GUI mode "just like that".  But anyhow it
is not too complicated either.

First of all: you will need an executable that is built with the GUI enabled.

Second: you need to have installed DECW/Motif on your VMS server, otherwise
you will get errors that some shareable libraries are missing.

Third: If you choose to run Vim with extra features such as GUI/GTK then you
need a GTK installation too or at least a GTK runtime environment (LIBGTK
can be downloaded from http://www.polarhome.com/vim/).

1) If you are working on the VMS X/Motif console:
   Start Vim with the command: >

	$ mc device:<path>VIM.EXE -g
<
   or type :gui as a command to the Vim command prompt.  For more info :help
   gui

2) If you are working on some other X/Window environment like Unix or a remote
   X VMS console.  Set up display to your host with: >

	$ set disp/create/node=<your IP address>/trans=<transport-name>
<
   and start Vim as in point 1.  You can find more help in VMS documentation or
   type: help set disp in VMS prompt.
   Examples: >

	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.159		 ! default trans is DECnet
	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.159/trans=tcpip ! TCP/IP network
	$ set disp/create/node=192.168.5.159/trans=local ! display on the same node

Note: you should define just one of these.
For more information type $help set disp in VMS prompt.

3) Another elegant solution is XDM if you have installed on OpenVMS box.
   It is possible to work from XDM client as from GUI console.

4) If you are working on MS-Windows or some other non X/Window environment
   you need to set up one X server and run Vim as in point 2.
   For MS-Windows there are available free X servers as MIX, Omni X etc.,
   as well as excellent commercial products as eXcursion or ReflectionX with
   built-in DEC support.

Please note, that executables without GUI are slightly faster during startup
than with enabled GUI in character mode. Therefore, if you do not use GUI
features, it is worth to choose non GUI executables.

8.1 Backspace/delete

There are backspace/delete key inconsistencies with VMS.
:fixdel doesn't do the trick, but the solution is: >

	:inoremap ^? ^H		" for terminal mode
	:inoremap <Del> ^H	" for gui mode

Read more in ch: 8.6 (Terminal problems).
(Bruce Hunsaker <BNHunsaker@chq.byu.edu> Vim 5.3)


8.2 Filters

Vim supports filters, i.e., if you have a sort program that can handle
input/output redirection like Unix (<infile >outfile), you could use >

	:map \s 0!'aqsort<CR>

(Charles E. Campbell, Jr. <cec@gryphon.gsfc.nasa.gov> Vim 5.4)


8.3 VMS file version numbers

Vim is saving files into a new file with the next higher file version
number, try these settings. >

	:set nobackup	     " does not create *.*_ backup files
	:set nowritebackup   " does not have any purpose on VMS.  It's the
			     " default.

Recovery is working perfectly as well from the default swap file.
Read more with :help swapfile

(Claude Marinier <ClaudeMarinier@xwavesolutions.com> Vim 5.5, Zoltan Arpadffy
Vim 5.6)


8.4 Directory conversion

Vim will internally convert any unix-style paths and even mixed unix/VMS
paths into VMS style paths.  Some typical conversions resemble:

	/abc/def/ghi		-> abc:[def]ghi.
	/abc/def/ghi.j		-> abc:[def]ghi.j
	/abc/def/ghi.j;2	-> abc:[def]ghi.j;2
	/abc/def/ghi/jkl/mno	-> abc:[def.ghi.jkl]mno.
	abc:[def.ghi]jkl/mno	-> abc:[def.ghi.jkl]mno.
	  ./			-> current directory
	  ../			-> relative parent directory
	  [.def.ghi]		-> relative child directory
	   ./def/ghi		-> relative child directory

Note: You may use <,> brackets as well (device:<path>file.ext;version) as
rf10:<user.zay.work>test.c;1

(David Elins <delins@foliage.com>, Jerome Lauret
<JLAURET@mail.chem.sunysb.edu> Vim 5.6)


8.5 Remote host invocation

It is possible to use Vim as an internode editor.
1. Edit some file from remote node: >

	vi "<server>""username passwd""::<device>:<path><filename>;<version>"

Example: >
	vi "pluto""zay passwd""::RF10:<USER.ZAY.WORK>TEST.C;1"

Note: syntax is very important, otherwise VMS will recognize more parameters
instead of one (resulting with: file not found)

2.  Set up Vim as your internode editor.  If Vim is not installed on your
host, just set up your IP address, the full Vim path including the server name
and run the command procedure below: >

	$ if (p1 .eqs. "") .OR. (p2 .eqs. "") then goto usage
	$ set disp/create/node=<your_IP_here>/trans=tcpip
	$ define "VIM "<vim_server>""''p1' ''p2'""::<device>:<vim_path>"
	$  vi*m :== "mcr VIM:VIM.EXE"
	$ gv*im :== "spawn/nowait mcr VIM:VIM.EXE -g"
	$ goto end
	$ usage:
	$ write sys$output " Please enter username and password as a parameter."
	$ write sys$output " Example: @SETVIM.COM username passwd"
	$ end:

Note: Never use it in a clustered environment (you do not need it), loading
could be very-very slow, but even faster than a local Emacs. :-)

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 5.6)


8.6 Terminal problems

If your terminal name is not known to Vim and it is trying to find the default
one you will get the following message during start-up:
---
Terminal entry not found in termcap
'unknown-terminal' not known.  Available built-in terminals are:
    builtin_gui
    builtin_riscos
    builtin_amiga
    builtin_beos-ansi
    builtin_ansi
    builtin_vt320
    builtin_vt52
    builtin_pcansi
    builtin_win32
    builtin_xterm
    builtin_iris-ansi
    builtin_debug
    builtin_dumb
defaulting to 'vt320'
---
The solution is to define the default terminal name: >

	$ ! unknown terminal name.  Let us use vt320 or ansi instead.
	$ ! Note: it's case sensitive
	$ define term "vt320"

Terminals from VT100 to VT320 (as V300, VT220, VT200) do not need any extra
keyboard mappings.  They should work perfectly as they are, including arrows,
Ins, Del buttons etc., except Backspace in GUI mode.  To solve it, add to
.gvimrc: >

	inoremap <Del> <BS>

Vim will also recognize that they are fast terminals.

If you have some annoying line jumping on the screen between windows add to
your .vimrc file: >

	set ttyfast	" set fast terminal

Note: if you're using Vim on remote host or through a very slow connection, it's
recommended to avoid the fast terminal option with: >

	set nottyfast   " set terminal to slow mode

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 5.6)


8.7 Hex-editing and other external tools

A very important difference between OpenVMS and other systems is that VMS uses
special commands to execute executables: >

	RUN <path>filename
	MCR <path>filename <parameters>

OpenVMS users always have to be aware that the Vim command :! "just" drop them
to DCL prompt.  This feature is possible to use without any problem with all
DCL commands, but if we want to execute some programs such as XXD, CTAGS, JTAGS,
etc.  we're running into trouble if we follow the Vim documentation (see: help
xxd).

Solution: Execute with the MC command and add the full path to the executable.
Example: Instead of :%!xxd command use: >

	:%!mc vim:xxd

... or in general: >
	:!mc <path>filename <parameters>

Note: You can use XXD and CTAGS from GUI menu.

To customize ctags it is possible to define the logical $CTAGS with standard
parameters as: >

	define/nolog CTAGS "--totals -o sys$login:tags"

For additional information, please read :help tagsearch and CTAGS
documentation at http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ctags.html.

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 5.6-70)


8.8 Sourcing vimrc and gvimrc

If you want to use your .vimrc and .gvimrc from other platforms (e.g. Windows)
you can get in trouble if you ftp that file(s): VMS has different end-of-line
indication.
The symptom is that Vim is not sourcing your .vimrc/.gvimrc, even if you say:
>
	:so sys$login:.vimrc

One trick is to compress (e.g. zip) the files on the other platform and
uncompress it on VMS; if you have the same symptom, try to create the files
with copy-paste (for this you need both op. systems reachable from one
machine, e.g. an Xterm on Windows or telnet to Windows from VMS).

(Sandor Kopanyi, <sandor.kopanyi@mailbox.hu> Vim 6.0a)


8.9 Printing from Vim

To be able to print from Vim (running in GUI mode) under VMS you have to set
up $TMP logical which should point to some temporary directory and logical
SYS$PRINT to your default print queue.
Example: >

	$define SYS$PRINT HP5ANSI

You can print out the whole buffer or just the marked area.
More info under :help hardcopy

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 6.0c)


8.10 Setting up the symbols

When I use GVIM this way and press CTRL-Y in the parent terminal, gvim exits.
I now use a different symbol that seems to work OK and fixes the problem.
I suggest this instead: >

	$ GV*IM:==SPAWN/NOWAIT/INPUT=NLA0: MCR VIM:VIM.EXE -G -GEOMETRY 80X40

The /INPUT=NLA0: separates the standard input of the gvim process from the
parent terminal, to block signals from the parent window.
Without the -GEOMETRY, the GVIM window size will be minimal and the menu
will be confused after a window-resize.

(Carlo Mekenkamp, Coen Engelbarts, Vim 6.0ac)


8.11 diff and other GNU programs

From 6.0 diff functionality has been implemented, but OpenVMS does not use
GNU/Unix like diff therefore built in diff does not work.
There is a simple solution to solve this anomaly.  Install a Unix like diff
and Vim will work perfectly in diff mode too.  You just have to redefine your
diff program as: >

	define /nolog diff <GNU_PATH>diff.exe

Another, more sophisticated solution is described below (8.12 diff-mode)
There are other programs such as patch, make etc that may cause the same
problems.  At www.polarhome.com is possible to download an GNU package for
Alpha and VAX boxes that is meant to solve GNU problems on OpenVMS.
(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 6.1)


8.12 diff-mode

Vim 6.0 and higher supports Vim diff-mode (See |new-diff-mode|, |diff-mode|
and |08.7|).  This uses the external program 'diff' and expects a Unix-like
output format from diff.  The standard VMS diff has a different output
format.  To use Vim on VMS in diff-mode, you need to:
    1 Install a Unix-like diff program, e.g. GNU diff
    2 Tell Vim to use the Unix-like diff for diff-mode.

You can download GNU diff from the VIM-VMS website, it is one of the GNU
tools in http://www.polarhome.com/vim/files/gnu_tools.zip.  I suggest to
unpack it in a separate directory "GNU" and create a logical GNU: that
points to that directory, e.g: >

   DEFINE GNU    <DISK>:[<DIRECTORY>.BIN.GNU]

You may also want to define a symbol GDIFF, to use the GNU diff from the DCL
prompt: >

   GDIFF :==     $GNU:DIFF.EXE

Now you need to tell Vim to use the new diff program.  Take the example
settings from |diff-diffexpr| and change the call to the external diff
program to the new diff on VMS.  Add this to your .vimrc file: >

     " Set up vimdiff options
       if v:version >= 600
	" Use GNU diff on VMS
	set diffexpr=MyDiff()
	function MyDiff()
	   let opt = ""
	   if &diffopt =~ "icase"
	     let opt = opt . "-i "
	   endif
	   if &diffopt =~ "iwhite"
	     let opt = opt . "-b "
	   endif
	   silent execute "!mc GNU:diff.exe -a " . opt . v:fname_in . " " .  v:fname_new .
		\  " > " . v:fname_out
	endfunction
      endif

You can now use Vim in diff-mode, e.g. to compare two files in read-only
mode: >

    $ VIM -D/R <FILE1> <FILE2>

You can also define new symbols for vimdiff, e.g.: >

    $ VIMDIFF     :== 'VIM' -D/R
    $ GVIMDIFF    :== 'GVIM' -D/R

You can now compare files in 4 ways: >

    1. VMS  diff:  $ DIFF     <FILE1> <FILE2>
    2. GNU  diff:  $ GDIFF    <FILE1> <FILE2>
    3. VIM  diff:  $ VIMDIFF  <FILE1> <FILE2>
    4. GVIM diff:  $ GVIMDIFF <FILE1> <FILE2>

(Coen Engelbarts, Vim 6.1)


8.13 Allow '$' in C keywords

DEC C uses many identifiers with '$' in them.  This is not allowed in ANSI C,
and Vim recognises the '$' as the end of the identifier.  You can change this
with the 'iskeyword' option.
Add this command to your .vimrc file: >

    autocmd FileType c,cpp,cs  set iskeyword+=$

You can also create the file(s) $VIM/FTPLUGIN/C.VIM (and/or CPP.VIM and
CS.VIM) and add this command: >

	set iskeyword+=$

Now word-based commands, e.g. the '*'-search-command and the CTRL-]
tag-lookup, work on the whole identifier.  (Ctags on VMS also supports '$' in
C keywords since ctags version 5.1.)

(Coen Engelbarts, Vim 6.1)

8.14 VIMTUTOR for beginners

The VIMTUTOR.COM DCL script can help Vim beginners to learn/make their first
steps with Vim on OpenVMS.  Depending of binary distribution you may start it
with: >

	@vim:vimtutor

(Thomas.R.Wyant III, Vim 6.1)

8.16 Slow start in console mode issue

As GUI/GTK Vim works equally well in console mode, many administrators
deploy those executables system wide.
Unfortunately, on a remote slow connections GUI/GTK executables behave rather
slow when user wants to run Vim just in the console mode - because of X
environment detection timeout.

Luckily, there is a simple solution for that. Administrators need to deploy
both GUI/GTK build and just console build executables, like below: >

    |- vim73
    |----- doc
    |----- syntax
       vimrc    (system rc files)
       gvimrc
       gvim.exe (the renamed GUI or GTK built vim.exe)
       vim.exe  (the console only executable)

Define system symbols like below in for ex in LOGIN.COM or SYLOGIN.COM: >

	$ define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VIM73] ! where you VIM directory is
	$ vi*m  :== mcr VIM:VIM.EXE
	$ gvi*m :== mcr VIM:GVIM.EXE
	$ ! or you can try to spawn with
	$ gv*im :== spawn/nowait/input=NLA0 mcr VIM:GVIM.EXE -g -GEOMETRY 80x40


Like this, users that do not have X environment and want to use Vim just in
console mode can avoid performance problems.

(Zoltan Arpadffy, Vim 7.2)

8.15 Common VIM directory - different architectures

In a cluster that contains nodes with different architectures like below:

$show cluster
View of Cluster from system ID 11655  node: TOR                                                                     18-AUG-2008 11:58:31
+---------------------------------+
        SYSTEMS         MEMBERS 
+-----------------------+---------
  NODE     SOFTWARE     STATUS 
+--------+--------------+---------
 TOR     VMS V7.3-2    MEMBER  
 TITAN2  VMS V8.3      MEMBER  
 ODIN    VMS V7.3-2    MEMBER  
+---------------------------------+

It is convenient to have a common VIM directory but execute different
executables.
There are several solutions for this problem:

Solution 1.  All executables in the same directory with different names
This is easily done with the following script that can be added
to the login.com or sylogin.com: >

	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "VAX"
	$ then
	$       say "VAX platform"
	$       vi*m:== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_VAX
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "ALPH"
	$ then
	$       say "ALPHA platform"
	$       vi*m :== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_AXP
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("ARCH_NAME") .eqs. "IA64"
	$ then
	$      say "IA64 platform"
	$      vi*m :== mcr vim:VIM.EXE_IA64
	$ endif

Solution 2.  Different directories: >

	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "VAX"
	$ then
	$       say "VAX platform"
	$       define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.VAX_EXE] ! VAX executables
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("NODE_HWTYPE") .eqs. "ALPH"
	$ then
	$       say "ALPHA platform"
	$       define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.AXP_EXE] ! AXP executables
	$ endif
	$ if f$getsyi("ARCH_NAME") .eqs. "IA64"
	$ then
	$      say "IA64 platform"
	$      define/nolog VIM RF10:[UTIL.IA64_EXE] ! IA64 executables
	$ endif
        $! VIMRUNTIME must be defined in order to find runtime files
	$ define/nolog VIMRUNTIME RF10:[UTIL.VIM73]

A good example for this approach is the [GNU]gnu_tools.com script from
GNU_TOOLS.ZIP package downloadable from http://www.polarhome.com/vim/

						*win32* *Win32* *MS-Windows*
This file documents the idiosyncrasies of the Win32 version of Vim.

The Win32 version of Vim works on Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10.  There are
both console and GUI versions.

The 32 bit version also runs on 64 bit MS-Windows systems.

1. Known problems		|win32-problems|
2. Startup			|win32-startup|
3. Restore screen contents	|win32-restore|
4. Using the mouse		|win32-mouse|
5. Running under Windows 95	|win32-win95|
6. Running under Windows 3.1	|win32-win3.1|
7. Win32 mini FAQ		|win32-faq|

Additionally, there are a number of common Win32 and DOS items:

Standard mappings		|dos-standard-mappings|
Screen output and colors	|dos-colors|
File formats			|dos-file-formats|
:cd command			|dos-:cd|
Interrupting			|dos-CTRL-Break|
Temp files			|dos-temp-files|
Shell option default		|dos-shell|

Win32 GUI			|gui-w32|

Credits:
The Win32 version was written by George V. Reilly <george@reilly.org>.
The original Windows NT port was done by Roger Knobbe <RogerK@wonderware.com>.
The GUI version was made by George V. Reilly and Robert Webb.

For compiling see "src/INSTALLpc.txt".			*win32-compiling*

==============================================================================
1. Known problems					*win32-problems*

When doing file name completion, Vim also finds matches for the short file
name.  But Vim will still find and use the corresponding long file name.  For
example, if you have the long file name "this_is_a_test" with the short file
name "this_i~1", the command ":e *1" will start editing "this_is_a_test".

==============================================================================
2. Startup						*win32-startup*

Current directory					*win32-curdir*

If Vim is started with a single file name argument, and it has a full path
(starts with "x:\"), Vim assumes it was started from the file explorer and
will set the current directory to where that file is.  To avoid this when
typing a command to start Vim, use a forward slash instead of a backslash.
Example: >

	vim c:\text\files\foo.txt

Will change to the "C:\text\files" directory. >

	vim c:/text\files\foo.txt

Will use the current directory.


Term option						*win32-term*

The only kind of terminal type that the Win32 version of Vim understands is
"win32", which is built-in.  If you set 'term' to anything else, you will
probably get very strange behavior from Vim.  Therefore Vim does not obtain
the default value of 'term' from the environment variable "TERM".

$PATH							*win32-PATH*

The directory of the Vim executable is appended to $PATH.  This is mostly to
make "!xxd" work, as it is in the Tools menu.  And it also means that when
executable() returns 1 the executable can actually be executed.

Quotes in file names					*win32-quotes*

Quotes inside a file name (or any other command line argument) can be escaped
with a backslash.  E.g. >
	vim -c "echo 'foo\"bar'"

Alternatively use three quotes to get one: >
	vim -c "echo 'foo"""bar'"

The quotation rules are:

1. A `"` starts quotation.
2. Another `"` or `""` ends quotation. If the quotation ends with `""`, a `"`
   is produced at the end of the quoted string.

Examples, with [] around an argument:
        "foo"           -> [foo]
        "foo""          -> [foo"]
        "foo"bar        -> [foobar]
        "foo" bar       -> [foo], [bar]
        "foo""bar       -> [foo"bar]
        "foo"" bar      -> [foo"], [bar]
        "foo"""bar"     -> [foo"bar]


==============================================================================
3. Restore screen contents				*win32-restore*

When 'restorescreen' is set (which is the default), Vim will restore the
original contents of the console when exiting or when executing external
commands.  If you don't want this, use ":set nors".	|'restorescreen'|

==============================================================================
4. Using the mouse					*win32-mouse*

The Win32 version of Vim supports using the mouse.  If you have a two-button
mouse, the middle button can be emulated by pressing both left and right
buttons simultaneously - but note that in the Win32 GUI, if you have the right
mouse button pop-up menu enabled (see 'mouse'), you should err on the side of
pressing the left button first.				|mouse-using|

When the mouse doesn't work, try disabling the "Quick Edit Mode" feature of
the console.

==============================================================================
5. Running under Windows 95				*win32-win95*
					*windows95* *windows98* *windowsme*
Windows 95/98/ME support was removed in patch 8.0.0029  If you want to use it
you will need to get a version older than that.

==============================================================================
6. Running under Windows 3.1				*win32-win3.1*

					*win32s* *windows-3.1* *gui-w32s*
There was a special version of Gvim that runs under Windows 3.1 and 3.11.
Support was removed in patch 7.4.1363.

==============================================================================
7. Win32 mini FAQ					*win32-faq*

Q. How do I change the font?
A. In the GUI version, you can use the 'guifont' option.  Example: >
	:set guifont=Lucida_Console:h15:cDEFAULT
<  In the console version, you need to set the font of the console itself.
   You cannot do this from within Vim.

Q. How do I type dead keys on Windows NT?
A. Dead keys work on NT 3.51.  Just type them as you would in any other
   application.
   On NT 4.0, you need to make sure that the default locale (set in the
   Keyboard part of the Control Panel) is the same as the currently active
   locale.  Otherwise the NT code will get confused and crash!  This is a NT
   4.0 problem, not really a Vim problem.

Q. I'm using Vim to edit a symbolically linked file on a Unix NFS file server.
   When I write the file, Vim does not "write through" the symlink.  Instead,
   it deletes the symbolic link and creates a new file in its place.  Why?
A. On Unix, Vim is prepared for links (symbolic or hard).  A backup copy of
   the original file is made and then the original file is overwritten.  This
   assures that all properties of the file remain the same.  On non-Unix
   systems, the original file is renamed and a new file is written.  Only the
   protection bits are set like the original file.  However, this doesn't work
   properly when working on an NFS-mounted file system where links and other
   things exist.  The only way to fix this in the current version is not
   making a backup file, by ":set nobackup nowritebackup"     |'writebackup'|

Q. I'm using Vim to edit a file on a Unix file server through Samba.  When I
   write the file, the owner of the file is changed.  Why?
A. When writing a file Vim renames the original file, this is a backup (in
   case writing the file fails halfway).  Then the file is written as a new
   file.  Samba then gives it the default owner for the file system, which may
   differ from the original owner.
   To avoid this set the 'backupcopy' option to "yes".  Vim will then make a
   copy of the file for the backup, and overwrite the original file.  The
   owner isn't changed then.

Q. How do I get to see the output of ":make" while it's running?
A. Basically what you need is to put a tee program that will copy its input
   (the output from make) to both stdout and to the errorfile.  You can find a
   copy of tee (and a number of other GNU tools) at
   http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net or http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
   Alternatively, try the more recent Cygnus version of the GNU tools at
   http://www.cygwin.com  Other Unix-style tools for Win32 are listed at
   http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Unix/Win32/
   When you do get a copy of tee, you'll need to add >
	:set shellpipe=\|\ tee
<  to your _vimrc.

Q. I'm storing files on a remote machine that works with VisionFS, and files
   disappear!
A. VisionFS can't handle certain dot (.) three letter extension file names.
   SCO declares this behavior required for backwards compatibility with 16bit
   DOS/Windows environments.  The two commands below demonstrate the behavior:
>
	echo Hello > file.bat~ 
	dir > file.bat
<
   The result is that the "dir" command updates the "file.bat~" file, instead
   of creating a new "file.bat" file.  This same behavior is exhibited in Vim
   when editing an existing file named "foo.bat" because the default behavior
   of Vim is to create a temporary file with a '~' character appended to the
   name.  When the file is written, it winds up being deleted.

   Solution: Add this command to your _vimrc file: >
	:set backupext=.temporary

Q. How do I change the blink rate of the cursor?
A. You can't!  This is a limitation of the NT console.  NT 5.0 is reported to
   be able to set the blink rate for all console windows at the same time.

							*:!start*
Q. How can I run an external command or program asynchronously?
A. When using :! to run an external command, you can run it with "start": >
	:!start winfile.exe<CR>
<  Using "start" stops Vim switching to another screen, opening a new console,
   or waiting for the program to complete; it indicates that you are running a
   program that does not affect the files you are editing.  Programs begun
   with :!start do not get passed Vim's open file handles, which means they do
   not have to be closed before Vim.
   To avoid this special treatment, use ":! start".
   There are two optional arguments (see the next Q):
       /min  the window will be minimized
       /b    no console window will be opened
   You can use only one of these flags at a time.  A second one will be
   treated as the start of the command.

Q. How do I avoid getting a window for programs that I run asynchronously?
A. You have two possible solutions depending on what you want:
   1) You may use the /min flag in order to run program in a minimized state
      with no other changes. It will work equally for console and GUI
      applications.
   2) You can use the /b flag to run console applications without creating a
      console window for them (GUI applications are not affected). But you
      should use this flag only if the application you run doesn't require any
      input.  Otherwise it will get an EOF error because its input stream
      (stdin) would be redirected to \\.\NUL (stdout and stderr too).

   Example for a console application, run Exuberant ctags: >
        :!start /min ctags -R .
<  When it has finished you should see file named "tags" in your current
   directory.  You should notice the window title blinking on your taskbar.
   This is more noticeable for commands that take longer.
   Now delete the "tags" file and run this command: >
        :!start /b ctags -R .
<  You should have the same "tags" file, but this time there will be no
   blinking on the taskbar.
   Example for a GUI application: >
        :!start /min notepad
        :!start /b notepad
<  The first command runs notepad minimized and the second one runs it
   normally.

						*windows-icon*
Q. I don't like the Vim icon, can I change it?
A. Yes, place your favorite icon in bitmaps/vim.ico in a directory of
   'runtimepath'.  For example ~/vimfiles/bitmaps/vim.ico.

Last change: 2016 Sep 11


		  VIM REFERENCE MANUAL    by Bram Moolenaar


Patterns and search commands				*pattern-searches*

The very basics can be found in section |03.9| of the user manual.  A few more
explanations are in chapter 27 |usr_27.txt|.

1. Search commands		|search-commands|
2. The definition of a pattern	|search-pattern|
3. Magic			|/magic|
4. Overview of pattern items	|pattern-overview|
5. Multi items			|pattern-multi-items|
6. Ordinary atoms		|pattern-atoms|
7. Ignoring case in a pattern	|/ignorecase|
8. Composing characters		|patterns-composing|
9. Compare with Perl patterns	|perl-patterns|
10. Highlighting matches	|match-highlight|

==============================================================================
1. Search commands				*search-commands*

							*/*
/{pattern}[/]<CR>	Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of
			{pattern} |exclusive|.

/{pattern}/{offset}<CR>	Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of
			{pattern} and go |{offset}| lines up or down.
			|linewise|.

							*/<CR>*
/<CR>			Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			latest used pattern |last-pattern| with latest used
			|{offset}|.

//{offset}<CR>		Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			latest used pattern |last-pattern| with new
			|{offset}|.  If {offset} is empty no offset is used.

							*?*
?{pattern}[?]<CR>	Search backward for the [count]'th previous
			occurrence of {pattern} |exclusive|.

?{pattern}?{offset}<CR>	Search backward for the [count]'th previous
			occurrence of {pattern} and go |{offset}| lines up or
			down |linewise|.

							*?<CR>*
?<CR>			Search backward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			latest used pattern |last-pattern| with latest used
			|{offset}|.

??{offset}<CR>		Search backward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			latest used pattern |last-pattern| with new
			|{offset}|.  If {offset} is empty no offset is used.

							*n*
n			Repeat the latest "/" or "?" [count] times.
			If the cursor doesn't move the search is repeated with
			count + 1.
			|last-pattern| {Vi: no count}

							*N*
N			Repeat the latest "/" or "?" [count] times in
			opposite direction. |last-pattern| {Vi: no count}

							*star* *E348* *E349*
*			Search forward for the [count]'th occurrence of the
			word nearest to the cursor.  The word used for the
			search is the first of:
				1. the keyword under the cursor |'iskeyword'|
				2. the first keyword after the cursor, in the
				   current line
				3. the non-blank word under the cursor
				4. the first non-blank word after the cursor,
				   in the current line
			Only whole keywords are searched for, like with the
			command "/\<keyword\>".  |exclusive|  {not in Vi}
			'ignorecase' is used, 'smartcase' is not.

							*#*
#			Same as "*", but search backward.  The pound sign
			(character 163) also works.  If the "#" key works as
			backspace, try using "stty erase <BS>" before starting
			Vim (<BS> is CTRL-H or a real backspace).  {not in Vi}

							*gstar*
g*			Like "*", but don't put "\<" and "\>" around the word.
			This makes the search also find matches that are not a
			whole word.  {not in Vi}

							*g#*
g#			Like "#", but don't put "\<" and "\>" around the word.
			This makes the search also find matches that are not a
			whole word.  {not in Vi}

							*gd*
gd			Goto local Declaration.  When the cursor is on a local
			variable, this command will jump to its declaration.
			First Vim searches for the start of the current
			function, just like "[[".  If it is not found the
			search stops in line 1.  If it is found, Vim goes back
			until a blank line is found.  From this position Vim
			searches for the keyword under the cursor, like with
			"*", but lines that look like a comment are ignored
			(see 'comments' option).
			Note that this is not guaranteed to work, Vim does not
			really check the syntax, it only searches for a match
			with the keyword.  If included files also need to be
			searched use the commands listed in |include-search|.
			After this command |n| searches forward for the next
			match (not backward).
			{not in Vi}

							*gD*
gD			Goto global Declaration.  When the cursor is on a
			global variable that is defined in the file, this
			command will jump to its declaration.  This works just
			like "gd", except that the search for the keyword
			always starts in line 1.  {not in Vi}

							*1gd*
1gd			Like "gd", but ignore matches inside a {} block that
			ends before the cursor position. {not in Vi}

							*1gD*
1gD			Like "gD", but ignore matches inside a {} block that
			ends before the cursor position. {not in Vi}

							*CTRL-C*
CTRL-C			Interrupt current (search) command.  Use CTRL-Break on
			MS-DOS |dos-CTRL-Break|.
			In Normal mode, any pending command is aborted.

							*:noh* *:nohlsearch*
:noh[lsearch]		Stop the highlighting for the 'hlsearch' option.  It
			is automatically turned back on when using a search
			command, or setting the 'hlsearch' option.
			This command doesn't work in an autocommand, because
			the highlighting state is saved and restored when
			executing autocommands |autocmd-searchpat|.
			Same thing for when invoking a user function.

While typing the search pattern the current match will be shown if the
'incsearch' option is on.  Remember that you still have to finish the search
command with <CR> to actually position the cursor at the displayed match.  Or
use <Esc> to abandon the search.

All matches for the last used search pattern will be highlighted if you set
the 'hlsearch' option.  This can be suspended with the |:nohlsearch| command.

When no match is found you get the error: *E486* Pattern not found
Note that for the |:global| command this behaves like a normal message, for Vi
compatibility.  For the |:s| command the "e" flag can be used to avoid the
error message |:s_flags|.

					*search-offset* *{offset}*
These commands search for the specified pattern.  With "/" and "?" an
additional offset may be given.  There are two types of offsets: line offsets
and character offsets.  {the character offsets are not in Vi}

The offset gives the cursor position relative to the found match:
    [num]	[num] lines downwards, in column 1
    +[num]	[num] lines downwards, in column 1
    -[num]	[num] lines upwards, in column 1
    e[+num]	[num] characters to the right of the end of the match
    e[-num]	[num] characters to the left of the end of the match
    s[+num]	[num] characters to the right of the start of the match
    s[-num]	[num] characters to the left of the start of the match
    b[+num]	[num] identical to s[+num] above (mnemonic: begin)
    b[-num]	[num] identical to s[-num] above (mnemonic: begin)
    ;{pattern}  perform another search, see |//;|

If a '-' or '+' is given but [num] is omitted, a count of one will be used.
When including an offset with 'e', the search becomes inclusive (the
character the cursor lands on is included in operations).

Examples:

pattern			cursor position	~
/test/+1		one line below "test", in column 1
/test/e			on the last t of "test"
/test/s+2		on the 's' of "test"
/test/b-3		three characters before "test"

If one of these commands is used after an operator, the characters between
the cursor position before and after the search is affected.  However, if a
line offset is given, the whole lines between the two cursor positions are
affected.

An example of how to search for matches with a pattern and change the match
with another word: >
	/foo<CR>	find "foo"
	c//e<CR>	change until end of match
	bar<Esc>	type replacement
	//<CR>		go to start of next match
	c//e<CR>	change until end of match
	beep<Esc>	type another replacement
			etc.
<
							*//;* *E386*
A very special offset is ';' followed by another search command.  For example: >

   /test 1/;/test
   /test.*/+1;?ing?

The first one first finds the next occurrence of "test 1", and then the first
occurrence of "test" after that.

This is like executing two search commands after each other, except that:
- It can be used as a single motion command after an operator.
- The direction for a following "n" or "N" command comes from the first
  search command.
- When an error occurs the cursor is not moved at all.

							*last-pattern*
The last used pattern and offset are remembered.  They can be used to repeat
the search, possibly in another direction or with another count.  Note that
two patterns are remembered: One for 'normal' search commands and one for the
substitute command ":s".  Each time an empty pattern is given, the previously
used pattern is used.  However, if there is no previous search command, a
previous substitute pattern is used, if possible.

The 'magic' option sticks with the last used pattern.  If you change 'magic',
this will not change how the last used pattern will be interpreted.
The 'ignorecase' option does not do this.  When 'ignorecase' is changed, it
will result in the pattern to match other text.

All matches for the last used search pattern will be highlighted if you set
the 'hlsearch' option.

To clear the last used search pattern: >
	:let @/ = ""
This will not set the pattern to an empty string, because that would match
everywhere.  The pattern is really cleared, like when starting Vim.

The search usually skips matches that don't move the cursor.  Whether the next
match is found at the next character or after the skipped match depends on the
'c' flag in 'cpoptions'.  See |cpo-c|.
	   with 'c' flag:   "/..." advances 1 to 3 characters
	without 'c' flag:   "/..." advances 1 character
The unpredictability with the 'c' flag is caused by starting the search in the
first column, skipping matches until one is found past the cursor position.

When searching backwards, searching starts at the start of the line, using the
'c' flag in 'cpoptions' as described above.  Then the last match before the
cursor position is used.

In Vi the ":tag" command sets the last search pattern when the tag is searched
for.  In Vim this is not done, the previous search pattern is still remembered,
unless the 't' flag is present in 'cpoptions'.  The search pattern is always
put in the search history.

If the 'wrapscan' option is on (which is the default), searches wrap around
the end of the buffer.  If 'wrapscan' is not set, the backward search stops
at the beginning and the forward search stops at the end of the buffer.  If
'wrapscan' is set and the pattern was not found the error message "pattern
not found" is given, and the cursor will not be moved.  If 'wrapscan' is not
set the message becomes "search hit BOTTOM without match" when searching
forward, or "search hit TOP without match" when searching backward.  If
wrapscan is set and the search wraps around the end of the file the message
"search hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" or "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at
TOP" is given when searching backwards or forwards respectively.  This can be
switched off by setting the 's' flag in the 'shortmess' option.  The highlight
method 'w' is used for this message (default: standout).

							*search-range*
You can limit the search command "/" to a certain range of lines by including
\%>l items.  For example, to match the word "limit" below line 199 and above
line 300: >
	/\%>199l\%<300llimit
Also see |/\%>l|.

Another way is to use the ":substitute" command with the 'c' flag.  Example: >
   :.,300s/Pattern//gc
This command will search from the cursor position until line 300 for
"Pattern".  At the match, you will be asked to type a character.  Type 'q' to
stop at this match, type 'n' to find the next match.

The "*", "#", "g*" and "g#" commands look for a word near the cursor in this
order, the first one that is found is used:
- The keyword currently under the cursor.
- The first keyword to the right of the cursor, in the same line.
- The WORD currently under the cursor.
- The first WORD to the right of the cursor, in the same line.
The keyword may only contain letters and characters in 'iskeyword'.
The WORD may contain any non-blanks (<Tab>s and/or <Space>s).
Note that if you type with ten fingers, the characters are easy to remember:
the "#" is under your left hand middle finger (search to the left and up) and
the "*" is under your right hand middle finger (search to the right and down).
(this depends on your keyboard layout though).

==============================================================================
2. The definition of a pattern		*search-pattern* *pattern* *[pattern]*
					*regular-expression* *regexp* *Pattern*
					*E76* *E383* *E476*

For starters, read chapter 27 of the user manual |usr_27.txt|.

						*/bar* */\bar* */pattern*
1. A pattern is one or more branches, separated by "\|".  It matches anything
   that matches one of the branches.  Example: "foo\|beep" matches "foo" and
   matches "beep".  If more than one branch matches, the first one is used.

   pattern ::=	    branch
		or  branch \| branch
		or  branch \| branch \| branch
		etc.

						*/branch* */\&*
2. A branch is one or more concats, separated by "\&".  It matches the last
   concat, but only if all the preceding concats also match at the same
   position.  Examples:
	"foobeep\&..." matches "foo" in "foobeep".
	".*Peter\&.*Bob" matches in a line containing both "Peter" and "Bob"

   branch ::=	    concat
		or  concat \& concat
		or  concat \& concat \& concat
		etc.

						*/concat*
3. A concat is one or more pieces, concatenated.  It matches a match for the
   first piece, followed by a match for the second piece, etc.  Example:
   "f[0-9]b", first matches "f", then a digit and then "b".

   concat  ::=	    piece
		or  piece piece
		or  piece piece piece
		etc.

						*/piece*
4. A piece is an atom, possibly followed by a multi, an indication of how many
   times the atom can be matched.  Example: "a*" matches any sequence of "a"
   characters: "", "a", "aa", etc.  See |/multi|.

   piece   ::=	    atom
		or  atom  multi

						*/atom*
5. An atom can be one of a long list of items.  Many atoms match one character
   in the text.  It is often an ordinary character or a character class.
   Braces can be used to make a pattern into an atom.  The "\z(\)" construct
   is only for syntax highlighting.

   atom    ::=	    ordinary-atom		|/ordinary-atom|
		or  \( pattern \)		|/\(|
		or  \%( pattern \)		|/\%(|
		or  \z( pattern \)		|/\z(|


				*/\%#=* *two-engines* *NFA*
Vim includes two regexp engines:
1. An old, backtracking engine that supports everything.
2. A new, NFA engine that works much faster on some patterns, possibly slower
   on some patterns.

Vim will automatically select the right engine for you.  However, if you run
into a problem or want to specifically select one engine or the other, you can
prepend one of the following to the pattern:

	\%#=0	Force automatic selection.  Only has an effect when
	        'regexpengine' has been set to a non-zero value.
	\%#=1	Force using the old engine.
	\%#=2	Force using the NFA engine.

You can also use the 'regexpengine' option to change the default.

			 *E864* *E868* *E874* *E875* *E876* *E877* *E878*
If selecting the NFA engine and it runs into something that is not implemented
the pattern will not match.  This is only useful when debugging Vim.

==============================================================================
3. Magic							*/magic*

Some characters in the pattern are taken literally.  They match with the same
character in the text.  When preceded with a backslash however, these
characters get a special meaning.

Other characters have a special meaning without a backslash.  They need to be
preceded with a backslash to match literally.

If a character is taken literally or not depends on the 'magic' option and the
items mentioned next.
							*/\m* */\M*
Use of "\m" makes the pattern after it be interpreted as if 'magic' is set,
ignoring the actual value of the 'magic' option.
Use of "\M" makes the pattern after it be interpreted as if 'nomagic' is used.
							*/\v* */\V*
Use of "\v" means that in the pattern after it all ASCII characters except
'0'-'9', 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z' and '_' have a special meaning.  "very magic"

Use of "\V" means that in the pattern after it only the backslash and the
terminating character (/ or ?) has a special meaning.  "very nomagic"

Examples:
after:	  \v	   \m	    \M	     \V		matches ~
		'magic' 'nomagic'
	  $	   $	    $	     \$		matches end-of-line
	  .	   .	    \.	     \.		matches any character
	  *	   *	    \*	     \*		any number of the previous atom
	  ~	   ~	    \~	     \~		latest substitute string
	  ()	   \(\)     \(\)     \(\)	grouping into an atom
	  |	   \|	    \|	     \|		separating alternatives
	  \a	   \a	    \a	     \a		alphabetic character
	  \\	   \\	    \\	     \\		literal backslash
	  \.	   \.	    .	     .		literal dot
	  \{	   {	    {	     {		literal '{'
	  a	   a	    a	     a		literal 'a'

{only Vim supports \m, \M, \v and \V}

It is recommended to always keep the 'magic' option at the default setting,
which is 'magic'.  This avoids portability problems.  To make a pattern immune
to the 'magic' option being set or not, put "\m" or "\M" at the start of the
pattern.

==============================================================================
5. Multi items						*pattern-multi-items*

An atom can be followed by an indication of how many times the atom can be
matched and in what way.  This is called a multi.  See |/multi| for an
overview.

							*/star* */\star*
*	(use \* when 'magic' is not set)
	Matches 0 or more of the preceding atom, as many as possible.
	Example  'nomagic'	matches ~
	a*	   a\*		"", "a", "aa", "aaa", etc.
	.*	   \.\*		anything, also an empty string, no end-of-line
	\_.*	   \_.\*	everything up to the end of the buffer
	\_.*END	   \_.\*END	everything up to and including the last "END"
				in the buffer

	Exception: When "*" is used at the start of the pattern or just after
	"^" it matches the star character.

	Be aware that repeating "\_." can match a lot of text and take a long
	time.  For example, "\_.*END" matches all text from the current
	position to the last occurrence of "END" in the file.  Since the "*"
	will match as many as possible, this first skips over all lines until
	the end of the file and then tries matching "END", backing up one
	character at a time.

							*/\+*
\+	Matches 1 or more of the preceding atom, as many as possible. {not in
	Vi}
	Example		matches ~
	^.\+$		any non-empty line
	\s\+		white space of at least one character

							*/\=*
\=	Matches 0 or 1 of the preceding atom, as many as possible. {not in Vi}
	Example		matches ~
	foo\=		"fo" and "foo"

							*/\?*
\?	Just like \=.  Cannot be used when searching backwards with the "?"
	command. {not in Vi}

					*/\{* *E60* *E554* *E870*
\{n,m}	Matches n to m of the preceding atom, as many as possible
\{n}	Matches n of the preceding atom
\{n,}	Matches at least n of the preceding atom, as many as possible
\{,m}	Matches 0 to m of the preceding atom, as many as possible
\{}	Matches 0 or more of the preceding atom, as many as possible (like *)
							*/\{-*
\{-n,m}	matches n to m of the preceding atom, as few as possible
\{-n}	matches n of the preceding atom
\{-n,}	matches at least n of the preceding atom, as few as possible
\{-,m}	matches 0 to m of the preceding atom, as few as possible
\{-}	matches 0 or more of the preceding atom, as few as possible
	{Vi does not have any of these}

	n and m are positive decimal numbers or zero
								*non-greedy*
	If a "-" appears immediately after the "{", then a shortest match
	first algorithm is used (see example below).  In particular, "\{-}" is
	the same as "*" but uses the shortest match first algorithm.  BUT: A
	match that starts earlier is preferred over a shorter match: "a\{-}b"
	matches "aaab" in "xaaab".

	Example			matches ~
	ab\{2,3}c		"abbc" or "abbbc"
	a\{5}			"aaaaa"
	ab\{2,}c		"abbc", "abbbc", "abbbbc", etc.
	ab\{,3}c		"ac", "abc", "abbc" or "abbbc"
	a[bc]\{3}d		"abbbd", "abbcd", "acbcd", "acccd", etc.
	a\(bc\)\{1,2}d		"abcd" or "abcbcd"
	a[bc]\{-}[cd]		"abc" in "abcd"
	a[bc]*[cd]		"abcd" in "abcd"

	The } may optionally be preceded with a backslash: \{n,m\}.

							*/\@=*
\@=	Matches the preceding atom with zero width. {not in Vi}
	Like "(?=pattern)" in Perl.
	Example			matches ~
	foo\(bar\)\@=		"foo" in "foobar"
	foo\(bar\)\@=foo	nothing
							*/zero-width*
	When using "\@=" (or "^", "$", "\<", "\>") no characters are included
	in the match.  These items are only used to check if a match can be
	made.  This can be tricky, because a match with following items will
	be done in the same position.  The last example above will not match
	"foobarfoo", because it tries match "foo" in the same position where
	"bar" matched.

	Note that using "\&" works the same as using "\@=": "foo\&.." is the
	same as "\(foo\)\@=..".  But using "\&" is easier, you don't need the
	braces.


							*/\@!*
\@!	Matches with zero width if the preceding atom does NOT match at the
	current position. |/zero-width| {not in Vi}
	Like "(?!pattern)" in Perl.
	Example			matches ~
	foo\(bar\)\@!		any "foo" not followed by "bar"
	a.\{-}p\@!		"a", "ap", "app", "appp", etc. not immediately
				followed by a "p"
	if \(\(then\)\@!.\)*$	"if " not followed by "then"

	Using "\@!" is tricky, because there are many places where a pattern
	does not match.  "a.*p\@!" will match from an "a" to the end of the
	line, because ".*" can match all characters in the line and the "p"
	doesn't match at the end of the line.  "a.\{-}p\@!" will match any
	"a", "ap", "app", etc. that isn't followed by a "p", because the "."
	can match a "p" and "p\@!" doesn't match after that.

	You can't use "\@!" to look for a non-match before the matching
	position: "\(foo\)\@!bar" will match "bar" in "foobar", because at the
	position where "bar" matches, "foo" does not match.  To avoid matching
	"foobar" you could use "\(foo\)\@!...bar", but that doesn't match a
	bar at the start of a line.  Use "\(foo\)\@<!bar".

	Useful example: to find "foo" in a line that does not contain "bar": >
		/^\%(.*bar\)\@!.*\zsfoo
<	This pattern first checks that there is not a single position in the
	line where "bar" matches.  If ".*bar" matches somewhere the \@! will
	reject the pattern.  When there is no match any "foo" will be found.
	The "\zs" is to have the match start just before "foo".

							*/\@<=*
\@<=	Matches with zero width if the preceding atom matches just before what
	follows. |/zero-width| {not in Vi}
	Like "(?<=pattern)" in Perl, but Vim allows non-fixed-width patterns.
	Example			matches ~
	\(an\_s\+\)\@<=file	"file" after "an" and white space or an
				end-of-line
	For speed it's often much better to avoid this multi.  Try using "\zs"
	instead |/\zs|.  To match the same as the above example:
		an\_s\+\zsfile
	At least set a limit for the look-behind, see below.

	"\@<=" and "\@<!" check for matches just before what follows.
	Theoretically these matches could start anywhere before this position.
	But to limit the time needed, only the line where what follows matches
	is searched, and one line before that (if there is one).  This should
	be sufficient to match most things and not be too slow.

	In the old regexp engine the part of the pattern after "\@<=" and
	"\@<!" are checked for a match first, thus things like "\1" don't work
	to reference \(\) inside the preceding atom.  It does work the other
	way around:
	Bad example			matches ~
	\%#=1\1\@<=,\([a-z]\+\)		",abc" in "abc,abc"

	However, the new regexp engine works differently, it is better to not
	rely on this behavior, do not use \@<= if it can be avoided:
	Example				matches ~
	\([a-z]\+\)\zs,\1		",abc" in "abc,abc"

\@123<=
	Like "\@<=" but only look back 123 bytes. This avoids trying lots
	of matches that are known to fail and make executing the pattern very
	slow.  Example, check if there is a "<" just before "span":
		/<\@1<=span
	This will try matching "<" only one byte before "span", which is the
	only place that works anyway.
	After crossing a line boundary, the limit is relative to the end of
	the line.  Thus the characters at the start of the line with the match
	are not counted (this is just to keep it simple).
	The number zero is the same as no limit.

							*/\@<!*
\@<!	Matches with zero width if the preceding atom does NOT match just
	before what follows.  Thus this matches if there is no position in the
	current or previous line where the atom matches such that it ends just
	before what follows.  |/zero-width| {not in Vi}
	Like "(?<!pattern)" in Perl, but Vim allows non-fixed-width patterns.
	The match with the preceding atom is made to end just before the match
	with what follows, thus an atom that ends in ".*" will work.
	Warning: This can be slow (because many positions need to be checked
	for a match).  Use a limit if you can, see below.
	Example			matches ~
	\(foo\)\@<!bar		any "bar" that's not in "foobar"
	\(\/\/.*\)\@<!in	"in" which is not after "//"

\@123<!
	Like "\@<!" but only look back 123 bytes. This avoids trying lots of
	matches that are known to fail and make executing the pattern very
	slow.

							*/\@>*
\@>	Matches the preceding atom like matching a whole pattern. {not in Vi}
	Like "(?>pattern)" in Perl.
	Example		matches ~
	\(a*\)\@>a	nothing (the "a*" takes all the "a"'s, there can't be
			another one following)

	This matches the preceding atom as if it was a pattern by itself.  If
	it doesn't match, there is no retry with shorter sub-matches or
	anything.  Observe this difference: "a*b" and "a*ab" both match
	"aaab", but in the second case the "a*" matches only the first two
	"a"s.  "\(a*\)\@>ab" will not match "aaab", because the "a*" matches
	the "aaa" (as many "a"s as possible), thus the "ab" can't match.


==============================================================================
6.  Ordinary atoms					*pattern-atoms*

An ordinary atom can be:

							*/^*
^	At beginning of pattern or after "\|", "\(", "\%(" or "\n": matches
	start-of-line; at other positions, matches literal '^'. |/zero-width|
	Example		matches ~
	^beep(		the start of the C function "beep" (probably).

							*/\^*
\^	Matches literal '^'.  Can be used at any position in the pattern.

							*/\_^*
\_^	Matches start-of-line. |/zero-width|  Can be used at any position in
	the pattern.
	Example		matches ~
	\_s*\_^foo	white space and blank lines and then "foo" at
			start-of-line

							*/$*
$	At end of pattern or in front of "\|", "\)" or "\n" ('magic' on):
	matches end-of-line <EOL>; at other positions, matches literal '$'.
	|/zero-width|

							*/\$*
\$	Matches literal '$'.  Can be used at any position in the pattern.

							*/\_$*
\_$	Matches end-of-line. |/zero-width|  Can be used at any position in the
	pattern.  Note that "a\_$b" never matches, since "b" cannot match an
	end-of-line.  Use "a\nb" instead |/\n|.
	Example		matches ~
	foo\_$\_s*	"foo" at end-of-line and following white space and
			blank lines

.	(with 'nomagic': \.)				*/.* */\.*
	Matches any single character, but not an end-of-line.

							*/\_.*
\_.	Matches any single character or end-of-line.
	Careful: "\_.*" matches all text to the end of the buffer!

							*/\<*
\<	Matches the beginning of a word: The next char is the first char of a
	word.  The 'iskeyword' option specifies what is a word character.
	|/zero-width|

							*/\>*
\>	Matches the end of a word: The previous char is the last char of a
	word.  The 'iskeyword' option specifies what is a word character.
	|/zero-width|

							*/\zs*
\zs	Matches at any position, and sets the start of the match there: The
	next char is the first char of the whole match. |/zero-width|
	Example: >
		/^\s*\zsif
<	matches an "if" at the start of a line, ignoring white space.
	Can be used multiple times, the last one encountered in a matching
	branch is used.  Example: >
		/\(.\{-}\zsFab\)\{3}
<	Finds the third occurrence of "Fab".
	This cannot be followed by a multi. *E888*
	{not in Vi} {not available when compiled without the |+syntax| feature}
							*/\ze*
\ze	Matches at any position, and sets the end of the match there: The
	previous char is the last char of the whole match. |/zero-width|
	Can be used multiple times, the last one encountered in a matching
	branch is used.
	Example: "end\ze\(if\|for\)" matches the "end" in "endif" and
	"endfor".
	This cannot be followed by a multi. |E888|
	{not in Vi} {not available when compiled without the |+syntax| feature}

						*/\%^* *start-of-file*
\%^	Matches start of the file.  When matching with a string, matches the
	start of the string. {not in Vi}
	For example, to find the first "VIM" in a file: >
		/\%^\_.\{-}\zsVIM
<
						*/\%$* *end-of-file*
\%$	Matches end of the file.  When matching with a string, matches the
	end of the string. {not in Vi}
	Note that this does NOT find the last "VIM" in a file: >
		/VIM\_.\{-}\%$
<	It will find the next VIM, because the part after it will always
	match.  This one will find the last "VIM" in the file: >
		/VIM\ze\(\(VIM\)\@!\_.\)*\%$
<	This uses |/\@!| to ascertain that "VIM" does NOT match in any
	position after the first "VIM".
	Searching from the end of the file backwards is easier!

						*/\%V*
\%V	Match inside the Visual area.  When Visual mode has already been
	stopped match in the area that |gv| would reselect.
	This is a |/zero-width| match.  To make sure the whole pattern is
	inside the Visual area put it at the start and end of the pattern,
	e.g.: >
		/\%Vfoo.*bar\%V
<	Only works for the current buffer.

						*/\%#* *cursor-position*
\%#	Matches with the cursor position.  Only works when matching in a
	buffer displayed in a window. {not in Vi}
	WARNING: When the cursor is moved after the pattern was used, the
	result becomes invalid.  Vim doesn't automatically update the matches.
	This is especially relevant for syntax highlighting and 'hlsearch'.
	In other words: When the cursor moves the display isn't updated for
	this change.  An update is done for lines which are changed (the whole
	line is updated) or when using the |CTRL-L| command (the whole screen
	is updated).  Example, to highlight the word under the cursor: >
		/\k*\%#\k*
<	When 'hlsearch' is set and you move the cursor around and make changes
	this will clearly show when the match is updated or not.

						*/\%'m* */\%<'m* */\%>'m*
\%'m	Matches with the position of mark m.
\%<'m	Matches before the position of mark m.
\%>'m	Matches after the position of mark m.
	Example, to highlight the text from mark 's to 'e: >
		/.\%>'s.*\%<'e..
<	Note that two dots are required to include mark 'e in the match.  That
	is because "\%<'e" matches at the character before the 'e mark, and
	since it's a |/zero-width| match it doesn't include that character.
	{not in Vi}
	WARNING: When the mark is moved after the pattern was used, the result
	becomes invalid.  Vim doesn't automatically update the matches.
	Similar to moving the cursor for "\%#" |/\%#|.

						*/\%l* */\%>l* */\%<l*
\%23l	Matches in a specific line.
\%<23l	Matches above a specific line (lower line number).
\%>23l	Matches below a specific line (higher line number).
	These three can be used to match specific lines in a buffer.  The "23"
	can be any line number.  The first line is 1. {not in Vi}
	WARNING: When inserting or deleting lines Vim does not automatically
	update the matches.  This means Syntax highlighting quickly becomes
	wrong.
	Example, to highlight the line where the cursor currently is: >
		:exe '/\%' . line(".") . 'l.*'
<	When 'hlsearch' is set and you move the cursor around and make changes
	this will clearly show when the match is updated or not.

						*/\%c* */\%>c* */\%<c*
\%23c	Matches in a specific column.
\%<23c	Matches before a specific column.
\%>23c	Matches after a specific column.
	These three can be used to match specific columns in a buffer or
	string.  The "23" can be any column number.  The first column is 1.
	Actually, the column is the byte number (thus it's not exactly right
	for multi-byte characters).  {not in Vi}
	WARNING: When inserting or deleting text Vim does not automatically
	update the matches.  This means Syntax highlighting quickly becomes
	wrong.
	Example, to highlight the column where the cursor currently is: >
		:exe '/\%' . col(".") . 'c'
<	When 'hlsearch' is set and you move the cursor around and make changes
	this will clearly show when the match is updated or not.
	Example for matching a single byte in column 44: >
		/\%>43c.\%<46c
<	Note that "\%<46c" matches in column 45 when the "." matches a byte in
	column 44.
						*/\%v* */\%>v* */\%<v*
\%23v	Matches in a specific virtual column.
\%<23v	Matches before a specific virtual column.
\%>23v	Matches after a specific virtual column.
	These three can be used to match specific virtual columns in a buffer
	or string.  When not matching with a buffer in a window, the option
	values of the current window are used (e.g., 'tabstop').
	The "23" can be any column number.  The first column is 1.
	Note that some virtual column positions will never match, because they
	are halfway through a tab or other character that occupies more than
	one screen character.  {not in Vi}
	WARNING: When inserting or deleting text Vim does not automatically
	update highlighted matches.  This means Syntax highlighting quickly
	becomes wrong.
	Example, to highlight all the characters after virtual column 72: >
		/\%>72v.*
<	When 'hlsearch' is set and you move the cursor around and make changes
	this will clearly show when the match is updated or not.
	To match the text up to column 17: >
		/^.*\%17v
<	Column 17 is not included, because this is a |/zero-width| match. To
	include the column use: >
		/^.*\%17v.
<	This command does the same thing, but also matches when there is no
	character in column 17: >
		/^.*\%<18v.
<	Note that without the "^" to anchor the match in the first column,
	this will also highlight column 17: >
		/.*\%17v
<	Column 17 is highlighted by 'hlsearch' because there is another match
	where ".*" matches zero characters.
<

Character classes: {not in Vi}
\i	identifier character (see 'isident' option)	*/\i*
\I	like "\i", but excluding digits			*/\I*

	NOTE: Using the atom is faster than the [] form.

	NOTE: 'ignorecase', "\c" and "\C" are not used by character classes.

			*/\_* *E63* */\_i* */\_I* */\_k* */\_K* */\_f* */\_F*

			*/\_l* */\_L* */\_u* */\_U*
\_x	Where "x" is any of the characters above: The character class with
	end-of-line added
(end of character classes)

\e	matches <Esc>					*/\e*
\t	matches <Tab>					*/\t*
\r	matches <CR>					*/\r*
\b	matches <BS>					*/\b*
\n	matches an end-of-line				*/\n*
	When matching in a string instead of buffer text a literal newline
	character is matched.

~	matches the last given substitute string	*/~* */\~*

\(\)	A pattern enclosed by escaped parentheses.	*/\(* */\(\)* */\)*
	E.g., "\(^a\)" matches 'a' at the start of a line.
	*E51* *E54* *E55* *E872* *E873*

\1      Matches the same string that was matched by	*/\1* *E65*
	the first sub-expression in \( and \). {not in Vi}
	Example: "\([a-z]\).\1" matches "ata", "ehe", "tot", etc.
\2      Like "\1", but uses second sub-expression,	*/\2*
   ...							*/\3*
\9      Like "\1", but uses ninth sub-expression.	*/\9*
	Note: The numbering of groups is done based on which "\(" comes first
	in the pattern (going left to right), NOT based on what is matched
	first.

\%(\)	A pattern enclosed by escaped parentheses.	*/\%(\)* */\%(* *E53*
	Just like \(\), but without counting it as a sub-expression.  This
	allows using more groups and it's a little bit faster.
	{not in Vi}

x	A single character, with no special meaning, matches itself

							*/\* */\\*
\x	A backslash followed by a single character, with no special meaning,
	is reserved for future expansions

[]	(with 'nomagic': \[])		*/[]* */\[]* */\_[]* */collection*
\_[]
	A collection.  This is a sequence of characters enclosed in brackets.
	It matches any single character in the collection.
	Example		matches ~
	[xyz]		any 'x', 'y' or 'z'
	[a-zA-Z]$	any alphabetic character at the end of a line
	\c[a-z]$	same
	[А-яЁё]		Russian alphabet (with utf-8 and cp1251)

								*/[\n]*
	With "\_" prepended the collection also includes the end-of-line.
	The same can be done by including "\n" in the collection.  The
	end-of-line is also matched when the collection starts with "^"!  Thus
	"\_[^ab]" matches the end-of-line and any character but "a" and "b".
	This makes it Vi compatible: Without the "\_" or "\n" the collection
	does not match an end-of-line.
								*E769*
	When the ']' is not there Vim will not give an error message but
	assume no collection is used.  Useful to search for '['.  However, you
	do get E769 for internal searching.  And be aware that in a
	`:substitute` command the whole command becomes the pattern.  E.g.
	":s/[/x/" searches for "[/x" and replaces it with nothing.  It does
	not search for "[" and replaces it with "x"!

	If the sequence begins with "^", it matches any single character NOT
	in the collection: "[^xyz]" matches anything but 'x', 'y' and 'z'.
	- If two characters in the sequence are separated by '-', this is
	  shorthand for the full list of ASCII characters between them.  E.g.,
	  "[0-9]" matches any decimal digit.  Non-ASCII characters can be
	  used, but the character values must not be more than 256 apart.
	- A character class expression is evaluated to the set of characters
	  belonging to that character class.  The following character classes
	  are supported:
			  Name		Contents ~
*[:alnum:]*		  [:alnum:]     ASCII letters and digits
*[:alpha:]*		  [:alpha:]     ASCII letters
*[:blank:]*		  [:blank:]     space and tab characters
*[:cntrl:]*		  [:cntrl:]     control characters
*[:digit:]*		  [:digit:]     decimal digits
*[:graph:]*		  [:graph:]     printable characters excluding space
*[:lower:]*		  [:lower:]     lowercase letters (all letters when
					'ignorecase' is used)
*[:print:]*		  [:print:]     printable characters including space
*[:punct:]*		  [:punct:]     ASCII punctuation characters
*[:space:]*		  [:space:]     whitespace characters
*[:upper:]*		  [:upper:]     uppercase letters (all letters when
					'ignorecase' is used)
*[:xdigit:]*		  [:xdigit:]    hexadecimal digits
*[:return:]*		  [:return:]	the <CR> character
*[:tab:]*		  [:tab:]	the <Tab> character
*[:escape:]*		  [:escape:]	the <Esc> character
*[:backspace:]*		  [:backspace:]	the <BS> character
	  The brackets in character class expressions are additional to the
	  brackets delimiting a collection.  For example, the following is a
	  plausible pattern for a UNIX filename: "[-./[:alnum:]_~]\+" That is,
	  a list of at least one character, each of which is either '-', '.',
	  '/', alphabetic, numeric, '_' or '~'.
	  These items only work for 8-bit characters, except [:lower:] and
	  [:upper:] also work for multi-byte characters when using the new
	  regexp engine.  See |two-engines|.  In the future these items may
	  work for multi-byte characters.  For now, to get all "alpha"
	  characters you can use: [[:lower:][:upper:]].
							*/[[=* *[==]*
	- An equivalence class.  This means that characters are matched that
	  have almost the same meaning, e.g., when ignoring accents.  This
	  only works for Unicode, latin1 and latin9.  The form is:
		[=a=]
							*/[[.* *[..]*
	- A collation element.  This currently simply accepts a single
	  character in the form:
		[.a.]
							  */\]*
	- To include a literal ']', '^', '-' or '\' in the collection, put a
	  backslash before it: "[xyz\]]", "[\^xyz]", "[xy\-z]" and "[xyz\\]".
	  (Note: POSIX does not support the use of a backslash this way).  For
	  ']' you can also make it the first character (following a possible
	  "^"):  "[]xyz]" or "[^]xyz]" {not in Vi}.
	  For '-' you can also make it the first or last character: "[-xyz]",
	  "[^-xyz]" or "[xyz-]".  For '\' you can also let it be followed by
	  any character that's not in "^]-\bdertnoUux".  "[\xyz]" matches '\',
	  'x', 'y' and 'z'.  It's better to use "\\" though, future expansions
	  may use other characters after '\'.
	- Omitting the trailing ] is not considered an error. "[]" works like
	  "[]]", it matches the ']' character.
	- The following translations are accepted when the 'l' flag is not
	  included in 'cpoptions' {not in Vi}:
		\e	<Esc>
		\t	<Tab>
		\r	<CR>	(NOT end-of-line!)
		\b	<BS>
		\n	line break, see above |/[\n]|
		\d123	decimal number of character
		\o40	octal number of character up to 0377
		\x20	hexadecimal number of character up to 0xff
		\u20AC	hex. number of multibyte character up to 0xffff
		\U1234	hex. number of multibyte character up to 0xffffffff
	  NOTE: The other backslash codes mentioned above do not work inside
	  []!
	- Matching with a collection can be slow, because each character in
	  the text has to be compared with each character in the collection.
	  Use one of the other atoms above when possible.  Example: "\d" is
	  much faster than "[0-9]" and matches the same characters.

						*/\%[]* *E69* *E70* *E369*
\%[]	A sequence of optionally matched atoms.  This always matches.
	It matches as much of the list of atoms it contains as possible.  Thus
	it stops at the first atom that doesn't match.  For example: >
		/r\%[ead]
<	matches "r", "re", "rea" or "read".  The longest that matches is used.
	To match the Ex command "function", where "fu" is required and
	"nction" is optional, this would work: >
		/\<fu\%[nction]\>
<	The end-of-word atom "\>" is used to avoid matching "fu" in "full".
	It gets more complicated when the atoms are not ordinary characters.
	You don't often have to use it, but it is possible.  Example: >
		/\<r\%[[eo]ad]\>
<	Matches the words "r", "re", "ro", "rea", "roa", "read" and "road".
	There can be no \(\), \%(\) or \z(\) items inside the [] and \%[] does
	not nest.
	To include a "[" use "[[]" and for "]" use []]", e.g.,: >
		/index\%[[[]0[]]]
<	matches "index" "index[", "index[0" and "index[0]".
	{not available when compiled without the |+syntax| feature}

				*/\%d* */\%x* */\%o* */\%u* */\%U* *E678*

\%d123	Matches the character specified with a decimal number.  Must be
	followed by a non-digit.
\%o40	Matches the character specified with an octal number up to 0377.
	Numbers below 040 must be followed by a non-octal digit or a non-digit.
\%x2a	Matches the character specified with up to two hexadecimal characters.
\%u20AC	Matches the character specified with up to four hexadecimal
	characters.
\%U1234abcd	Matches the character specified with up to eight hexadecimal
	characters.

==============================================================================
7. Ignoring case in a pattern					*/ignorecase*

If the 'ignorecase' option is on, the case of normal letters is ignored.
'smartcase' can be set to ignore case when the pattern contains lowercase
letters only.
							*/\c* */\C*
When "\c" appears anywhere in the pattern, the whole pattern is handled like
'ignorecase' is on.  The actual value of 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' is
ignored.  "\C" does the opposite: Force matching case for the whole pattern.
{only Vim supports \c and \C}
Note that 'ignorecase', "\c" and "\C" are not used for the character classes.

Examples:
      pattern	'ignorecase'  'smartcase'	matches ~
	foo	  off		-		foo
	foo	  on		-		foo Foo FOO
	Foo	  on		off		foo Foo FOO
	Foo	  on		on		    Foo
	\cfoo	  -		-		foo Foo FOO
	foo\C	  -		-		foo

Technical detail:				*NL-used-for-Nul*
<Nul> characters in the file are stored as <NL> in memory.  In the display
they are shown as "^@".  The translation is done when reading and writing
files.  To match a <Nul> with a search pattern you can just enter CTRL-@ or
"CTRL-V 000".  This is probably just what you expect.  Internally the
character is replaced with a <NL> in the search pattern.  What is unusual is
that typing CTRL-V CTRL-J also inserts a <NL>, thus also searches for a <Nul>
in the file.  {Vi cannot handle <Nul> characters in the file at all}

						*CR-used-for-NL*
When 'fileformat' is "mac", <NL> characters in the file are stored as <CR>
characters internally.  In the text they are shown as "^J".  Otherwise this
works similar to the usage of <NL> for a <Nul>.

When working with expression evaluation, a <NL> character in the pattern
matches a <NL> in the string.  The use of "\n" (backslash n) to match a <NL>
doesn't work there, it only works to match text in the buffer.

						*pattern-multi-byte*
Patterns will also work with multi-byte characters, mostly as you would
expect.  But invalid bytes may cause trouble, a pattern with an invalid byte
will probably never match.

==============================================================================
8. Composing characters					*patterns-composing*

							*/\Z*
When "\Z" appears anywhere in the pattern, all composing characters are
ignored.  Thus only the base characters need to match, the composing
characters may be different and the number of composing characters may differ.
Only relevant when 'encoding' is "utf-8".
Exception: If the pattern starts with one or more composing characters, these
must match.
							*/\%C*
Use "\%C" to skip any composing characters.  For example, the pattern "a" does
not match in "càt" (where the a has the composing character 0x0300), but
"a\%C" does.  Note that this does not match "cát" (where the á is character
0xe1, it does not have a compositing character).  It does match "cat" (where
the a is just an a).

When a composing character appears at the start of the pattern of after an
item that doesn't include the composing character, a match is found at any
character that includes this composing character.

When using a dot and a composing character, this works the same as the
composing character by itself, except that it doesn't matter what comes before
this.

The order of composing characters does not matter.  Also, the text may have
more composing characters than the pattern, it still matches.  But all
composing characters in the pattern must be found in the text.

Suppose B is a base character and x and y are composing characters:
	pattern		text		match ~
	Bxy		Bxy		yes (perfect match)
	Bxy		Byx		yes (order ignored)
	Bxy		By		no (x missing)
	Bxy		Bx		no (y missing)
	Bx		Bx		yes (perfect match)
	Bx		By		no (x missing)
	Bx		Bxy		yes (extra y ignored)
	Bx		Byx		yes (extra y ignored)

==============================================================================
9. Compare with Perl patterns				*perl-patterns*

Vim's regexes are most similar to Perl's, in terms of what you can do.  The
difference between them is mostly just notation;  here's a summary of where
they differ:

Capability			in Vimspeak	in Perlspeak ~
----------------------------------------------------------------
force case insensitivity	\c		(?i)
force case sensitivity		\C		(?-i)
backref-less grouping		\%(atom\)	(?:atom)
conservative quantifiers	\{-n,m}		*?, +?, ??, {}?
0-width match			atom\@=		(?=atom)
0-width non-match		atom\@!		(?!atom)
0-width preceding match		atom\@<=	(?<=atom)
0-width preceding non-match	atom\@<!	(?<!atom)
match without retry		atom\@>		(?>atom)

Vim and Perl handle newline characters inside a string a bit differently:

In Perl, ^ and $ only match at the very beginning and end of the text,
by default, but you can set the 'm' flag, which lets them match at
embedded newlines as well.  You can also set the 's' flag, which causes
a . to match newlines as well.  (Both these flags can be changed inside
a pattern using the same syntax used for the i flag above, BTW.)

On the other hand, Vim's ^ and $ always match at embedded newlines, and
you get two separate atoms, \%^ and \%$, which only match at the very
start and end of the text, respectively.  Vim solves the second problem
by giving you the \_ "modifier":  put it in front of a . or a character
class, and they will match newlines as well.

Finally, these constructs are unique to Perl:
- execution of arbitrary code in the regex:  (?{perl code})
- conditional expressions:  (?(condition)true-expr|false-expr)

...and these are unique to Vim:
- changing the magic-ness of a pattern:  \v \V \m \M
   (very useful for avoiding backslashitis)
- sequence of optionally matching atoms:  \%[atoms]
- \& (which is to \| what "and" is to "or";  it forces several branches
   to match at one spot)
- matching lines/columns by number:  \%5l \%5c \%5v
- setting the start and end of the match:  \zs \ze

==============================================================================
10. Highlighting matches				*match-highlight*

							*:mat* *:match*
:mat[ch] {group} /{pattern}/
		Define a pattern to highlight in the current window.  It will
		be highlighted with {group}.  Example: >
			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
			:match MyGroup /TODO/
<		Instead of // any character can be used to mark the start and
		end of the {pattern}.  Watch out for using special characters,
		such as '"' and '|'.

		{group} must exist at the moment this command is executed.

		The {group} highlighting still applies when a character is
		to be highlighted for 'hlsearch', as the highlighting for
		matches is given higher priority than that of 'hlsearch'.
		Syntax highlighting (see 'syntax') is also overruled by
		matches.

		Note that highlighting the last used search pattern with
		'hlsearch' is used in all windows, while the pattern defined
		with ":match" only exists in the current window.  It is kept
		when switching to another buffer.

		'ignorecase' does not apply, use |/\c| in the pattern to
		ignore case.  Otherwise case is not ignored.

		'redrawtime' defines the maximum time searched for pattern
		matches.

		When matching end-of-line and Vim redraws only part of the
		display you may get unexpected results.  That is because Vim
		looks for a match in the line where redrawing starts.

		Also see |matcharg()| and |getmatches()|. The former returns
		the highlight group and pattern of a previous |:match|
		command.  The latter returns a list with highlight groups and
		patterns defined by both |matchadd()| and |:match|.

		Highlighting matches using |:match| are limited to three
		matches (aside from |:match|, |:2match| and |:3match| are
		available). |matchadd()| does not have this limitation and in
		addition makes it possible to prioritize matches.

		Another example, which highlights all characters in virtual
		column 72 and more: >
			:highlight rightMargin term=bold ctermfg=blue guifg=blue
			:match rightMargin /.\%>72v/
<		To highlight all character that are in virtual column 7: >
			:highlight col8 ctermbg=grey guibg=grey
			:match col8 /\%<8v.\%>7v/
<		Note the use of two items to also match a character that
		occupies more than one virtual column, such as a TAB.

:mat[ch]
:mat[ch] none
		Clear a previously defined match pattern.


:2mat[ch] {group} /{pattern}/					*:2match*
:2mat[ch]
:2mat[ch] none
:3mat[ch] {group} /{pattern}/					*:3match*
:3mat[ch]
:3mat[ch] none
		Just like |:match| above, but set a separate match.  Thus
		there can be three matches active at the same time.  The match
		with the lowest number has priority if several match at the
		same position.
		The ":3match" command is used by the |matchparen| plugin.  You
		are suggested to use ":match" for manual matching and
		":2match" for another plugin.

Getscript is a plugin that simplifies retrieval of the latest versions of the
scripts that you yourself use!  Typing |:GLVS| will invoke getscript; it will
then use the <GetLatestVimScripts.dat> (see |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|) file to
get the latest versions of scripts listed therein from http://vim.sf.net/.

==============================================================================
2. GetLatestVimScripts -- Getting Started		*getscript-start*
						*getlatestvimscripts-install*

	VERSION FROM VIM DISTRIBUTION			*glvs-dist-install*

Vim 7.0 does not include the GetLatestVimScripts.dist file which
serves as an example and a template.  So, you'll need to create
your own!  See |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|.

	VERSION FROM VIM SF NET				*glvs-install*

NOTE: The last step, that of renaming/moving the GetLatestVimScripts.dist
file, is for those who have just downloaded GetLatestVimScripts.tar.bz2 for
the first time.

The GetLatestVimScripts.dist file serves as an example and a template for your
own personal list.  Feel free to remove all the scripts mentioned within it;
the "important" part of it is the first two lines.

Your computer needs to have wget or curl for GetLatestVimScripts to do its work.

	1. if compressed:  gunzip getscript.vba.gz
	2. Unix:
		vim getscript.vba
		:so %
		:q
		cd ~/.vim/GetLatest
		mv GetLatestVimScripts.dist GetLatestVimScripts.dat
		(edit GetLatestVimScripts.dat to install your own personal
		list of desired plugins -- see |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|)
	
	3. Windows:
		vim getscript.vba
		:so %
		:q
		cd **path-to-vimfiles**/GetLatest
		mv GetLatestVimScripts.dist GetLatestVimScripts.dat
		(edit GetLatestVimScripts.dat to install your own personal
		list of desired plugins -- see |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|)


==============================================================================
3. GetLatestVimScripts Usage				*glvs-usage* *:GLVS*

Unless it has been defined elsewhere, >

	:GLVS

will invoke GetLatestVimScripts().  If some other plugin has defined that
command, then you may type
>
	:GetLatestVimScripts
<
The script will attempt to update and, if permitted, will automatically
install scripts from http://vim.sourceforge.net/.  To do so it will peruse a
file,
>
	.vim/GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat                    (unix)
<
or >
	..wherever..\vimfiles\GetLatest\GetLatestVimScripts.dat   (windows)
(see |glvs-data|), and examine plugins in your [.vim|vimfiles]/plugin
directory (see |glvs-plugins|).

Scripts which have been downloaded will appear in the
~/.vim/GetLatest (unix) or ..wherever..\vimfiles\GetLatest (windows)
subdirectory.  GetLatestVimScripts will attempt to automatically
install them if you have the following line in your <.vimrc>: >

	let g:GetLatestVimScripts_allowautoinstall=1

The <GetLatestVimScripts.dat> file will be automatically be updated to
reflect the latest version of script(s) so downloaded.
(also see |glvs-options|)


==============================================================================
4. GetLatestVimScripts Data File		*getscript-data* *glvs-data*
 						*:GetLatestVimScripts_dat*
The data file <GetLatestVimScripts.dat> must have for its first two lines
the following text:
>
	ScriptID SourceID Filename
	--------------------------
<
Following those two lines are three columns; the first two are numeric
followed by a text column.  The GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dist file
contains an example of such a data file.  Anything following a #... is
ignored, so you may embed comments in the file.

The first number on each line gives the script's ScriptID.  When you're about
to use a web browser to look at scripts on http://vim.sf.net/, just before you
click on the script's link, you'll see a line resembling

	http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=40

The "40" happens to be a ScriptID that GetLatestVimScripts needs to
download the associated page, and is assigned by vim.sf.net itself
during initial uploading of the plugin.

The second number on each line gives the script's SourceID.  The SourceID
records the count of uploaded scripts as determined by vim.sf.net; hence it
serves to indicate "when" a script was uploaded.  Setting the SourceID to 1
insures that GetLatestVimScripts will assume that the script it has is
out-of-date.

The SourceID is extracted by GetLatestVimScripts from the script's page on
vim.sf.net; whenever it is greater than the one stored in the
GetLatestVimScripts.dat file, the script will be downloaded
(see |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|).

If your script's author has included a special comment line in his/her plugin,
the plugin itself will be used by GetLatestVimScripts to build your
<GetLatestVimScripts.dat> file, including any dependencies on other scripts it
may have.  As an example, consider: >

	" GetLatestVimScripts: 884  1 :AutoInstall: AutoAlign.vim

This comment line tells getscript.vim to check vimscript #884 and that the
script is automatically installable.  Getscript will also use this line to
help build the GetLatestVimScripts.dat file, by including a line such as: >

	884 1 :AutoInstall: AutoAlign.vim
<
assuming that such a line isn't already in GetLatestVimScripts.dat file.
See |glvs-plugins| for more.  Thus, GetLatestVimScripts thus provides a
comprehensive ability to keep your plugins up-to-date!

In summary:

  * Optionally tell getscript that it is allowed to build/append a
    GetLatestVimScripts.dat file based upon already installed plugins: >
	let g:GetLatestVimScripts_allowautoinstall=1
<
  * A line such as >
	" GetLatestVimScripts: 884  1 :AutoInstall: AutoAlign.vim
<   in an already-downloaded plugin constitutes the concurrence of the
    plugin author that getscript may do AutoInstall.  Not all plugins
    may be AutoInstall-able, and the plugin's author is best situated
    to know whether or not his/her plugin will AutoInstall properly.

  * A line such as >
	884 1 :AutoInstall: AutoAlign.vim
<   in your GetLatestVimScripts.dat file constitutes your permission
    to getscript to do AutoInstall.  AutoInstall requires both your
    and the plugin author's permission.  See |GetLatestVimScripts_dat|.


						*GetLatestVimScripts_dat*
As an example of a <GetLatestVimScripts.dat> file:
>
    ScriptID SourceID Filename
    --------------------------
    294 1 :AutoInstall: Align.vim
    120 2 Decho.vim
     40 3 DrawIt.tar.gz
    451 4 EasyAccents.vim
    195 5 engspchk.vim
    642 6 GetLatestVimScripts.vim
    489 7 Manpageview.vim
<
Note: the first two lines are required, but essentially act as comments.


==============================================================================
5. GetLatestVimScripts Friendly Plugins	*getscript-plugins* *glvs-plugins*

		(this section is for plugin authors)~

If a plugin author includes the following comment anywhere in their plugin,
GetLatestVimScripts will find it and use it to automatically build the user's
GetLatestVimScripts.dat files:
>
	                         src_id
	                            v
	" GetLatestVimScripts: ### ### yourscriptname
	                        ^
	                    scriptid
<
As an author, you should include such a line in to refer to your own script
plus any additional lines describing any plugin dependencies it may have.
Same format, of course!

If your command is auto-installable (see |glvs-autoinstall|), and most scripts
are, then you may include :AutoInstall: just before "yourscriptname":
>
	                         src_id
	                            v
	" GetLatestVimScripts: ### ### :AutoInstall: yourscriptname
	                        ^
	                    scriptid
<
NOTE: The :AutoInstall: feature requires both the plugin author's and~
      the user's permission to operate!~

GetLatestVimScripts commands for those scripts are then appended, if not
already present, to the user's GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat file.  It is
a relatively painless way to automate the acquisition of any scripts your
plugins depend upon.

Now, as an author, you probably don't want GetLatestVimScripts to download
your own scripts atop your own copy, thereby overwriting your not-yet-released
hard work.  GetLatestVimScripts provides a solution for this:  put
>
	0 0 yourscriptname
<
into your <GetLatestVimScripts.dat> file and GetLatestVimScripts will skip
examining the "yourscriptname" scripts for those GetLatestVimScripts comment
lines.  As a result, those lines won't be inadvertently installed into your
<GetLatestVimScripts.dat> file and subsequently used to download your own
scripts.  This is especially important to do if you've included the
:AutoInstall: option.

Be certain to use the same "yourscriptname" in the "0 0 yourscriptname" line
as you've used in your GetLatestVimScripts comment!


==============================================================================
6. GetLatestVimScripts AutoInstall			*getscript-autoinstall*
							*glvs-autoinstall*

GetLatestVimScripts now supports "AutoInstall".  Not all scripts are
supportive of auto-install, as they may have special things you need to do to
install them (please refer to the script's "install" directions).  On the
other hand, most scripts will be auto-installable.

To let GetLatestVimScripts do an autoinstall, the data file's comment field
should begin with (surrounding blanks are ignored): >

	:AutoInstall:
<
Both colons are needed, and it should begin the comment (yourscriptname)
field.

One may prevent any autoinstalling by putting the following line in your
<.vimrc>: >

	let g:GetLatestVimScripts_allowautoinstall= 0
<
With :AutoInstall: enabled, as it is by default, files which end with

	---.tar.bz2  : decompressed & untarred in .vim/ directory
	---.vba.bz2  : decompressed in .vim/ directory, then vimball handles it
	---.vim.bz2  : decompressed & moved into .vim/plugin directory
	---.tar.gz   : decompressed & untarred in .vim/ directory
	---.vba.gz   : decompressed in .vim/ directory, then vimball handles it
	---.vim.gz   : decompressed & moved into .vim/plugin directory
	---.vba      : unzipped in .vim/ directory
	---.vim      : moved to .vim/plugin directory
	---.zip      : unzipped in .vim/ directory

and which merely need to have their components placed by the untar/gunzip or
move-to-plugin-directory process should be auto-installable.  Vimballs, of
course, should always be auto-installable.

When is a script not auto-installable?  Let me give an example:

	.vim/after/syntax/blockhl.vim

The <blockhl.vim> script provides block highlighting for C/C++ programs; it is
available at:

	http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=104

Currently, vim's after/syntax only supports by-filetype scripts (in
blockhl.vim's case, that's after/syntax/c.vim).  Hence, auto-install would
possibly overwrite the current user's after/syntax/c.vim file.

In my own case, I use <aftersyntax.vim> (renamed to after/syntax/c.vim) to
allow a after/syntax/c/ directory:

	http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=1023

The script allows multiple syntax files to exist separately in the
after/syntax/c subdirectory.  I can't bundle aftersyntax.vim in and build an
appropriate tarball for auto-install because of the potential for the
after/syntax/c.vim contained in it to overwrite a user's c.vim.


==============================================================================
7. GetLatestVimScripts Options					*glvs-options*
>
	g:GetLatestVimScripts_wget
<	default= "wget"
		This variable holds the name of the command for obtaining
		scripts.
>
	g:GetLatestVimScripts_options
<	default= "-q -O"
		This variable holds the options to be used with the
		g:GetLatestVimScripts_wget command.
>
 	g:GetLatestVimScripts_allowautoinstall
<	default= 1
		This variable indicates whether GetLatestVimScripts is allowed
		to attempt to automatically install scripts.  Furthermore, the
		plugin author has to have explicitly indicated that his/her
		plugin is automatically installable (via the :AutoInstall:
		keyword in the GetLatestVimScripts comment line).
>
	g:GetLatestVimScripts_autoinstalldir
<	default= $HOME/.vim     (linux)
	default= $HOME/vimfiles (windows)
		Override where :AutoInstall: scripts will be installed.
		Doesn't override vimball installation.
>
	g:GetLatestVimScripts_scriptaddr
<       default='http://vim.sourceforge.net/script.php?script_id='
		Override this if your system needs
	  ...  ='http://vim.sourceforge.net/script/script.php?script_id='

==============================================================================
8. GetLatestVimScripts Algorithm		*glvs-algorithm* *glvs-alg*

The Vim sourceforge page dynamically creates a page by keying off of the
so-called script-id.  Within the webpage of

	http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=40

is a line specifying the latest source-id (src_id).  The source identifier
numbers are always increasing, hence if the src_id is greater than the one
recorded for the script in GetLatestVimScripts then it's time to download a
newer copy of that script.

GetLatestVimScripts will then download the script and update its internal
database of script ids, source ids, and scriptnames.

The AutoInstall process will:

	Move the file from GetLatest/ to the following directory
		Unix   : $HOME/.vim
		Windows: $HOME\vimfiles
	if the downloaded file ends with ".bz2"
		bunzip2 it
	else if the downloaded file ends with ".gz"
		gunzip it
	if the resulting file ends with ".zip"
		unzip it
	else if the resulting file ends with ".tar"
		tar -oxvf it
	else if the resulting file ends with ".vim"
		move it to the plugin subdirectory

9. GetLatestVimScripts History		*getscript-history* *glvs-hist* {{{1

v36 Apr 22, 2013 : * (glts) suggested use of plugin/**/*.vim instead of
		     plugin/*.vim in globpath() call.
		   * (Andy Wokula) got warning message when setting
		     g:loaded_getscriptPlugin
v35 Apr 07, 2012 : * (MengHuan Yu) pointed out that the script url has
		     changed (somewhat).  However, it doesn't work, and
		     the original one does (under Linux). I'll make it
		     yet-another-option.
v34 Jun 23, 2011 : * handles additional decompression options for tarballs
                     (tgz taz tbz txz)
v33 May 31, 2011 : * using fnameescape() instead of escape()
		   * *.xz support
v32 Jun 19, 2010 : * (Jan Steffens) added support for xz compression
v31 Jun 29, 2008 : * (Bill McCarthy) fixed having hls enabled with getscript
		   * (David Schaefer) the acd option interferes with vimballs
		     Solution: bypass the acd option
v30 Jun 13, 2008 : * GLVS now checks for existence of fnameescape() and will
		     issue an error message if it is not supported
v29 Jan 07, 2008 : * Bram M pointed out that cpo is a global option and that
                     getscriptPlugin.vim was setting it but not restoring it.
v28 Jan 02, 2008 : * improved shell quoting character handling, cygwin
		     interface, register-a bypass
    Oct 29, 2007   * Bill McCarthy suggested a change to getscript that avoids
                     creating pop-up windows
v24 Apr 16, 2007 : * removed save&restore of the fo option during script
                     loading
v23 Nov 03, 2006 : * ignores comments (#...)
                   * handles vimballs
v22 Oct 13, 2006 : * supports automatic use of curl if wget is not
                     available
v21 May 01, 2006 : * now takes advantage of autoloading.
v20 Dec 23, 2005 : * Eric Haarbauer found&fixed a bug with unzip use;
                     unzip needs the -o flag to overwrite.
v19 Nov 28, 2005 : * v18's GetLatestVimScript line accessed the wrong
                     script! Fixed.
v18 Mar 21, 2005 : * bugfix to automatic database construction
                   * bugfix - nowrapscan caused an error
                     (tnx to David Green for the fix)
    Apr 01, 2005   * if shell is bash, "mv" instead of "ren" used in
                     :AutoInstall:s, even though its o/s is windows
    Apr 01, 2005   * when downloading errors occurred, GLVS was
                     terminating early.  It now just goes on to trying
                     the next script (after trying three times to
                     download a script description page)
    Apr 20, 2005   * bugfix - when a failure to download occurred,
                     GetLatestVimScripts would stop early and claim that
                     everything was current.  Fixed.
v17 Aug 25, 2004 : * g:GetLatestVimScripts_allowautoinstall, which
                     defaults to 1, can be used to prevent all
                     :AutoInstall:
v16 Aug 25, 2004 : * made execution of bunzip2/gunzip/tar/zip silent
                   * fixed bug with :AutoInstall: use of helptags
v15 Aug 24, 2004 : * bugfix: the "0 0 comment" download prevention wasn't
                     always preventing downloads (just usually).  Fixed.
v14 Aug 24, 2004 : * bugfix -- helptags was using dotvim, rather than
                     s:dotvim.  Fixed.
v13 Aug 23, 2004 : * will skip downloading a file if its scriptid or srcid
                     is zero.  Useful for script authors; that way their
                     own GetLatestVimScripts activity won't overwrite
                     their scripts.
v12 Aug 23, 2004 : * bugfix - a "return" got left in the distribution that
                     was intended only for testing.  Removed, now works.
                   * :AutoInstall: implemented
v11 Aug 20, 2004 : * GetLatestVimScripts is now a plugin:
                   * :GetLatestVimScripts command
                   * (runtimepath)/GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat
                     now holds scripts that need updating
v10 Apr 19, 2004 : * moved history from script to doc
v9  Jan 23, 2004 :   windows (win32/win16/win95) will use
                     double quotes ("") whereas other systems will use
                     single quotes ('') around the urls in calls via wget
v8  Dec 01, 2003 :   makes three tries at downloading
v7  Sep 02, 2003 :   added error messages if "Click on..." or "src_id="
                     not found in downloaded webpage
                     Uses t_ti, t_te, and rs to make progress visible
v6  Aug 06, 2003 :   final status messages now display summary of work
                     ( "Downloaded someqty scripts" or
                       "Everything was current")
                     Now GetLatestVimScripts is careful about downloading
                     GetLatestVimScripts.vim itself!
                     (goes to <NEW_GetLatestVimScripts.vim>)
v5  Aug 04, 2003 :   missing an endif near bottom
v4  Jun 17, 2003 :   redraw! just before each "considering" message
v3  May 27, 2003 :   Protects downloaded files from errant shell
                     expansions with single quotes: '...'
v2  May 14, 2003 :   extracts name of item to be obtained from the
                     script file.  Uses it instead of comment field
                     for output filename; comment is used in the
                     "considering..." line and is now just a comment!
                   * Fixed a bug: a string-of-numbers is not the
                     same as a number, so I added zero to them
                     and they became numbers.  Fixes comparison.
