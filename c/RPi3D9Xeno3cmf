Description: extensible deep packet inspection library - ndpiReader
 nDPI is a ntop-maintained superset of the popular OpenDPI library. Released
 under the LGPL license, its goal is to extend the original library by adding
 new protocols that are otherwise available only on the paid version of
 OpenDPI.
 .
 nDPI has also been modified to be suitable for traffic monitoring
 applications, by disabling specific features that slow down the DPI engine
 while being them un-necessary for network traffic monitoring.
 .
 With nDPI, it is possible to both detect known protocols on non-standard ports
 (e.g. detect http non ports other than 80), and also the opposite.
 .
 This package contains the ndpiReader binary.

Description: extra libraries for needle
 Needle-Extras is an add-on library to Needle, providing additional services
 and functionality beyond what the core Needle system provides.
 .
 This is a kind of testbed of new services and techniques. If a service in
 Needle-Extras is found to be particularly valuable, it may be promoted into
 the core Needle framework.
 .
 Currently this includes a form of interface injection (thanks to Christian
 Neukirchen), a simplified means of depending on third-party services, and
 a general multicasting service.

 worry about the lower-level stuff.
 .
 Current features:
   * High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods (PUT, GET, HEAD, etc.)
   * Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing
     new methods easily.
   * persistent connections
   * RFC2617 basic and digest authentication (including auth-int, md5-sess)
   * Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication)
   * SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL (including client certificate and thread
     safety support)
   * Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism
   * XML parsing using the expat or libxml parsers
   * Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses
   * WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL.
   * WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties, query any set ofi
     properties (PROPPATCH/PROPFIND).
   * autoconf macros supplied for easily embedding neon directly inside an
     application source tree.

   * High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods (PUT, GET, HEAD, etc.)
   * Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing
     new methods easily.
   * persistent connections
   * RFC2617 basic and digest authentication (including auth-int, md5-sess)
   * Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication)
   * SSL/TLS support using GnuTLS (including client certificate and thread
     safety support)
   * Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism
   * XML parsing using the expat or libxml parsers
   * Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses
   * WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL.
   * WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties, query any set ofi
     properties (PROPPATCH/PROPFIND).
   * autoconf macros supplied for easily embedding neon directly inside an
     application source tree.

Description: Nepomuk Meta Data Library
 Nepomuk aims to provide the basis to handle all kinds of metadata on the KDE
 desktop in a generic fashion. This ranges from simple information such as tags
 or ratings over metadata extracted from files to metadata that is generated by
 applications automatically. RDF, the Resource Description Framework, provides
 the powerful basis to store and query all this data. The goal is to categorize
 all metadata using clean ontologies to make an automated handling and
 enrichment of the data possible.
 .
 This library implements core Nepomuk functionality like handling of resources
 and ontologies.

 developer blurb: "Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is
 designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon S3
 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and
 retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It
 gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable,
 fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run
 its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize
 benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers".
 .
 To find out more about S3, please visit: http://s3.amazonaws.com/

 of the protocol handling. The basic idea is that the application using

Description: Perl extension for the DBus bindings
 Net::DBus provides a Perl API for the DBus message system. The DBus Perl
 interface is currently operating against the 0.32 development version of
 DBus, but should work with later versions too, providing the API changes have
 not been too drastic.
 .
 Users of this package are either typically, service providers in which case
 the Net::DBus::Service and Net::DBus::Object modules are of most relevance,
 or are client consumers, in which case Net::DBus::RemoteService and
 Net::DBus::RemoteObject are of most relevance.

Description: Asynchronous DNS helper for high volume perl applications
 Net::DNS::Async is a fire-and-forget asynchronous DNS helper.
 That is, the user application adds DNS questions to the helper, and
 the callback will be called at some point in the future without
 further intervention from the user application. The application need
 not handle selects, timeouts, waiting for a response or any other
 such issues.
 .
 If the same query is added to the queue more than once, the module
 may combine the queries; that is, it will perform the query only
 once, and will call each callback registered for that query in turn,
 passing the same Net::DNS::Response object to each query. For this
 reason, you should not modify the Net::DNS::Response object in any
 way lest you break things horribly for a subsequent callback.
 .
 This module is similar in principle to POE::Component::Client::DNS, but
 does not require POE.

Description: library to determine DNS server vendor, product and version
 Identifying individual nameserver implementations is based on "borderline"
 protocol behaviour. The DNS protocol offers a multitude of message bits,
 response types, opcodes, classes, query types and label types in a fashion
 that makes some mutually exclusive while some are not used in a query
 messages at all.
 .
 Not every implementation offers the full set of features the DNS protocol
 set currently has. Some implementations offer features outside the protocol
 set, and there are implementations that do not conform to standards.
 .
 Amongst the servers it is able to identify are:
 .

Description: fast BIND-style zonefile parser on top of Net::DNS
 The Net::DNS::ZoneFile::Fast module provides an ability to parse zone files
 that BIND8 and BIND9 use, fast. Currently it provides a single function,
 parse(), which returns a reference to an array of traditional Net::DNS::RR
 objects, so that no new API has to be learned in order to manipulate zone
 records.
 .
 Great care was taken to ensure that parse() does its job as fast as possible,
 so it is interesting to use this module to parse huge zones. As an example
 datapoint, it takes less than 5 seconds to parse a 2.2 MB zone with about
 72000 records on an Athlon XP 2600+ box.

Description: module implementing the Extensible Provisioning Protocol
 Net::EPP is a collection of Perl modules that collectively implement the
 Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) as defined in RFC 4930. EPP is used
 for provisioning and management of objects stored in a shared repository.
 The protocol defines generic object management operations and an extensible
 framework that maps operations to objects.
 .
 Many Network Information Centres use EPP to provide services for provisioning
 of Internet domain names, hosts, and related contact details.

Description: module to make crafting network frames easier
 Net::Frame::Simple is part of Net::Frame frame crafting framework. It is
 totally optional, but can make playing with the network far easier.
 .
 Basically, it hides the complexity of frame forging, sending, and receiving,
 by providing helper methods, which will analyze internally how to assemble
 frames and find responses to probes.
 .
 For example, it will take care of computing lengths and checksums, and
 matching a response frame to the requesting frame.

Description: Perl extension for the Google Safe Browsing v2 API
 The library passes most of the unit tests listed in the API documentation. See
 the documentation
 (http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/developers_guide_v2.html) for more
 details about the failed tests.
 .
 The Google Safe Browsing database must be stored and managed locally.
 Net::Google::SafeBrowsing2::Sqlite uses Sqlite as the storage back-end,
 Net::Google::SafeBrowsing2::MySQL uses MySQL. Other storage mechanisms
 (databases, memory, etc.) can be added and used transparently with this module.
 .
 You may want to look at "Google Safe Browsing v2: Implementation Notes"
 (http://www.zscaler.com/research/Google%20Safe%20Browsing%20v2%20API.pdf), a
 collection of notes and real-world numbers about the API. This is intended for
 people who want to learn more about the API, whether as a user or to make their
 own implementation.
 .
 The source code is available on github at
 https://github.com/juliensobrier/Net-Google-SafeBrowsing2.
 .
 If you do not need to inspect more than 10,000 URLs a day, you can use
 Net::Google::SafeBrowsing2::Lookup with the Google Safe Browsing v2 Lookup API
 which does not require to store and maintain a local database.
 .
 IMPORTANT: If you start with an empty database, you will need to perform
 several updates to retrieve all the Google Safe Browsing information. This may
 require up to 24 hours. This is a limitation of the Google API, not of this
 module. See "Google Safe Browsing v2: Implementation Notes" at
 http://www.zscaler.com/research/Google%20Safe%20Browsing%20v2%20API.pdf.

Description: module providing low-level HTTP connection client
 The Net::HTTP class is a low-level HTTP client.  An instance of the
 Net::HTTP class represents a connection to an HTTP server.  The
 HTTP protocol is described in RFC 2616.  The Net::HTTP class
 supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. Net::HTTP is a sub-class of IO::Socket::INET.
 You can mix its methods with reading and writing from the socket directly.
 This is not necessarily a good idea, unless you know what you are doing.

 Both read and write access to network device attributes including the
 creation of new logical and physical interfaces is available where supported
 by the OS and this module.
 .
 NOTE: Many of the operations of Net::Interface, particularly those that set
 interface values require privileged access to OS resources. Wherever possible,
 Net::Interface will simply fail softly when there are not adequateprivileges
 to perform the requested operation or where the operation is not supported.

Description: perl interface to the Internet Route Registry daemon
 Net::IRR provides an object oriented perl interface to the Internet Route
 Registry. The interface uses the RIPE/RPSL Tool Query Language as defined in
 Appendix B of the IRRd User Guide. The guide can be found at
 http://www.irrd.net/, however an understanding of the query language is not
 required to use this module.
 .
 Net::IRR supports IRRd's multiple-command mode. Multiple-command mode is good
 for intensive queries since only one TCP connection needs to be made for
 multiple queries. The interface also allows for additional queries that
 aren't supported by standard UNIX whois utitilies.

Description: automated Bot creation with safeties
 This Perl module, Net::Jabber::Bot, provides tools for writing a Jabber
 Bot.
 .
 The idea behind the module is that someone creating a bot should not
 really have to know a whole lot about how the Jabber protocol works in
 order to use it. It also allows us to abstract away all the things
 that can get a bot maker into trouble. Essentially the object helps
 protect the coders from their own mistakes.

Description: module to look up the vendor by OUI
 The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) assigns an
 Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI) to manufacturers of network
 interfaces. Each interface has a Media Access Control (MAC) address of six
 bytes. The first three bytes are the OUI.
 .
 Net::MAC::Vendor allows you to take a MAC address and turn it into the OUI
 and vendor information. You can, for instance, scan a network, collect MAC
 addresses, and turn those addresses into vendors. With vendor information,
 you can often guess at what you are looking at (e.g. an Apple product).
 .
 You can use this as a module as its individual functions, or call it as a
 script with a list of MAC addresses as arguments. The module can figure it
 out.

 Net::NTP is a small perl module to query an NTP (Network Time Protocol)

 RFC2030.  The response from the server is "humanized" to a point that further
 processing of the information received from the server can be manipulated.
 For example: timestamps are in epoch, so one could use the localtime function
 to produce an even more "human" representation of the timestamp.

Description: Perl SSH client package implemented on top of OpenSSH
 Net::OpenSSH is a secure shell client package implemented on top of the
 OpenSSH binary client (ssh), leveraging the multiplexing feature found
 in current versions of OpenSSH. That is, when a new Net::OpenSSH object
 is created, ssh is run in master mode establishing a permanent
 connection. Then, every time a new operation is requested, a new ssh
 process is started in slave mode, reusing the master SSH
 connection to send the request to the remote side. This makes
 Net::OpenSSH very fast, as most of the latency of ssh is intrinsic to
 the protocol.
 .
 If you like the API of other Perl SSH distributions like Net::SSH,
 Net::SSH2 or Net::SSH::Perl, and would like to use them with
 Net::OpenSSH, have a look at the libnet-openssh-compat-perl package.

Description: Perl module for fast IP address lookups
 Net::Patricia uses a Patricia Trie data structure to quickly
 perform IP address prefix matching for applications such as
 IP subnet, network or routing table lookups.  The data
 structure is based on a radix tree using a radix of two, so
 sometimes you see patricia implementations called "radix" as
 well.  The term "Trie" is derived from the word "retrieval"
 but is pronounced like "try".  Patricia stands for
 "Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded as
 Alphanumeric", and was first suggested for routing table
 lookups by Van Jacobsen.  Patricia Trie performance
 characteristics are well-known as it has been employed for
 routing table lookups within the BSD kernel since the 4.3
 Reno release.

Description: Framework for proxying network connections in many ways
 This module is a framework for creating various kinds of network
 proxies in a very simple way.
 .
 A proxy is a program that transfer data across a network boundary between
 a client and a server. Net::Proxy introduces the concept of "connectors",
 which abstract the server part (connected to the client) and the client
 part (connected to the server) of the proxy.
 .
 This makes it very easy to implement specific techniques to cross a
 given network boundary, possibly by using a proxy on one side of the
 network fence, and a reverse-proxy on the other side of the fence.
 .
 This package also provides the sslh SSH/HTTPS service multiplexer
 written in perl.

 An RBL, or Realtime Blackhole List, is a list of IP addresses meeting some
 criteria such as involvement in Unsolicited Bulk Email.  Each RBL has
 its own criteria for addition and removal of addresses.  If you want to

 RBLs, you should carefully study the behavior of those RBLs before and
 during such blocking.

 server may be mapped to any command name.  Each command is also
 associated with an ACL containing a list of Kerberos principals
 authorized to run that command.

 This package contains the Net::Remctl Perl library, which provides native
 Perl bindings for the libremctl client library.  It also contains the
 Net::Remctl::Backend module, which assists in writing remctl backends in
 Perl.

Description: Secure File Transfer Protocol Server
 Net::SFTP::SftpServer is a Perl port of sftp-server from OpenSSH
 providing access control on a per user and per command basis with
 improved logging via syslog.
 .
 This version of the Net::SFTP::SftpServer Perl module currently
 implements SSH File Transfer Protocol version 3.
 .
 The limitations compared with the OpenSSH implementation are as follows:
 .
   - Only files and directories are dealt with - other inode types are not
     returned on readdir.
   - A virtual chroot is performed - / (rootfs) is treated as the users home
     directory from the client perspective and all file access to / will
     be in /<home_path>/<username>. The <home_path> is defined on object
     initialisation, it is not obtained from /etc/passwd.
   - All symlinked files or directories can be hidden and made inaccessible on
     request. Symlink returns "permission denied" then, readlink returns "file
     does not exist".
   - Setting of stats (set_stat or set_fstat) is disabled - the client will
     receive permission denied.
   - Permissions for files and dirs are defaulted - the defaults are set on
     object initialisation.

Description: native Perl SMTP Server implementation for Perl
 The Net::SMTP::Server module implements an RFC 821 compliant SMTP
 server, completely in Perl.  It's extremely extensible, so adding in
 things like spam filtering, or more advanced routing and handling
 features can be easily handled.  An additional module,
 Net::SMTP::Server::Relay has also been implemented as an example of
 just one application of this extensibility.  See the pod for more
 details on that module.  This extension has been tested on both Unix
 and Win32 platforms.
 .
 Creating a new server is as trivial as:
 .
 $server = new Net::SMTP::Server($host, $port);
 .
 This creates a new SMTP::Server.  Both $host and $port are optional,
 and default to the current hostname and the standard SMTP port (25).
 However, if you run on a multi-homed machine, you may want to
 explicitly specify which interface to bind to.

Description: Perl module providing SSL support to Net::SMTP
 Net::SMTP::SSL implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL
 for its network operations. Due to the nature of Net::SMTP's new method, it is
 not overridden to make use of a default port for the SMTPS service. Perhaps
 future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually what you want,
 and it's not a pain to specify that.
 .
 This package is deprecated. Net::SMTP (in perl core) has support for SMTP
 over SSL, and also for STARTTLS, since version 1.28 (included in Perl 5.22).

Description: Perl module for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
 Net::SSLeay is a perl module that allows you to call Secure Sockets Layer
 (SSL) functions of the SSLeay library directly from your perl scripts. It
 is useful if you want to program robots that access secure web servers or
 if you want to build your own applications over SSL encrypted tunnels. If
 you just want to view web pages on https servers, you do not need this -
 your web browser already knows to do that.

Description: module to add/extend SSL support for common perl modules
 Some commonly used perl modules don't have SSL support at all, even if the
 protocol would support it. Others have SSL support, but most of them don't do
 proper checking of the servers certificate.
 .
 The Net::SSLGlue::* modules try to add SSL support or proper certificate to
 these modules.

 Simple I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are provided.
 More sophisticated interactive features are provided because
 connecting to a TELNET port ultimately means communicating with a

 include the ability to specify a timeout and to wait for patterns to
 appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a shell.

Description: Perl module implementing a simple VNC client
 Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a desktop sharing system which uses the
 RFB (Remote FrameBuffer) protocol to remotely control another computer.
 Net::VNC acts as a VNC client and communicates to a VNC server using the RFB
 protocol, allowing you to capture the screen of the remote computer.
 .
 This module dies upon connection errors (with a timeout of 15 seconds) and
 protocol errors.
 .
 This implementation is based largely on the RFB Protocol Specification,
 http://www.realvnc.com/docs/rfbproto.pdf. That document has an error in the
 DES encryption description, which is clarified via
 http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/junk/vnc.html.

 One of the more important goals of this module is to enable the
 design of consistent and predictable interfaces to incompatible
 whois response formats. The Whois RFC (954) does not define a
 template for presenting server data; consequently there is a large
 variation in layout styles as well as content served across
 servers.

Description: gateway between Z39.50 and SRU/SRW
 The Net::Z3950::Simple2ZOOM module provides all the application logic of a
 generic "Swiss Army Gateway" between Z39.50 and SRU. It is used by the
 simple2zoom program, and there is probably no good reason to make any other
 program to use it. For that reason, this library-level documentation is more
 than usually terse.
 .
 The library has only two public entry points: the new() constructor and the
 launch_server() method. The synopsis above shows how they are used: a
 Simple2ZOOM object is created using new(), then the launch_server() method is
 invoked on it to -- get ready for a big surprise here -- launch the server.
 (In fact, this synopsis is essentially the whole of the code of the
 simple2zoom program. All the work happens inside the library.)

Description: simple perl API for building Z39.50 servers
 The Net::Z3950::SimpleServer module is a tool for constructing Z39.50
 "Information Retrieval" servers in Perl. The module is easy to use, but it does
 help to have an understanding of the Z39.50 query structure and the
 construction of structured retrieval records.
 .
 Z39.50 is a network protocol for searching remote databases and
 retrieving the results in the form of structured "records". It is widely
 used in libraries around the world, as well as in the US Federal Government.
 In addition, it is generally useful whenever you wish to integrate a number
 of different database systems around a shared, asbtract data model.
 .
 The model of the module is simple: It implements a "generic" Z39.50
 server, which invokes callback functions supplied by you to search
 for content in your database. You can use any tools available in
 Perl to supply the content, including modules like DBI and
 WWW::Search.
 .
 The server will take care of managing the network connections for
 you, and it will spawn a new process (or thread, in some
 environments) whenever a new connection is received.

Description: Perl extension implementing the ZOOM API for Information Retrieval via Z39.50
 Net::Z3950::ZOOM provides a nice, Perlish implementation of the ZOOM
 Abstract API described and documented at http://zoom.z3950.org/api/
 .
 The ZOOM module is implemented as a set of thin classes on top of the
 non-OO functions provided by this distribution's Net::Z3950::ZOOM module,
 which in turn is a thin layer on top of the ZOOM-C code supplied as part of
 Index Data's YAZ Toolkit.  Because ZOOM-C is also the underlying code that
 implements ZOOM bindings in C++, Visual Basic, Scheme, Ruby, .NET
 (including C#) and other languages, this Perl module works compatibly with
 those other implementations.  (Of course, the point of a public API such as
 ZOOM is that all implementations should be compatible anyway; but knowing
 that the same code is running is reassuring.)

Description: Perl modules for managing NetApp's NAS devices
 NetApp provides a suite of modules for managing NetApp's NAS devices,
 commonly referred to as "filers".
 .
 Both SSH and telnet are supported, but only SSH is really recommended. NetApp
 doesn't support concurrent access via telnet, and the error checking using
 SSH is far more robust. Not to mention, you can configure secure access via
 SSH without using passwords, but telnet access will always require a
 password.

Description: OCaml application-level Internet libraries - HTTP daemon development libraries
 Ocamlnet is a collection of OCaml libraries focusing focus on
 application-level Internet protocols and conventions.
 .
 Ocamlnet consists of the following libraries:
  * netstring: processing of strings that occur in network context
  * netcgi2: portable web applications
  * nethttpd: is a web server component (HTTP server implementation)
  * netplex: generic server framework
  * rpc: OncRPC implementation
  * netclient: clients for HTTP, FTP, and Telnet
  * equeue: event queue used for many protocol implementations
  * shell: external commands invocation
  * netshm: shared memory for IPC purposes
  * netsys: bindings for system functions
  * smtp and pop: two further client implementations
 .
 A number of ideas and concepts are used throughout the libraries:
  * netchannels are a way to abstract sequential I/O channels
  * event queues provided by equeue and unixqueue make asynchronous
    protocol interpreters possible
 .
 This package contains the development stuff you need to use the
 nethttpd library in your programs.

Description: modules to manipulate network packets at the protocol level
 NetPacket provides a base class for a cluster of modules related to
 decoding and encoding of network protocols.  Each NetPacket
 descendent module knows how to encode and decode packets for the
 network protocol it implements.  Consult the documentation for the
 module in question for protocol-specific implementation.
 .
 Note that there is no inheritance in the NetPacket:: cluster of
 modules other than each protocol module being a NetPacket.  This
 was seen to be too restrictive as imposing inheritance relationships
 (for example between the IP, UDP and TCP protocols) would make things
 like tunneling or other unusual situations difficult.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

Description: Not Erik's Windowing Toolkit - text mode windowing with slang
 Newt is a windowing toolkit for text mode built from the slang library.
 It allows color text mode applications to easily use stackable windows,
 push buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, lists, entry fields, labels,
 and displayable text. Scrollbars are supported, and forms may be nested
 to provide extra functionality. This package contains the shared library
 for programs that have been built with newt.

Description: high-performance JSON framework for .NET -- development files
 Json.NET is a high-performance JSON framework for .NET. It has the following
 features:
  - Flexible JSON serializer for converting between .NET objects and JSON
  - LINQ to JSON for manually reading and writing JSON
  - High performance, faster than .NET's build-in JSON serializers
  - Write indented, easy to read JSON
  - Convert JSON to and from XML
 .
 The JSON serializer is a good choice when the JSN being read or written maps
 closely to a .NET class.
 .
 LINQ to JSON is good for situations in which there is no class to serialize or
 deserialize to, or the JSON is radically different from the class structure and
 manual manipulation is required.
 .
 This package contains the development files required to compile applications or
 libraries against this package.

Description: library for computing non-uniform Fourier transforms (double precision)
 NFFT3 is a software library written in C for computing nonequispaced fast
 Fourier and related transformations. In detail, NFFT3 implements:
 .
 1) The nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT)
    - the forward transform (NFFT)
    - the adjoint transform (adjoint NFFT)
 .
 2) Generalisations of the NFFT
    - to arbitrary knots in time and frequency domain (NNFFT)
    - to the sphere S^2 (NFSFT)
    - to the hyperbolic cross (NSFFT)
    - to real-valued data, i.e. (co)sine transforms, (NFCT, NFST)
    - to the rotation group (NFSOFT)
 .
 3) Generalised inverses based on iterative methods, e.g. CGNR, CGNE
 .
 4) Applications in
    - medical imaging
         (i) magnetic resonance imaging
        (ii) computerised tomography
    - summation schemes
          (i) fast Gauss transform (FGT)
         (ii) singular kernels
        (iii) zonal kernels
    - polar FFT, discrete Radon transform, ridgelet transform
 .
 This package provides the shared library compiled with double precision.

Description: Bring echo and more shell style goodies to Nginx
 Echo module wraps lots of Nginx internal APIs for streaming input and output,
 parallel/sequential subrequests, timers and sleeping, as well as various meta
 data accessing.
 .
 Basically it provides various utilities that help testing and debugging of
 other modules by trivially emulating different kinds of faked subrequest
 locations.
 .
 People will also find it useful in real-world applications that need to:
 .
 1. Serve static contents directly from memory.
 2. Wrap the upstream response with custom header and footer (kinda like the
    addition module but with contents read directly from the config file and
    Nginx variables).
 3. Merge contents of various "Nginx locations" (i.e., subrequests) together in
    a single main request (using echo_location and its friends).

Description: Fast streaming JSON parser for Java
 Noggit is the world's fastest streaming JSON parser for Java.
 Features:
  * Fast! Measured as the fastest JSON parser on char[], String input.
  * Streaming API (StAX/pull-parser like) for both easy and efficient parsing
  * Conforms to the JSON standard: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt
  * Memory efficiency
     * incremental parsing (Reader-based) in order to handle huge messages
     * a single byte of state needed per nested object or array
     * does not read large objects (including primitives) completely
       into memory unless asked
     * can eliminate most copying, allowing the user to provide
       the output buffer for values
  * can handle primitives of any size (does not attempt to parse
    numerics into a certain language primitives unless asked)
  * Simple serialization of objects (List, Map, etc)
  * Optional creation of objects (List, Map, etc) when parsing.

 many different formats of PKCS8 and OpenSSL Encrypted Private Keys,
 and it automatically detects the type of KeyMaterial or
 TrustMaterial.
 .
 It's called "Not-Yet-Commons-SSL" because of the intention of one day
 making it an official Apache project. It currently has no affiliation
 with the Apache Software Foundation.

Description: Documentation for Not-yet-commons-SSL
 Not-yet-commons-SSL implements SSL functionality in a way that is
 easy and flexible. It improves security by checking CRLs by
 default. It allows options to be set or unset for each
 SSLSocketFactory. It supports many different formats of PKCS8 and
 OpenSSL Encrypted Private Keys, and it automatically detects the type
 of KeyMaterial or TrustMaterial.
 .
 It's called "Not-Yet-Commons-SSL" because of the intention of one day
 making it an official Apache project. It currently has no affiliation
 with the Apache Software Foundation.
 .
 This package contains the API documentation of
 libnot-yet-commons-ssl-java.

 nPth is a non-preemptive threads implementation using an API very
 similar to the one known from GNU Pth. It has been designed as a
 replacement of GNU Pth for non-ancient operating systems. In
 contrast to GNU Pth it is based on the system's standard threads
 implementation. Thus nPth allows the use of libraries which are not
 compatible to GNU Pth.
 .
 This is a Windows version of nPth.  It's meant to be used when
 cross-building software that targets the Windows platform, e.g. the
 win32-loader component of Debian-Installer.

Description: nss module providing fallback resolution for the current hostname
 This package contains a plugin for the Name Service Switch, providing host
 name resolution for the locally configured system hostname as returned by
 gethostname(2). It returns all locally configured public IP addresses or -- if
 none are configured, the IPv4 address 127.0.1.1 (which is on the local
 loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local host).
 .
 A lot of software relies on that the local host name is resolvable. This
 package provides an alternative to the fragile and error-prone manual editing
 of /etc/hosts.
 .
 Installing this package automatically adds myhostname to /etc/nsswitch.conf.

Description: NSS module for using MySQL as a naming service
 libnss-mysql-bg provides a Name Service Switch module that allows MySQL
 to act as a name service.
 .
 Its configuration is very flexible by allowing to set an SQL query per NSS
 call (getpwnam, getpwuid, ...). You would use it instead of the other
 "libnss-mysql" package for building an NSS over an existing database (used for
 another purpose like groupware, ...).
 .
 It currently supports storage of passwd, group and shadow information.

Description: NSS module for using PostgreSQL as a naming service
 This module works as a replacement for the flat file databases /etc/passwd,
 /etc/group etc. It is a plugin to glibc's name service switch.
 .
 The module uses tables in a PostgreSQL database to store user, group, and
 shadow information. The module can be configured to use custom queries to
 retrieve it's information from a database. The module allows one to separate
 the configuration for shadow information from group and user information to
 restrict access to shadow information to privileged users (i.e. root or the
 shadow group).

Description: NSS wrapper library
 There are projects which provide daemons needing to be able to create, modify
 and delete unix users. Or just switch user ids to interact with the system,
 for example a user space file server. To be able to test that you need the
 privilege to modify the passwd and groups file. With nss_wrapper it is
 possible to define your own passwd and groups file which will be used by
 software to act correctly while under test.
 .
 If you have a client and server under test they normally use functions to
 resolve network names to addresses (DNS) or vice versa. The nss_wrappers allow
 you to create a hosts file to setup name resolution for the addresses you use
 with socket_wrapper.

Description: New Trivial Database - development files
 This is a simple database API. It is modelled after the structure
 of GDBM. TDB features, unlike GDBM, multiple writers support with
 appropriate locking and transactions.
 .
 ntdb uses a file format that is incompatible with tdb, but the API
 is similar. It improves performance, adds support for databases
 larger than 4 Gb, and improves integration with talloc.
 .
 This package contains the development files.

  * Bi-directional operation.
  * Full-duplex operation on the TCP (vc) transport.
  * Thread-safe operating modes:
    * new locking primitives and lock callouts (interface change).
    * stateless send/recv on the TCP transport (interface change).
  * Flexible server integration support.
  * Event channels.

Description: NTLM authentication library
 NTLM is an authentication protocol used in various Microsoft network
 protocol implementations and supported by the NTLM Security Support
 Provider ("NTLMSSP"). Originally used for authentication and negotiation
 of secure DCE/RPC, NTLM is also used throughout Microsoft's systems as
 an integrated single sign-on mechanism.
 .
 NTLM employs a challenge-response mechanism for authentication, in  which
 clients are able to prove their identities without sending a  password to
 the server. It consists of three messages, commonly referred  to as Type 1
 (negotiation), Type 2 (challenge) and Type 3 (authentication).

Description: module to convert byte count to human readable format and back
 Number::Bytes::Human provides a formatter which turns byte counts to
 usual readable format, like '2.0K' or '3.1GiB', as well as a parser to
 go the opposite way. It was inspired by the -h option of Unix utilities
 like du and df for "human-readable" output.

Description: authenticating firewall [SSL library]
 NuFW is an authenticating firewall based on netfilter's NFQUEUE target.
 It allows one to write filtering rules based on user identity, in addition
 to classical network criteria. Unless other solutions, NuFW uses a
 strict security model and can apply different access rules to users
 connected on the same host, for example.
 .
 This library provides an abstraction layer over SSL functions.

Description: utility library for talking to the LEGO Mindstorms NXT brick
 LibNXT is an utility library for talking to the LEGO Mindstorms NXT intelligent
 brick at a relatively low level. It currently does:
  * Handling USB communication and locating the NXT in the USB tree.
  * Interaction with the Atmel AT91SAM boot assistant.
  * Flashing of a firmware image to the NXT.
  * Execution of code directly in RAM.
 .
 The design of LibNXT is layered, meaning you can plug into it at any level of
 complexityor abstraction you desire, from the lowest level USB bulk bit-pushing
 interface, to an API exposing the SAM-BA commandset, right up to just calling
 nxt_firmware_flash() and having everything taken care of!
 .
 This package provides two binary utils:
  * fwflash is the program that uses LibNXT. As its name hints, its purpose is
    to take a NXT firmware image file and flash it to a connected NXT device.
  * fwexec is another utility, which takes a specially compiled firmware image,
   uploads it to the NXT's RAM, and executes it directly from there.

Description: Build-system generation for OCaml projects -- runtime
 OASIS generates a full configure, build and install system for your
 application. It starts with a simple `_oasis` file at the toplevel of your
 project and creates everything required.
 .
 It uses external tools like OCamlbuild and it can be considered as the glue
 between various subsystems that do the job. It should support the following
 tools:
 .
  - OCamlbuild
  - OMake (todo)
  - OCamlMakefile (todo),
  - ocaml-autoconf (todo)
 .
 It also features a do-it-yourself command line invocation and an internal
 configure/install scheme. Libraries are managed through findlib. It has been
 tested on GNU Linux and Windows.
 .
 OASIS supports standard entry points and descriptions. It helps to
 integrates your libraries and software with third parties tools like GODI.
 .
 This package contains the shared runtime libraries and plugins.

Description: interface to create per object accessors
 Object::Accessor provides an interface to create per object accessors (as
 opposed to per Class accessors, as, for example, Class::Accessor provides).
 .
 You can choose to either subclass this module, and thus using its accessors
 on your own module, or to store an Object::Accessor object inside your own
 object, and access the accessors from there.

Description: Perl module to add an AUTHORITY method to your class
 Object::AUTHORITY adds an AUTHORITY function to your package, which
 works along the same lines as the VERSION function. The authority it
 takes as an argument should be a URI identifying the person, team,
 organisation or trained chimp responsible for the release of the
 package. The pseudo-URI scheme cpan: is the most commonly used
 identifier.

Description: module that provides a simple object container
 Object::Container is an object container with an OO interface. It is
 used to make singletons out of ordinary classes.
 .
 For example, if you want to have a single instance of WWW::Mechanize
 throughout a program, you can do
 Object::Container->register('WWW::Mechanize') somewhere and then you
 can retrieve that instance of WWW::Mechanize from anywhere else with
 Object::Container->get('WWW::Mechanize');
 .
 Class::Singleton is a similar module, which makes subclasses
 singletons. Unlike Class::Singleton, Object::Container can make any
 class a singleton.
 .
 Object::Registrar is another similar module, but it does not support
 lazy loading.

Description: declarative object constructor
 Object::Declare exports one function, declare, for building named
 objects with a declarative syntax, similar to how Jifty::DBI::Schema
 defines its columns.
 .
 In list context, declare returns a list of name/object pairs in the
 order of declaration (allowing duplicates), suitable for putting into a hash.
 In scalar context, declare returns a hash reference.
 .
 Example: function for defining some declarative object
 .
  sub do_declare { declare {
      column x =>
          is rw,
          is Very::Happy;
      } };

Description: make objects with circular references DESTROY normally
 Object::Destroyer allows for the creation of "Destroy" handles. The
 handle is "attached" to a circular relationship, but is not a part of
 it. When the destroy handle falls out of scope, it will be cleaned up
 correctly, and while being cleaned up, it will also force the data
 structure it is attached to to be destroyed as well. Object::Destroyer
 can call a specified release method on an object (or method DESTROY by
 default). Alternatively, it can execute an arbitrary user code passed to
 constructor as a code reference.

Description: comprehensive inside-out object construction kit
 Object::InsideOut is a Perl module that implements inside-out objects as
 anonymous scalar references that are blessed into a class with the scalar
 containing the ID for the object (usually a sequence number). The scalar
 reference is set as read-only to prevent accidental modifications to the ID.
 Object data (such as fields) are stored within the class's package in either
 arrays indexed by the object's ID, or hashes keyed to the object's ID.

Description: Perl module providing delayed creation of objects
 The Object::Realize::Later class helps with implementing transparent

 on autoloading of data, the lesser known cousin of autoloading of
 functionality.
 .
 On demand realization is all about performance gain.  Why should you
 spent costly time on realizing an object, when the data on the object is
 never (or not yet) used?  In interactive programs, postponed realization
 may boost start-up: the realization of objects is triggered by the
 use, so spread over time.

 and tracking which packages have consumed your role.

 not export anything. Instead, your role must inherit from it.

Description: rendering library for openbox themes
 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly. Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
 .
 This package contains the libobrender library files used by openbox
 for theme rendering.

 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly. Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
 .
 This package contains the libobt library files used by openbox
 to load and parse configuration and theme files of openbox.

Description: graph library for OCaml
 Ocamlgraph is a graph library for OCaml. Its contribution is
 three-fold:
 .
  * It provides an easy-to-use graph data structure together with
    several operations and algorithms over graphs.  It is a
    reasonably efficient imperative data structure for directed
    graphs with vertices and edges labeled with integers.
 .
  * Then ocamlgraph provides several other graph implementations
    for those not satisfied with the one above. Some are
    persistent (imutable) and other imperative (mutable). Some
    are directed and other are not. Some have labels for
    vertices, or labels for edges, or both. Some have abstract
    types for vertices. etc.
    These implementations are written as functors: you give the
    types of vertices labels, edge labels, etc. and you get the
    data structure as a result.
 .
  * Finally, ocamlgraph provides several classic operations and
    algorithms over graphs.
    They are also written as functors i.e. independently of the
    data structure for graphs. One consequence is that you can
    define your own data structure for graphs and yet re-use all
    the algorithms from this library -- you only need to provide
    a few operations such as iterating over all vertices, over
    the successors of a vertex, etc.

Description: OCaml application-level Internet libraries - SSL runtime libraries
 Ocamlnet is a collection of OCaml libraries focusing focus on
 application-level Internet protocols and conventions.
 .
 Ocamlnet consists of the following libraries:
  * netstring: processing of strings that occur in network context
  * netcgi2: portable web applications
  * nethttpd: is a web server component (HTTP server implementation)
  * netplex: generic server framework
  * rpc: OncRPC implementation
  * netclient: clients for HTTP, FTP, and Telnet
  * equeue: event queue used for many protocol implementations
  * shell: external commands invocation
  * netshm: shared memory for IPC purposes
  * netsys: bindings for system functions
  * smtp and pop: two further client implementations
 .
 A number of ideas and concepts are used throughout the libraries:
  * netchannels are a way to abstract sequential I/O channels
  * event queues provided by equeue and unixqueue make asynchronous
    protocol interpreters possible
 .
 This package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries for the
 SSL-related libraries of Ocamlnet.

Description: pure Perl interface to Ogg Vorbis information fields
 Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl is an object-oriented interface to Ogg Vorbis
 information and comment fields, implemented entirely in Perl. Intended to be a
 drop in replacement for Ogg::Vobis::Header.
 .
 Unlike Ogg::Vorbis::Header, this module will go ahead and fill in all of the
 information fields as soon as you construct the object. In other words, the new
 and load constructors have identical behavior.

    to raw Ogg files.
  * A customisable seeking abstraction for seeking on multitrack Ogg data.
  * A packet queue for feeding incoming packets for writing, with callback
    based notification when this queue is empty.
  * A handy table structure for storing information on each logical
    bitstream.

Description: Perl binding for the OGRE C++ graphics library
 This is a Perl binding for OGRE, Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine,
 a C++ library found at http://www.ogre3d.org/ .
 .
 The wrapping is currently incomplete, but there are several interesting
 examples working now (see examples/README.txt).
 .
 For documentation on specific classes, see the perldoc for the class. The
 documentation for each class is somewhat minimal. In the DESCRIPTION section
 there will be a link to the corresponding C++ API documentation on the OGRE
 website. The documentation of methods uses C++ types to describe its
 parameters and return values, so some translation to Perl is generally
 required.

Description: Library of Optimized Inner Loops
 Liboil is a collection of functions that often benefit from having
 special implementations on various architectures or CPUs.  Each function
 in liboil has several implementations which may perform faster or
 slower on a given CPU.  Some implementations use alternate algorithms,
 some use hand-crafted assembly, and some use special instructions that
 are only available on certain CPUs, such as MMX, SSE, or Altivec.
 The fastest implementation is automatically chosen at runtime.
 .
 This package contains the liboil shared libraries.  It is typically
 installed automatically when an application or library requires it.

 applications which may respond to events from several sources. It
 replaces the "select() loop" and allows the registration of event
 handlers for file and network I/O, timers and signals. Since processes
 use these mechanisms for almost all external communication, liboop can
 be used as a basis for almost any application.

Description: Event loop management library
 Liboop is a low-level event loop management library for POSIX-based
 operating systems. It supports the development of modular, multiplexed
 applications which may respond to events from several sources. It
 replaces the "select() loop" and allows the registration of event
 handlers for file and network I/O, timers and signals. Since processes
 use these mechanisms for almost all external communication, liboop can
 be used as a basis for almost any application.

 vendor-neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily spatialized
 audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop
 users that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other
 multimedia applications.
 .
 This library is meant as a compatible update/replacement to the OpenAL Sample
 Implementation (the SI). The SI has been unmaintained for quite a while, and
 would require a lot of work to clean up. This is a fork the old Windows version
 to attempt an accelerated ALSA version of an OpenAL implementation.
 .
 OpenAL Soft supports mono, stereo, 4-channel, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 output, as
 opposed to the SI's 4-channel max (though it did have some provisions for 6
 channel, this was not 5.1, and was seemingly a "late" addition). OpenAL Soft
 does not support the Vorbis and MP3 extensions, however those were considered
 deprecated even in the SI. It does, though, support some of the newer
 extensions like AL_EXT_FLOAT32 and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS for multi-channel and
 floating-point formats, as well as ALC_EXT_EFX for environmental audio effects,
 and others.
 .

Description: opencsv - Library for reading and writing CSV in Java
 Opencsv is a very simple csv (comma-separated values) parser library for Java.
 It supports all the basic csv-type things you're likely to want to do:
 .
  * Arbitrary numbers of values per line
  * Ignoring commas in quoted elements
  * Handling quoted entries with embedded carriage returns
    (ie entries that span multiple lines)
  * Configurable separator and quote characters (or use sensible defaults)
  * Read all the entries at once, or use an Iterator style model
  * Creating csv files from String[] (ie. automatic escaping of embedded
    quote chars)

Description: development files for the OpenEXR image library
 OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
 Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
 .
 OpenEXR's features include:
    * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and
      10-bit image file formats.
    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the
      included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on
      images with film grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
      be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
      software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
      integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
      affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
      applications.
 .
 This package contains the header files required if you wish to
 compile/develop applications that use OpenEXR libraries.

Description: This library allows you to OpenID-enable your Java webapp
 OpenID starts with the concept that anyone can identify themselves on the
 Internet the same way websites do - with a URI. Since URIs are at the very core
 of Web architecture, they provide a solid foundation for user-centric identity.
 The first piece of the OpenID framework is authentication -- how you prove
 ownership of a URI. Today, websites require usernames and passwords to login,
 which means that many people use the same password everywhere. With OpenID
 Authentication, your username is your URI, and your password (or other
 credentials) stays safely stored on your OpenID Provider (which you can run
 yourself, or use a third-party identity provider).
 .
 The library provided by this package supports the following specifications:
  - OpenID Authentication 2.0
  - OpenID Authentication 1.1 (in compatibility mode)
  - OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0
  - OpenID Simple Registration 1.0 and 1.1, draft 1
  - OpenID Provider Authentication Policy Extension 1.0
  - OpenID Information Cards 1.0, draft 1

Description: Library for reading and writing images - development
 OpenImageIO is a library for reading and writing images, and a bunch of
 related classes, utilities, and applications. Main features include:
 .
  * Extremely simple but powerful ImageInput and ImageOutput APIs for reading
    and writing 2D images that is format agnostic -- that is, a "client app"
    doesn't need to know the details about any particular image file formats.
    Specific formats are implemented by DLL/DSO plugins.
 .
  * Format plugins for TIFF, JPEG/JFIF, OpenEXR, PNG, HDR/RGBE, Targa,
    JPEG-2000, DPX, Cineon, FITS, BMP, ICO, RMan Zfile, Softimage PIC, DDS,
    SGI, PNM/PPM/PGM/PBM, Field3d, WebP. More coming! The plugins are really
    good at understanding all the strange corners of the image formats, and
    are very careful about preserving image metadata (including Exif, GPS, and
    IPTC data).
  .
  * An ImageCache class that transparently manages a cache so that it can access
    truly vast amounts of image data (thousands of image files totaling hundreds
    of GB) very efficiently using only a tiny amount (tens of megabytes at most)
    of runtime memory. Additionally, a TextureSystem class provides filtered
    MIP-map texture lookups, atop the nice caching behavior of ImageCache.
 .
  * Several image tools based on these classes, including iinfo (print detailed
    info about images), iconvert (convert among formats, data types, or modify
    metadata), idiff (compare images),igrep (search images for matching
    metadata). Because these tools are based on ImageInput/ImageOutput, they
    work with any image formats for which ImageIO plugins are available.
 .
  * A really nice image viewer, iv, also based on OpenImageIO classes (and so
    will work with any formats for which plugins are available).
 .
  * Supported on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
 .
  * All available under the BSD license, so you may modify it and use it in both
    open source or proprietary apps.
