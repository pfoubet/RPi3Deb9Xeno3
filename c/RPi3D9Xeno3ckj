Description: platform for handling a wide class of economic models
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package provides a full installation of Dynare, to be run on top of GNU
 Octave.

Description: Program to read/write Arcinfo compressed E00 files
 E00compr is an ANSI C library that reads and writes Arcinfo compressed E00
 files. Both "PARTIAL" and "FULL" compression levels are supported. E00 files
 are the vector import/export format for Arcinfo. It is plain ASCII and is
 meant as an interchange format. ESRI considers the format to be proprietary,
 so this package may not read all E00 files as ESRI may change the format.
 .
 This package is useful for importing E00 files into the grass GIS system.
 .
 It contains the e00conv command-line program, which takes a E00 file as
 input (compressed or not) and copies it to a new file with the requested
 compression level (NONE, PARTIAL or FULL). The library is not included
 at this stage.

 foundation of APIs
 .
 This package contains unstripped shared libraries. It is provided primarily
 to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat
 easier to interpret core dumps. The libraries are installed in
 /usr/lib/debug and are automatically used by gdb.

 the filtering to your exact needs. It can be as draconian or as
 unobstructive as you want. The default settings are geared towards what a
 primary school might want but e2guardian puts you in control of what you
 want to block.

Description: Undelete utility for the ext2 file system
 Interactive console tool to recover the data of deleted files on

 most people.
 .
 This tools searches all inodes marked as deleted on a file system and
 lists them as sorted by owner and time of deletion. Additionally,
 it gives you the file size and tries to determine the file type in
 the way file(1) does. If you did not just delete a whole bunch of
 files with a 'rm -r *', this information should be helpful to find
 out which of the deleted files you would like to recover.
 .
 E2undel will not work on ext3 (journaling) filesystems.

Description: command-line tools for processing biological sequencing data
 Ea-utils provides a set of command-line tools for processing biological
 sequencing data, barcode demultiplexing, adapter trimming, etc.
 .
 Primarily written to support an Illumina based pipeline - but should work with
 any FASTQs.
 .
 Main Tools are:
 .
  * fastq-mcf
 Scans a sequence file for adapters, and, based on a log-scaled threshold,
 determines a set of clipping parameters and performs clipping. Also does
 skewing detection and quality filtering.
  * fastq-multx
 Demultiplexes a fastq. Capable of auto-determining barcode id's based on a
 master set fields. Keeps multiple reads in-sync during demultiplexing. Can
 verify that the reads are in-sync as well, and fail if they're not.
  * fastq-join
 Similar to audy's stitch program, but in C, more efficient and supports some
 automatic benchmarking and tuning. It uses the same "squared distance for
 anchored alignment" as other tools.
  * varcall
 Takes a pileup and calculates variants in a more easily parameterized manner
 than some other tools.

Description: Library and utilities designed to disable fsync and friends
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and a couple
 of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like
 open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software that writes data
 safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe.
 .
 You will find eatmydata useful if particular software calls fsync(), sync()
 etc. frequently but the data it stores is not that valuable to you and you may
 afford losing it in case of system crash. Data-to-disk synchronization calls
 are typically very slow on modern file systems and their extensive usage might
 slow down software significantly. It does not make sense to accept such a hit
 in performance if data being manipulated is not very important.
 .
 On the other hand, do not use eatmydata when you care about what software
 stores or it manipulates important components of your system. The library is
 called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.

Description: Pinger for anonymous remailers such as Mixmaster
 A Pinger in the context of anonymous remailers is a program that
 regularly sends messages through remailers to determine their status.
 Based on the responses, the Pinger calculates reliability statistics
 which may be used by remailer clients to choose a chain of remailers to
 use.
 .
 Furthermore, Echolot collects configuration parameters and keys of
 remailers and offers the collected information in a format readable by
 remailer clients.  This helps reduce the administration effort required
 to use or host remailers.

Description: Small test tool for TCP servers
 echoping is a small program to test (approximatively) performances of a
 remote host by sending it requests such as HTTP requests.
 .
 In any case, be polite: don't bother the remote host with many repeated
 requests, especially with large size. Ask for permission if you often
 test hosts which aren't yours.
 .
 Current features:
    * plugins, so you can extend echoping with any protocol you like and/or use,
    * Supports IPv6 as well as IPv4,
    * Supports IDN (Unicode domain names),
    * uses the protocols echo, discard, chargen or HTTP,
    * can use cryptographic connections with HTTP,
    * uses UDP instead of TCP for the protocols which accept it (like echo),
    * can repeat the test and display various measures about it,

 integrated software-development tools. The Eclipse Platform allows tool
 builders to independently develop tools that integrate with other people's
 tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another starts.
 .

Description: Autotools support for Eclipse CDT
 The Autotools suite of plugins adds to the CDT a support for building and
 maintaining C/C++ projects that use Autotools. With this additional support,
 a vast repository of C/C++ code can be checked out, built, and maintained
 under the CDT rather easily without having to resort to the command line.
 .
 In conjunction with the CDT, the plugin can do the following:
  * Build a C/C++ project that uses a configure script or an autogen
    script or a Makefile.cvs script
  * Create a simple C or C++ hello world Autotools project via a template
  * Allow configuration parameters to be set via a gui and to rebuild when
    configuration parameters are changed
  * Colorized editing of configuration files such as configure.in, configure.ac,
    Makefile.am, and Makefile.in with full hover help for autoconf/automake
    macros
  * Allow specification of multiple build configurations for a single project
  * Run autotools such as autoconf, automake, or aclocal directly using a gui
    interface
  * Includes hover help for autoconf and automake macros in the editors

Description: 'perf' analysis tool integration for Eclipse CDT
 'perf' is a performance counters subsystem in Linux. Performance counters are
 CPU hardware registers that count hardware events such as instructions executed
 and cache-misses suffered. These counters aid in profiling applications to
 detect hotspots in the application. 'perf' provides per task, per CPU and
 per-workload counters, sampling on top of these and source code event
 annotation.
 .
 The perf plug-in for Eclipse allows the developer to execute profiles in their
 applications in a seamless way, using quick launch actions and visualizing
 the results in an user-friendly interface.

Description: framework for profiling tools for Eclipse CDT
 This package provides a common infrastructure that allows one to integrate
 various profiling tools into Eclipse IDE. It supports 3 categories of tools:
 .
  * Timing - measure the amount of time taken in functions and methods
  * Memory - profiles heap/stack/cache usage for an application
  * Coverage - measures how much of the code gets exercised in a run
 .
 In addition to this package, a plugin that integrates particular profiling tool
 (e.g. Valgrind or perf) is required in order to run performance analysis.

Description: Valgrind integration for Eclipse CDT
 The Linux Tools Project Valgrind plugin aims to provide simple and effective
 profiling for the C/C++ Development Tools.
 .
 Integration of these tools from Valgrind suite is provided:
 .
  * Memcheck *
 .
 Memcheck is a tool that detects memory management problems. It is Valgrind's
 most popular tool and seemingly the most mature. Memcheck's output is rather
 straight forward - it is a series of errors along with stack trace information.
 .
 The Valgrind View presents this output using a TreeViewer with the errors as
 top-level elements.
 .
 The stack trace is presented underneath the error and when a frame is
 double-clicked an editor will open and go to the line in question.
 .
 Markers represent memcheck errors inside the editor and are linked to the
 Problems View.
 .
 Includes an editor for Valgrind suppressions files featuring syntax
 highlighting, folding and code completion.
 .
  * Massif *
 .
 Massif is a heap profiling tool. It takes several "snapshots" during execution
 of your program detailing the various heap allocations throughout. It's output
 for each snapshot primarily consists the time of the snapshot, how many bytes
 were allocated that can be used, and how much extra was allocated than was
 asked. The unit of time can be configured to be instructions, milliseconds or
 bytes. At specified intervals, "detailed" snapshots are produced. These
 detailed snapshots contain a tree of heap allocations that comprise that
 snapshot. Unlike Memcheck, Massif does not yet support XML output. Massif's
 output is complex and as such requires creative ways of displaying it. Valgrind
 includes the ms_print program that is used to display Massif's output in a
 visually appealing manner. ms_print was used as a template for how to display
 this output.
 .
 The default view of the output is with a TableViewer. Snapshots are displayed
 as tabular data, just as ms_print does.
 .
 For detailed snapshots, an icon indicates the snapshot can be double-clicked
 and the View will display a TreeViewer of the detailed snapshots' heap
 allocation trees.
 .
 ms_print also provides a bar chart of bytes allocated throughout execution. In
 perhaps a more appropriate style, there is an option to display a detailed line
 chart of this data.
 .
 * Cachegrind *
 .
 Cachegrind performs cache and branching profiling. A Cachegrind profile run
 measures the number of cache misses and branch mispredictions performed by an
 application. The results of a Cachegrind profile run are displayed in the
 Valgrind view. These results show Cachegrind's cache/branch data in different
 levels of granularity.
 .
 Double-clicking on any file, function, or line will open the corresponding
 source file and place the cursor on the appropriate location (if the source can
 be resolved).
 .
 Integration with the CDT's parsed code model provides a user interface that
 resembles what you see in the Outline view.

Description: Task-Focused Interface for Eclipse
 Mylyn is a Task-Focused Interface for Eclipse that reduces information overload
 and makes multi-tasking easy. It does this by making tasks a first class part
 of Eclipse, and integrating rich and offline editing for repositories such as
 Bugzilla, Trac, and JIRA.
 .
 Once your tasks are integrated, Mylyn monitors your work activity to identify
 information relevant to the task-at-hand, and uses this task context to focus
 the Eclipse UI on the interesting information, hide the uninteresting, and
 automatically find what's related. This puts the information you need to get
 work done at your fingertips and improves productivity by reducing searching,
 scrolling, and navigation. By making task context explicit Mylyn also
 facilitates multitasking, planning, reusing past efforts, and sharing
 expertise.

Description: Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP)
 The Eclipse Platform is an open and extensible platform for anything and yet
 nothing in particular. It provides a foundation for constructing and running
 integrated software-development tools. The Eclipse Platform allows tool
 builders to independently develop tools that integrate with other people's
 tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another starts.
 .
 This package includes the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP), the basis upon
 which Eclipse RCP applications are built.

Description: prepares CD image files so they compress better
 The ECM format allows you to reduce the size of a typical CD image file
 (BIN, CDI, NRG, CCD, or any other format that uses raw sectors).
 It works by eliminating the Error Correction/Detection Codes (ECC/EDC) from
 each sector whenever possible. The encoder automatically adjusts to
 different sector types and automatically skips any headers it encounters.
 Since the data skipped is nearly impossible to compress with traditional
 tools, the resulting ECM file will compress far better than the raw CD image.

Description: estimate PCR barcode primers quality
 DNA barcoding is a tool for characterizing the species origin using a
 short sequence from a standard position and agreed upon position in the
 genome. To be used as a DNA barcode, a genome locus should vary among
 individuals of the same species only to a minor degree and it should
 vary among species very quickly. From a practical point of view, a
 barcode locus should be ﬂanked by two conserved regions to design PCR
 primers. Several manually discovered barcode loci like COI, rbcL, 18S,
 16S and 23S rDNA, or trnH-ps are routinely used today, but no objective
 function has been described to measure their quality in terms of
 universality (barcode coverage, Bc ) or in terms of taxonomical
 discrimination capacity (barcode speciﬁcity, Bs ).
 .
 ecoPCR is an electronic PCR software developed by LECA and
 Helix-Project. It helps to estimate Barcode primers quality. In
 conjunction with OBITools you can postprocess ecoPCR output to compute
 barcode coverage and barcode speciﬁcity. New barcode primers can be
 developed using the ecoPrimers software

Description: ecryptfs cryptographic filesystem (utilities)
 eCryptfs is a POSIX-compliant enterprise-class stacked cryptographic
 filesystem for Linux.
 .
 It provides advanced key management and policy features. eCryptfs stores
 cryptographic metadata in the header of each file written, so that encrypted
 files can be copied between hosts; the file will be decryptable with the
 proper key, and there is no need to keep track of any additional information
 aside from what is already in the encrypted file itself. Think of eCryptfs as
 a sort of "gnupgfs".
 .
 eCryptfs is a native Linux filesystem. The kernel module component of
 eCryptfs is part of the Linux kernel since 2.6.19.
 .
 This package contains the userland utilities.

 PCI parity errors are supported on all architectures (and are a
 mandatory part of the PCI specification).
 .
 Main memory ECC drivers are memory controller specific.  At the time
 of writing, drivers exist for many x86-specific chipsets and CPUs,
 and some PowerPC, and MIPS systems.
 .

Description: Biosignal acquisition device library (free plugins)
 eegdev is a library that provides a unified interface for accessing various
 EEG (and other biosignals) acquisition systems. This interface has been
 designed to be both flexible and efficient. The device specific part is
 implemented by the mean of plugins which makes adding new device backend
 fairly easy even if the library does not support them yet officially.
 .
 The core library not only provides to users a unified and consistent
 interfaces to the acquisition device but it also provides many
 functionalities to the device backends (plugins) ranging from configuration
 to data casting and scaling making writing new device backend an easy task.
 .
 This library is particularly useful to handle the acquisition part of a
 Brain Computer Interface (BCI) or any realtime multi-electrode acquisition
 in neurophysiological research.
 .
 This package contains the devices plugins that depends only on free
 components.

Description: Bookkeeping software for small and medium-size businesses
 EekBoek is a bookkeeping package for Dutch users; it creates reports such as
 a balance sheet ("Balans"), a general journal ("Journaal"), a general
 ledger ("Grootboek") and a VAT report ("BTW-aangifte").
 .
 Unlike other accounting software, EekBoek has a command-line interface: The
 EekBoek Shell (with tab completion).  It uses a database as back end: either
 PostgreSQL (using the eekboek-db-postgresql package) or SQLite.
 Interoperability is a key feature of EekBoek: editable text dumps of all your
 data are possible at any time.  EekBoek can generate an "XML Auditfile
 Financieel" (XAF) as used by Dutch tax office.  Furthermore, it has a
 complete Perl API to create your own custom applications.
 .
 The EekBoek documentation is available in Dutch only.
 .
 If you'd like to use EekBoek with a PostgreSQL back end (instead of the
 default SQLite), install the package eekboek-db-postgresql.
 If you'd like to use the Eekboek GUI, install the suggested package
 eekboek-gui.

Description: programs to send and receive fax messages
 efax is a small ANSI C/POSIX program that provides the data transport
 function for fax applications using any Class 1 or Class 2 fax modem.
 Another program, efix, converts between fax, text, bitmap and grayscale
 formats. fax, a shell script, provides a simple user interface to the efax
 and efix programs. It allows you to send text or Postscript files as faxes
 and receive, print or preview received faxes.
 .
 The ghostscript package is needed to fax Postscript files, and an image
 viewing program like xloadimage is needed to view incoming faxes.
 .
 Note that you probably have to adapt /etc/efax.rc to your needs.

 totally configurable.  Support for user defined programming languages, menu
 systems and key bindings are provided with many common defaults already
 defined.
 .
 eFTE is still a new project, however, extended from the FTE editor which was
 first released in 1995, so eFTE is tried and true with many features for the
 programmer/text editor.

Description: Advanced IRC Robot
 Eggdrop is an IRC bot written in C, which sits on channels and takes
 protective measures, such as preventing it from being taken over (in
 the few ways that anything can), recognizing banned users to reject
 them, recognizing privileged users to give them operator status,
 punishing users for things like flooding, among innumerable others.
 .
 All of this is completely configurable, and can be disabled or enabled
 as you wish in the configuration file. Also, it's very easy to expand
 and customize with Tcl scripts and C modules, making it possible to
 adapt Eggdrop to any special need you might have.

Description: reduction of population bias for genetic analyses
 The EIGENSOFT package combines functionality from the group's population
 genetics methods (Patterson et al. 2006) and their EIGENSTRAT stratification
 method (Price et al. 2006). The EIGENSTRAT method uses principal components
 analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and
 controls along continuous axes of variation; the resulting correction is
 specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral
 populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to
 detect true associations. The EIGENSOFT package has a built-in plotting
 script and supports multiple file formats and quantitative phenotypes.

Description: execute shell commands via XMPP (dangerous!)
 WARNING: USE THIS MODULE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!
 This module allows ejabberd administrators to remotely execute shell commands
 which could compromise both the ejabberd server and the whole machine.
 .
 This module provides the ejabberd server administrator a method to remotely
 execute shell commands through the ejabberd server.
 .
 It provides a page in the ejabberd Web Admin which only the administrators of
 the whole server can access.
 .
 Three types of commands are possible:
  * ejabberd_ctl: makes a call to ejabberd_ctl;
  * erlang shell: executes an erlang command;
  * system shell: executes a command on the system shell.
 The result of the execution will be shown.
 .
 In the system shell, only non-interactive commands will work correctly,
 for example this will work:
  ps -all
 Don't use commands that start an interactive mode:
 DON'T TRY THIS: top
 DON'T TRY THIS: vim readme.txt
 .
 This module does not check if the commands are dangerous or problematic,
 so this module is only recommended for experienced ejabberd and Erlang/OTP
 administrators. USE THIS MODULE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!

 Allows you to install and manage elisp code for Emacs. It supports lots of

 and 'remove' them, but more importantly it will 'init' them for you.
 .
 That means it will care about requiring the 'features' you need, loading
 the files, setting the 'Info' paths so that C-h i shows the new
 documentation you now depend on, and finally call your own :after function
 for you to setup the extension.

Description: A malloc(3) debugger
 Electric Fence is a debugger that uses virtual memory hardware to detect
 illegal memory accesses. It can detect two common programming bugs: software
 that overruns or underruns the boundaries of a malloc() memory allocation,
 and software that touches a memory allocation that has been released by
 free().
 .
 Unlike other malloc() debuggers, Electric Fence will detect read accesses as
 well as writes, and it will stop and pinpoint the exact instruction that
 causes an error. It is not as thorough as Purify, however.
 .
 In order to debug a program it needs to be linked with Electric Fence's
 library or dynamic linking needs to be used; README.Debian explains that in
 detail.

Description: Easy to use Bitcoin client
 This package provides a lightweight Bitcoin client which protects
 you from losing your bitcoins in a backup mistake or computer
 failure. Also, Electrum does not require waiting time because it does
 not download the Bitcoin blockchain.
 .
 Features of Electrum:
 .
   * Instant on: Your client does not download the blockchain. It uses a
     network of specialized servers that index the blockchain.
   * Forgiving: Your wallet can be recovered from a secret seed.
   * Safe: Your seed and private keys are encrypted on your hard drive.
     They are never sent to the servers.
   * Low trust: Information received from the servers is verified using
     SPV. Servers are authenticated using SSL.
   * No downtimes: Your client is not tied to a particular server; it
     will switch instantly if your server is down.
   * Ubiquitous: You can use the same wallet on different computers, they
     will synchronize automatically.
   * Cold Storage: Sign transactions from a computer that is always
     offline. Broadcast them using a machine that does not have your keys.
   * Reachable: You can export your private keys into other Bitcoin
     clients.
   * Established: Electrum is open source and was first released in
     November 2011.

Description: elektra configuration store, binaries
 Elektra provides a universal and secure framework to store configuration
 parameters in a hierarchical key-value pair mechanism, instead of each
 program using its own text configuration files. This allows any program
 to read and save its configuration with a consistent API, and allows
 them to be aware of other applications' configurations, permitting
 easy application integration. While architecturally similar to other OS
 registries, Elektra does not have most of the problems found in those
 implementations.

Description: All-Electron Density-Functional Electronic Structure Code
 Elk is an all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-plane wave
 (FP-LAPW) code. By not including pseudo-potentials, Elk can provide very
 reliable high-precision results and works for every chemical element. Features
 include:
 .
  * FP-LAPW basis with local-orbitals
  * APW radial derivative matching to arbitrary orders at muffin-tin surface
    (super-LAPW, etc.)
  * Arbitrary number of local-orbitals allowed (all core states can be made
    valence for example)
  * Total energies resolved into components
  * Forces - including incomplete basis set (IBS) and core corrections work
    with spin-orbit coupling, non-collinear magnetism and LDA+U
  * LSDA, GGA and (potential-only) meta-GGA functionals available
  * LDA+U: fully localised limit (FLL), around mean field (AFM) and
    interpolation between the two; works with SOC, NCM and spin-spirals
  * Isolated molecules or periodic systems
  * Core states treated with the radial Dirac equation
  * Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) included in second-variational scheme
  * Non-collinear magnetism (NCM) with arbitrary on-site magnetic fields
  * Fixed spin-moment calculations (with SOC and NCM)
  * Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) for linear optical
    response calculations
  * First-order optical response
  * Non-linear optical (NLO) second harmonic generation

Description: Logbook system to manage notes through a Web interface
 The Electronic Logbook (ELOG) provides a Web interface to manage notes.  Its
 general purpose is to make it easy for people to put and access information
 online; in the form of short, time stamped text messages with optional HTML
 markup for presentation, and optional file attachments.  ELOG has its own
 daemon, there is no need for a full-fledged server (e.g. Apache).  It stores
 notes as simple as plain text; no special formatting.  Its features:
 .
   * Personal logbooks: Personal notes can be written into ELOG and can then be
     retrieved from anywhere with a Web browser.
   * Shared logbooks: Logbooks can be shared by several people, for reading and
     optionally for writing.  Work groups can share and exchange information
     like in a (simplified) news group.
   * Small databases: Since arbitrary attributes can be defined for a logbook,
     it can be used as a small database with search facilities.
   * Problem collections: A system can consist of two logbooks, in one of which
     users enter bugs or problems.  Whenever someone adds a problem, an email
     is automatically sent to the administrator.
   * Shift logbooks: If the Allow delete and Allow edit flags are off, an entry
     cannot be modified once it's been entered.  This can be useful for shift
     logbooks for example in Physics experiments where each entry becomes a
     "document" with a time and author stamp.
   * File collections: Since files can be attached to ELOG entries, the system
     can be used to store and retrieve files.

Description: dependently typed functional programming language — emacs mode
 Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language: It has inductive
 families, which are like Haskell's GADTs, but they can be indexed by values and
 not just types. It also has parameterised modules, mixfix operators, Unicode
 characters, and an interactive Emacs interface (the type checker can assist in
 the development of your code).
 .
 Agda is also a proof assistant: It is an interactive system for writing and
 checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a foundational
 system for constructive mathematics developed by the Swedish logician Per
 Martin-Löf. It has many similarities with other proof assistants based on
 dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram and NuPRL.
 .
 This package contains the emacs interactive development mode for Agda. This

Description: Emacs minor mode that reindents code after every change
 electric-indent-mode is enough to keep your code nicely aligned when
 all you do is type. However, once you start shifting blocks around,
 transposing lines, or slurping and barfing sexps, indentation is
 bound to go wrong.
 .
 aggressive-indent-mode is a minor mode that keeps your code always
 indented. It reindents after every change, making it more reliable
 than electric-indent-mode.

Description: jump to things in Emacs tree-style
 This package provides a generic completion method based on building
 a balanced decision tree with each candidate being a leaf.  To
 traverse the tree from the root to a desired leaf, typically a
 sequence of `read-key' can be used.
 .
 In order for `read-key' to make sense, the tree needs to be
 visualized appropriately, with a character at each branch node.  So
 this completion method works only for things that you can see on
 your screen, all at once:
 .
  * character positions
  * word or subword start positions
  * line beginning positions
  * link positions
  * window positions
 .
 If you're familiar with the popular `ace-jump-mode' package, this
 package does all that and more, without the implementation
 headache.

Description: hiding or abbreviation of the mode line displays of minor-modes
 Minor modes each put a word on the mode line to signify that they're active.
 This can cause other displays, such as % of file that point is at, to run off
 the right side of the screen.  For some minor modes, such as
 mouse-avoidance-mode, the display is a waste of space, since users typically
 set the mode in their .emacs and never change it.  For other modes, such as
 jiggle-mode, it's a waste because there's already a visual indication of
 whether the mode is in effect.
 .
 A diminished mode is a minor mode that has had its mode line display
 diminished, usually to nothing, although diminishing to a shorter word or a
 single letter is also supported.  This package implements diminished modes.

 The user can input (i) characters from the beginning of the words of
 the desired match and (ii) substrings of the desired match.  For
 example, when matching "save-all-buffers", the user could input
 "sallb", and when matching "eval-buffer" the user could input
 "ebuffer".
 .
 The flx sorting algorithm implements an intelligent trade-off between
 word beginnings and contiguous substrings when ranking possible
 matches.

Description: state machine library
 fsm.el is an exercise in metaprogramming inspired by gen_fsm of
 Erlang/OTP. It aims to make asynchronous programming in Emacs Lisp
 easy and fun. By "asynchronous" I mean that long-lasting tasks
 don't interfer with normal editing.
 .
 Some people say that it would be nice if Emacs Lisp had threads
 and/or continuations. They are probably right, but there are few
 things that can't be made to run in the background using facilities
 already available: timers, filters and sentinels. As the code can
 become a bit messy when using such means, with callbacks everywhere
 and such things, it can be useful to structure the program as a
 state machine.
 .
 In this model, a state machine passes between different "states",
 which are actually only different event handler functions. The
 state machine receives "events" (from timers, filters, user
 requests, etc) and reacts to them, possibly entering another state,
 possibly returning a value.
 .
 The essential macros/functions are:
 ;;
 define-state-machine  - create start-FOO function
 define-state          - event handler for each state (required)
 define-enter-state    - called when entering a state (optional)
 define-fsm            - encapsulates the above three (more sugar!)
 fsm-send              - send an event to a state machine
 fsm-call              - send an event and wait for reply
 .
 fsm.el is similar to but different from Distel:
 <URL:http://fresh.homeunix.net/~luke/distel/>
 Emacs' tq library is a similar idea.

Description: Emacs incremental completion and selection narrowing framework
 Helm is incremental completion and selection narrowing framework for
 Emacs. It will help steer you in the right direction when you're
 looking for stuff in Emacs (like buffers, files, etc).
 .
 Helm is a fork of anything.el originally written by Tamas Patrovic and
 can be considered to be its successor. Helm sets out to clean up the
 legacy code in anything.el and provide a cleaner, leaner and more
 modular tool, that's not tied in the trap of backward compatibility.

Description: make Emacs bindings that stick around
 This is a package for GNU Emacs that can be used to tie related commands into
 a family of short bindings with a common prefix - a Hydra. Once you summon
 your Hydra through the prefixed binding (the body + any one head), all heads
 can be called in succession with only a short extension. Hydra can be vanished
 with any binding that isn't the Hydra's head (and that binding will call a
 proper command too). This makes the Hydra very seamless, it's like a minor
 mode that disables itself automagically.

 This package is an Emacs minor mode and allows you to edit one occurrence of
 some text in a buffer (possibly narrowed) or region, and simultaneously have
 other occurrences edited in the same way.
 .
 You can also use Iedit mode as a quick way to temporarily show only the
 buffer lines that match the current text being edited.  This gives you the
 effect of a temporary `keep-lines' or `occur'.  To get this effect, hit C-'
 when in Iedit mode - it toggles hiding non-matching lines.

Description: tagged workspaces in Emacs
 This package provides tagged workspaces in Emacs, similar to
 workspaces in windows managers such as Awesome and XMonad (and
 somewhat similar to multiple desktops in GNOME or Spaces in OS X).
 .
 perspective.el provides multiple workspaces (or "perspectives") for
 each Emacs frame. This makes it easy to work on many separate projects
 without getting lost in all the buffers.
 .
 Each perspective is composed of a window configuration and a set of
 buffers. Switching to a perspective activates its window
 configuration, and when in a perspective only its buffers are
 available by default.

Description: project interaction library for Emacs
 This library enhances Emacs with easy project management and
 navigation. The concept of a project is simple: just a folder
 containing a special file.  Currently git, mercurial, darcs and
 bazaar repos are considered projects by default.  So are lein, maven,
 sbt, scons, rebar and bundler projects.  If you want to mark a folder
 manually as a project just create an empty .projectile file in it.
 .
 Some of Projectile's features:
 .
   * jump to a file in project
   * jump to files at point in project
   * jump to a directory in project
   * jump to a file in a directory
   * jump to a project buffer
   * jump to a test in project
   * toggle between files with same names but different extensions
     (e.g. `.h` <-> `.c/.cpp`, `Gemfile` <-> `Gemfile.lock`)
   * toggle between code and its test (e.g. `main.service.js` <->
     `main.service.spec.js`)
   * jump to recently visited files in the project
   * switch between projects you have worked on
   * kill all project buffers
   * replace in project
   * multi-occur in project buffers
   * grep in project
   * regenerate project etags or gtags

Description: Emacs mode to colour-code delimiters according to their depth
 rainbow-delimiters is a "rainbow parentheses"-like mode which
 highlights delimiters such as parentheses, brackets or braces
 according to their depth. Each successive level is highlighted in a
 different color. This makes it easy to spot matching delimiters,
 orient yourself in the code, and tell which statements are at a given
 depth.
 .
 Great care has been taken to make this mode fast. You shouldn't see
 any change in scrolling or editing speed when it's on even when
 working in delimiter-rich languages like Clojure or Emacs Lisp. It
 can be used with any language.
 .
 You can customize the colors rainbow-delimiters uses. The default
 colors are intentionally subtle; they are unobtrusive enough to make
 the mode worth looking at even if you usually don't like rainbow
 parentheses modes. A number of major color themes such as Zenburn and
 Solarized have added their own faces for the mode.

Description: Emacs minor mode for handling undo history as tree
 Package undo-tree provided by this package replaces Emacs' undo
 system with a system that treats undo history as what it is: a
 branching tree of changes. This simple idea allows the more intuitive
 behaviour of the standard undo/redo system to be combined with the
 power of never losing any history. An added side bonus is that undo
 history can in some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more
 changes to accumulate before Emacs starts discarding history.

  * persistence by default: when you close file your folds don't disappear;
  * persistence scales well, you can work on hundreds of files with lots of
    folds without adverse effects;
  * it doesn't break indentation or something;
  * folds can be toggled from folded state to unfolded and back very easily;
  * quick navigation between existing folds;
  * you can use mouse to unfold folds (good for beginners and not only for
    them);
  * for fans of `avy' package: you can use `avy' to fold text with minimal
    number of key strokes!

Description: text mode directory tree
 ztree is a project dedicated to implementation of several text-tree
 applications inside GNU Emacs. It consists of 2 subprojects: ztree-diff and
 ztree-dir.
 .
 ztree-diff is a directory-diff tool for Emacs inspired by commercial tools
 like Beyond Compare or Araxis Merge. It supports showing the difference
 between two directories; calling Ediff for not matching files, copying
 between directories, deleting file/directories, hiding/showing equal
 files/directories.
 .
 ztree-dir is a simple text-mode directory tree for Emacs.

Description: fancy version of `zap-to-char' command
 This package provides two new commands `zzz-to-char' and `zzz-up-to-char'
 which work like built-ins `zap-to-char' and `zap-up-to-char', but allow you
 quickly select exact character you want to “zzz” to.
 .
 The commands are minimalistic and often work like built-in ones when there is
 only one occurrence of target character (except they automatically work in
 backward direction too). You can also specify how many characters to scan from
 each side of point.
 .
 This package uses avy as a backend.

Description: powerful clone of the vi/ex text editor (with X11 support)
 This package contains Elvis compiled with support for X11, Xft and
 background images.  If you don't need the X11 interface, install
 elvis-console instead.  See also: elvis-tools
 .
 Elvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor. It supports
 nearly all of the vi/ex commands, in both visual mode and ex mode.
 Elvis adds support for multiple files, multiple windows, a variety of
 display modes (including syntax highlighting, man, tex, html and
 hex), an optional X11 user interface, on-line help, folding, spell
 checking, new options, auto commands, regions, enhanced tags,
 printing, aliases and an improved :map command.
 .
 Like vi/ex, Elvis stores most of the text in a temporary file,
 instead of RAM. This allows it to edit files that are too large to
 fit in a single process' data space.
 Also, the edit buffer can survive a power failure or crash.

Description: speech output interface to Emacs
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.
 .
 Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs. Once Emacs is started with Emacspeak
 loaded, users get spoken feedback for all actions. As Emacs can do
 everything, they get speech feedback for everything they do.
 .
 This package recommends the speech server for the espeak (software)
 speech synthesizer, so it should work straight away. However it also
 contains the source for speech servers to support the DECtalk Express
 and DECtalk MultiVoice (hardware) speech synthesizers. For other
 synthesizers, look for speech server packages such as emacspeak-ss and
 eflite.

 The DOMAINATRIX programs were developed by Jon Ison and colleagues at MRC HGMP
 for their protein domain research. They are included as an EMBASSY package as
 a work in progress.
 .
 Applications in the current domainatrix release are cathparse (generates DCF
 file from raw CATH files), domainnr (removes redundant domains from a DCF
 file), domainreso (removes low resolution domains from a DCF file), domainseqs
 (adds sequence records to a DCF file), domainsse (adds secondary structure
 records to a DCF file), scopparse (generates DCF file from raw SCOP files) and
 ssematch (searches a DCF file for secondary structure matches).

Description: European molecular biology open software suite
 EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for
 the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software
 automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows
 transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive
 libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other
 scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS
 also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence
 analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards
 commercial software packages.

Description: war game of the century
 Empire is a console game simulation of a full-scale war between two
 emperors, the computer and you. Naturally, there is only room for
 one, so the object of the game is to destroy the other.
 .
 The world on which the game takes place is a square rectangle containing
 cities, land and water. Cities are used to build armies, planes, and
 ships which can move across the world destroying enemy pieces, exploring,
 and capturing more cities.
 .
 The classic game from the 1980s uses text mode graphical output, drawing
 your units, cities and the world in color. Commands are issued using
 the keyboard.

 empty is a utility that provides an interface to execute and/or interact with
 processes under pseudo-terminal sessions (PTYs). This tool is useful in
 programming of shell scripts designed to communicate with interactive programs
 like telnet, ssh, ftp, etc. In some cases empty can be the simplest
 replacement for Tcl/expect or other similar programming tools because empty
 can be easily invoked directly from shell prompt or script, and does not use
 Tcl, Perl, PHP, Python or anything else as an underlying language.

Description: image blending tool
 Enblend is a tool for compositing images. Given a set of images that overlap
 in some irregular way, Enblend overlays them in such a way that the seam
 between the images is invisible, or at least very difficult to see. It can,
 for example, be used to blend a panorama composed of several images.
 .
 It uses a Burt & Adelson multi-resolution spline. This technique tries to
 make the seams between the input images invisible. The basic idea is that
 image features should be blended across a transition zone proportional in
 size to the spatial frequency of the features. For example, objects like
 trees and windowpanes have rapid changes in color. By blending these
 features in a narrow zone, you will not be able to see the seam because the
 eye already expects to see color changes at the edge of these features.
 Clouds and sky are the opposite. These features have to be blended across a
 wide transition zone because any sudden change in color will be immediately
 noticeable.
 .
 Enblend does not align images for you. Use a tool like Hugin or PanoTools to
 do this. The TIFFs produced by these programs are exactly what Enblend is
 designed to work with.

Description: image exposure blending tool
 Enfuse blends differently exposed images of the same scene into a nice output
 image, without producing intermediate HDR images that are then tonemapped to a
 viewable image. This simplified process often works much better and quicker
 than the currently known tonemapping algorithms.
 .
 The exposure blending is done using the Mertens-Kautz-Van Reeth exposure
 fusion algorithm. The basic idea is that pixels in the input images are
 weighted according to qualities such as proper exposure, good contrast, and
 high saturation. These weights determine how much a given pixel will
 contribute to the final image.
 .
 Enfuse does not align images for you. Use a tool like Hugin or PanoTools to do
 this. The TIFFs produced by these programs are exactly what Enfuse is designed
 to work with.

Description: interactively extracts numbers from bitmap graphs or maps
 The Engauge Digitizer tool assists in interactively extracting numbers
 from images of graphs. Conceptually, it is thus the opposite of a
 graphing tool that converts data points to graphs. It provides assistance
 in enhancing the image quality and matching the data points. Engauge
 Digitizer is used by individuals such as grad students and researchers as
 well engineers and employees in large government and commercial
 organizations for processing single files  but also managing databases of
 thousands of image files.
 .
 Features of Engauge Digitizer include:
    * Automatic grid line removal
    * Automatic point and axis matching
    * Automatic curve tracing
    * Image processing for separating important details from background
      information
    * A wizard providing an interactive tutorial to explain the basic steps
    * Multiple coordinate systems in the same image can be digitized in
      advanced mode
    * Cubic spline interpolation between points gives more accurate curves with
      fewer points
    * Handling of Cartesian, polar, linear and logarithmic graphs
    * Support for drag-and-drop and copy-and-paste
    * Context sensitive help, user manual and tutorials explaining every
      feature
    * Preview windows to give immediate feedback while modifying settings
    * Automated line and point extraction to rapidly digitizes data

Description: Game where you control a marble with the mouse
 Enigma is a puzzle game similar to Oxyd on the Atari ST or Rock'n'Roll

 some interesting twists on the original sokoban concept.
 .
 In Enigma, your objective is to locate and uncover matching pairs of
 Oxyd stones. Simple as it sounds, this task is made more difficult by
 the fact that Oxyd stones tend to be hidden, inaccessible or protected
 by unexpected traps. Overcoming these obstacles often requires a lot
 of dexterity and wit (and can be quite addictive).

Description: Pregenerated level previews for Enigma
 Enigma is a puzzle game similar to Oxyd on the Atari ST or Rock'n'Roll
 on the Amiga and good old Marble Madness. It also has Sokoban levels, and
 some interesting twists on the original sokoban concept.
 .
 In Enigma, your objective is to locate and uncover matching pairs of
 Oxyd stones. Simple as it sounds, this task is made more difficult by
 the fact that Oxyd stones tend to be hidden, inaccessible or protected
 by unexpected traps. Overcoming these obstacles often requires a lot
 of dexterity and wit (and can be quite addicting).
 .
 This package contains thumbnails for enigma levels. If you have excess
 diskspace but a slow CPU or multiple users, you can install this package.
 It is however not needed for enigma operation, as thumbnails will be
 generated by the user on demand. Since generated thumbnails are stored in
 the users home directory, it is recommended to install this package on
 multi-user systems, to avoid having multiple copies.

Description: translate Dalvik bytecode to equivalent Java bytecode
 Android applications are Java programs that run on a customized virtual
 machine, which is part of the Android operating system, the Dalvik VM.
 Their bytecode differs from the bytecode of normal Java applications.
 .
 Enjarify can translate the Dalvik bytecode back to equivalent Java bytecode,
 which simplifies the analysis of Android applications.

Description: convert images into sounds
 Enscribe converts the scanlines of the input image into frequency
 components and then using an inverse Fast Fourier Transform, converts
 them into sound. The left side of the image is the low frequency end,
 and the right is the high end, up to just under the Nyquist limit if
 you want it to. There are several tunable parameters as to how colour
 is converted into stereo sound and the frequency range to be used.
 This conversion can be used to create resilient audio watermarks or to
 simply create interesting sounds from images.

Description: converts text to Postscript, HTML or RTF with syntax highlighting
 GNU Enscript takes ASCII files (often source code) and converts them
 to PostScript, HTML or RTF.  It can store generated output to a file
 or send it directly to the printer.
 .
 It is often used for its syntax highlighting, as it comes with rules
 for a wide range of programming languages.  New rules can be added
 using an awk-like stateful scripting language.

Description: infrastructure for distributing random numbers (entropy data)
 Entropy Broker is an infrastructure for distributing cryptographically secure
 random numbers (entropy data) from one or more servers to one or more clients.
 .
 It allows you to distribute entropy data (random values) to /dev/random
 devices from other systems (real servers or virtualised systems).
 It helps preventing that the /dev/random device gets depleted; an empty
 /dev/random-device can cause programs to hang (waiting for entropy data to
 become available).
 .
 This is useful for systems that need to generate encryption keys, run VPN
 software or run a casino website. Also virtual systems that have no good
 sources of entropy like virtual servers (e.g. VMware, XEN and KVM (although
 KVM has the virtio_rnd driver)).
 .
 Entropy Broker is an infrastructure consisting of client-daemons that fill
 /dev/random and server-daemons that feed the central entropy broker-server.
 The server-daemons can gather random values by measuring timer frequency
 noise, analysing noise from a unused audio-device, noise from a video source
 (webcam, tv-card) and random values from a real hardware RNG (random number
 generator).

Description: Modular system for handling environment variables
 The Modules package provides for the dynamic modification of a user's
 environment via modulefiles.  Each modulefile contains the information
 needed to configure the shell for an application. Once the Modules
 package is initialized, the environment can be modified dynamically
 on a per-module basis using the module command which interprets
 modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct the module command to alter or
 set shell environment variables such as PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles
 may be shared by many users on a system and users may have their own
 collection to supplement or replace the shared modulefiles.  The modules
 environment is common on SGI/Crays and many workstation farms.

Description: store for environment variables across shell processes
 envstore allows you to save environment variables into a separate store, list
 them, and reload them into the (other) shell again. It therefore provides a
 way to share them in cases where exporting to child processes is not feasible.
 .
 Included is envify, a shell script which loads the environment saved with
 envstore and then executes the command given to it.
 .
 A classic use case is MPD_HOST for clients of the Music Player Daemon.
 Commands to control the MPD would be wrapped with envify. If the MPD_HOST were
 then changed in envstore, it would automatically be used.

 these letters can be found in the standard ASCII character set. The
 remaining six -- `c', `g', `h', `j', and `s' with circumflex, and `u'
 with breve -- are not available in ASCII. Various encoding systems
 have been developed to represent Esperanto text in printed and typed text.

Description: Intuitive GNOME web browser
 Epiphany is a simple yet powerful GNOME web browser targeted at
 non-technical users. Its principles are simplicity and standards
 compliance.
 .
 Simplicity is achieved by a well designed user interface and reliance
 on external applications for performing external tasks (such as reading
 email). Simplicity does not mean less features; Epiphany has everything
 a modern web browser is expected to have.
 .
 Standards compliance is achieved on the HTML side by using the
 WebKitGTK+ rendering engine (which is based on the engine used by
 Apple Safari and Google Chrome); and on the user interface side by
 closely following the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and by
 close integration with the GNOME desktop.

Description: Circumvent Debian package dependencies
 This package provides a tool to create trivial Debian packages.
 Typically these packages contain only dependency information, but they
 can also include normal installed files like other packages do.
 .
 One use for this is to create a metapackage: a package whose sole
 purpose is to declare dependencies and conflicts on other packages so
 that these will be automatically installed, upgraded, or removed.
 .
 Another use is to circumvent dependency checking: by letting dpkg
 think a particular package name and version is installed when it
 isn't, you can work around bugs in other packages' dependencies.
 (Please do still file such bugs, though.)

Description: Quantum chemistry program for large-scale calculations
 ErgoSCF is a quantum chemistry program for large-scale self-consistent field
 calculations.  It employs modern linear scaling techniques like fast multipole
 methods, hierarchic sparse matrix algebra, density matrix purification, and
 efficient integral screening.  Linear scaling is achieved not only in terms of
 CPU usage but also memory utilization.  It uses Gaussian basis sets.
 .
 It can compute single-point energies for the following methods:
  * Restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock (HF) theory
  * Restricted and unrestricted Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT)
  * Full Configuration-Interaction (FCI)
 .
 The following Exchange-Correlational (XC) density functionals are included:
  * Local Density Approximation (LDA)
  * Gradient-corrected (GGA) XC functionals BLYP, BP86, PW91 and PBE
  * Hybrid XC functionals B3LYP, BHandHLYP, PBE0 and CAMB3LYP
 .
 Further features include:
  * Linear response calculations (polarizabilities and excitation energies) for
    restricted reference densities
  * External electric fields
  * Electron dynamics via Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF)

Description: Cherly (sher-lee) is an in-VM caching library for Erlang
 Cherly (sher-lee) was originally developed by Cliff Moon for erlang to deal
 with in memory caching based on LRU. Its functionality and performance were
 awesome, but as time goes on, its implementation gradually obsoletes and it's
 hard to maintain. To overcome these problems, I forked and made Cherly improve
 with original purposes. Main improvements are described below.
  * Replaced the hash storing structure (originally used Judy hash) with the
    combination of Open addressing and Tree structure based on golang's hash
    implementation. This structure is very scalable and stable.
  * Implemented slab allocator on off-heap.
  * Replaced implemantations of port driver with NIFs.
  * Rebarized

Description: Erlang/OTP application for automated testing
 Common Test is a portable application for automated testing. It is
 suitable for black-box testing of target systems of any type (i.e.
 not necessarily implemented in Erlang), as well as for white-box
 testing of Erlang/OTP programs. Black-box testing is performed via
 standard interfaces (such as SNMP, HTTP, Corba, Telnet, etc) and,
 if required, via user specific interfaces (often called test ports).
 White-box testing of Erlang/OTP programs is easily accomplished by
 calling the target API functions directly from the test case functions.
 Common Test also integrates usage of the OTP cover tool for code
 coverage analysis of Erlang/OTP programs.

Description: small Erlang app that provides fast event stream processing
 Goldrush is a small Erlang app that provides fast event stream processing
 .
 Features:
  * Event processing compiled to a query module
   - per module protected event processing statistics
   - query module logic can be combined for any/all filters
   - query module logic can be reduced to efficiently match event processing
  * Complex event processing logic
   - match input events with greater than (gt) logic
   - match input events with less than (lt) logic
   - match input events with equal to (eq) logic
   - match input events with wildcard (wc) logic
   - match input events with notfound (nf) logic
   - match no input events (null blackhole) logic
   - match all input events (null passthrough) logic
  * Handle output events
   - Once a query has been composed the output action can be overridden
     with an erlang function. The function will be applied to each
     output event from the query.

Description: distinct values estimator
 erlang-hyperloglog is an efficient algorithm for estimating the number of
 distinct elements, known as the cardinality, of large data ensembles, which
 are referred to here as multisets and are usually massive streams (read-once
 sequences).
 This problem has received a great deal of attention over the past two decades,
 finding an ever growing number of applications in networking and traffic
 monitoring, such as the detection of worm propagation, of network attacks
 (e.g., by Denial of Service), and of link-based spam on the web.

Description: implementation of Lua in Erlang
 An experimental implementation of Lua 5.2 written solely in pure Erlang
 .
 When to use Luerl:
 .
 Fast Language Switch: Luerl should allow you to switch between Erlang and Lua
 incredibly fast, introducing a way to use very small bits of logic programmed
 in Lua, inside an Erlang application, with good performance.
 .
 Multicore: Luerl provides a way to transparently utilize multicores. The
 underlying Erlang VM takes care of the distribution.
 .
 Microprocesses: It should give you a Lua environment that allows you to
 effortlessly run tens of thousands of Lua processes in parallel, leveraging
 the famed microprocesses implementation of the Erlang VM. The empty Luerl
 State footprint will be yet smaller than the C Lua State footprint.
 .
 Forking Up: Because of the immutable nature of the Luerl VM, it becomes a
 natural operation to use the same Lua State as a starting point for multiple
 parallel calculations.
 .
 However, Luerl will generally run slower than a reasonable native Lua
 implementation. This is mainly due the emulation of mutable data on top of an
 immutable world. There is really no way around this. An alternative would be
 to implement a special Lua memory outside of the normal Erlang, but this would
 defeat the purpose of Luerl. It would instead be then more logical to connect
 to a native Lua.
 .
 Some valid use cases for Luerl are:
  * Lua code will be run only occasionally and it wouldn't be worth managing
    an extra language implementation in the application;
  * the Lua code chunks are small so the slower speed is weighed up by Luerl's
    faster interface;
  * the Lua code calculates and reads variables more than changing them;
  * the same Lua State is repeatedly used to 'fork up' as a basis for
    massively many parallel calculations, based on the same state;
  * it is easy to run multiple instances of Luerl which could better utilise
    multicores.

Description: parser generator for Erlang
 Neotoma is a packrat parser-generator for Erlang for Parsing
 Expression Grammars (PEGs). It consists of a parsing-combinator
 library with memoization routines, a parser for PEGs, and a utility
 to generate parsers from PEGs.  It is inspired by treetop, a Ruby
 library with similar aims, and parsec, the parser-combinator library
 for Haskell.
 .
 Features include:
  - Simple, declarative parsers generated from even simpler grammars.
  - Fully integrated, single-pass lexical and syntactic analysis (a
    feature of PEGs).
  - Packrat-style memoization, boasting parse-time bound linearly to
    the input size (at the expense of memory usage).
  - In-place semantic analysis/transformation, supporting single-pass
    end-to-end in some applications.
  - Erlang code-generation for the lexical/syntactic analysis piece,
    with the option of semantic analysis/transformation inline, or in
    a separate module.
  - Line/column number tracking for easy resolution of parsing
    errors.

Description: Erlang/OTP various tools
 The Tools application contains a number of stand-alone tools, which are
 useful when developing Erlang programs.
 .
  cover - A coverage analysis tool for Erlang.
  cprof - A profiling tool that shows how many times each function
    is called. Uses a kind of local call trace breakpoints containing
    counters to achieve very low runtime performance degradation.
  eprof - A time profiling tool; measures how time is used in Erlang
    programs. Predecessor of fprof (see below).
  fprof - Another Erlang profiler; measures how time is used in Erlang
    programs. Uses trace to file to minimize runtime performance
    impact, and displays time for calling and called functions.
  instrument - Utility functions for obtaining and analyzing resource
    usage in an instrumented Erlang runtime system.
  make - A make utility for Erlang similar to UNIX make.
  tags - A tool for generating Emacs TAGS files from Erlang source
    files.
  xref - A cross reference tool. Can be used to check dependencies
    between functions, modules, applications and releases.

Description: ASN.1 to C or C++ or IDL compiler
 esnacc is short for "Enhanced Sample Neufeld ASN.1 to C Compiler" and ASN.1
 stands for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ITU-T X.208/ISO 8824).
 esnacc supports a subset of ASN.1 1988.
 .
 Given an ASN.1 source file(s) esnacc can produce:
 .
 1. C routines for BER encoding, decoding, printing and freeing.
 2. C++ routines for BER encoding, decoding, and printing.
 3. A type table that can be used with C driver routines
    for BER encoding, decoding, printing and freeing.
 .
 If you want to build esnacc based applications, you want to install
 the libesnacc-dev package, too.  Your application will then depend on
 the esnacc libraries, you find in the libesnacc180 package.

Description: ESO VLT Instrument pipeline collection
 In collaboration with the various instrument consortia, the Pipeline Systems
 Department has undertaken to implement data reduction pipelines for the most
 commonly used VLT/VLTI instrument modes.  These data reduction pipelines have
 three main purposes:
 .
  * Data quality control: Pipelines are used to produce the quantitative
    information necessary to monitor instrument performance.
 .
  * Master calibration product creation: pipelines are used to produce master
    calibration products (e.g. combined bias frames, super-flats, wavelength
    dispersion solutions).
 .
  * Science product creation: using pipeline-generated master calibration
    products, science products are produced for supported instrument modes
    (e.g. combined ISAAC jitter stacks; bias-corrected, flat-fielded FORS
    images, wavelength-calibrated UVES spectra). The accuracy of the science
    products can be limited both by the quality of the available master
    calibration products and by the algorithmic implementation of the
    pipelines themselves. In particular, adopted reduction strategies may not
    be suitable for all scientific goals.
 .
 This metapackage will install all ESO VLT pipelines along with the
 environments needed to run them (esorex, python-cpl).

Description: Execution Tool for European Southern Observatory pipelines
 EsoRex  is the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Recipe Execution Tool. It
 can list, configure and execute CPL-based recipes from the command line.
 .
 The Common Pipeline Library (CPL) comprises a set of ISO-C libraries that
 provide a comprehensive, efficient and robust software toolkit. It forms a
 basis for the creation of automated astronomical data-reduction tasks.
 .
 One of the features provided by the CPL is the ability to create
 data-reduction algorithms that run as plugins (dynamic libraries). These are
 called "recipes" and are one of the main aspects of the CPL data-reduction
 development environment.

 ESS ("Emacs Speaks Statistics") is a GNU Emacs and XEmacs mode for
 interactive statistical programming and data analysis. Languages
 supported are the S family (S 3/4, S-PLUS 3/4/5/6/7, and R), SAS,
 XLispStat, Stata, BUGS and Julia.
 .
 ESS grew out of the desire for bug fixes and extensions to S-mode and
 SAS-mode as well as a consistent union of their features in one
 package.
 .
 As of versions 16.04 or later, Emacs version 24 or later is required.

Description: Software for particle-based numerical modelling. MPI version.
 ESyS-Particle is Open Source software for particle-based numerical modelling.
 The software implements the Discrete Element Method (DEM), a widely used
 technique for modelling processes involving large deformations, granular flow
 and/or fragmentation. ESyS-Particle is designed for execution on parallel
 supercomputers, clusters or multi-core PCs running a Linux-based operating
 system. The C++ simulation engine implements spatial domain decomposition via
 the Message Passing Interface (MPI). A Python wrapper API provides flexibility
 in the design of numerical models, specification of modelling parameters and
 contact logic, and analysis of simulation data. ESyS-Particle has been
 utilised to simulate earthquake nucleation, comminution in shear cells, silo
 flow, rock fragmentation, and fault gouge evolution, to name but a few
 applications.

Description: store /etc in git, mercurial, bzr or darcs
 The etckeeper program is a tool to let /etc be stored in a git, mercurial,
 bzr or darcs repository. It hooks into APT to automatically commit changes
 made to /etc during package upgrades. It tracks file metadata that version
 control systems do not normally support, but that is important for /etc, such
 as the permissions of /etc/shadow. It's quite modular and configurable, while
 also being simple to use if you understand the basics of working with version
 control.

Description: create a virtual interface from a remote Ethernet interface
 Etherpuppet is a small program that will create a virtual interface
 (TUN/TAP) on one machine from the ethernet interface of another
 machine through a TCP connection. Everything seen by the real
 interface will be seen by the virtual one. Everything sent to the
 virtual interface will be emitted by the real one.
 .
 It has been designed because one often has a small machine as their
 Internet gateway, and sometimes want to run some big applications
 that need raw access to this interface, for sniffing (Wireshark,
 etc.)  or for crafting packets that do not survive being reassembled,
 translated, routed, etc.

Description: Binary tools to check, merge and read ETSF files
 The European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF) is a European
 network dedicated to providing support and services for ongoing
 research in academic, government and industrial laboratories.
 .
 The ETSF is divided into 7 beamlines, each of which is concerned with
 a specific scientific topic:
  - Optics ;
  - Energy Loss Spectroscopy ;
  - Quantum Transport ;
  - Time-resolved Spectroscopy ;
  - Photo-emission Spectroscopy ;
  - Vibrational Spectroscopy ;
  - X-Rays Spectroscopy.
 .
 To allow the adoption of its recommendations about standardization, the
 ETSF proposes different libraries and tools implementing or using these
 specifications, as well as widely usable pieces of software.
 .
 ETSF_IO is a library of F90 routines to read/write the ETSF file format.
 This package contains the user tools to:
  - check file conformance to the specifications;
  - extract data from files;
  - merge multiple files from parallel runs, as specified in the
    specifications.

Description: flexible OpenVPN authentication module
 This plug-in enhances OpenVPN by adding user name and password authentication.
 An eurephia user account is a combination of minimum one OpenVPN SSL
 certificate and a user name with a password assigned. It is also possible to
 setup several eurephia user names to use a shared OpenVPN certificate.
 .
 In addition, eurephia will blacklist IP addresses, certificates and user names
 on too many failed attempts and it supports dynamic update of iptables rules
 which restricts network access per connection.
 .
 All information is stored in a database and all changes to the accounts will
 be effective immediately. At the moment eurephia supports the SQLite database.

Description: flexible, full-featured audio player
 Exaile is a media player which incorporates many of the cool things from
 Amarok (and other media players) like automatic fetching of album art,
 handling of large libraries, lyrics fetching, artist/album information via
 Wikipedia, last.fm support, and optional iPod support (assuming you have
 python-gpod installed).
 .
 In addition, Exaile also includes tabbed playlists (so you can have more
 than one playlist open at a time), blacklisting of tracks (so they don't
 get scanned into your library), downloading of guitar tablature from
 fretplay.com, and submitting played tracks on your iPod to last.fm.
 .
 Exaile aims to be similar to AmaroK, but uses Python and GTK+.

Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.

Description: Automates interactive applications
 Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications according to a script.
 Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what
 the correct response should be. Expect is also useful for testing these same
 applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in
 X11 GUIs. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control
 structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and
 interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script.
 .
 This package contains the expect binary and several Expect based scripts.

Description: recover deleted files from ext3 or ext4 partitions
 ext4magic is a file carver (or file carving). It can be used when recovering
 from disasters or in digital forensics activities.
 .
 The deletion of files in ext3/4 filesystems can not be easily reversed. Zero
 out of the block references in the inodes makes that impossible. Experiences
 with other programs have proved that is possible restore sufficient information
 for a recover of many data files, directly from the filesystem journal.
 .
 ext4magic can extract the information from the journal and restore files in an
 entire directory tree, if the information in the journal are sufficient.
 .
 This tool can recover the most file types, with original filename, owner and
 group, file mode bits and also the old atime/mtime stamps.

Description: Extra modules and scripts for CMake
 Extra CMake Modules, or ECM, aims to augment CMake with additional modules. It
 serves as both a staging ground for new modules before they are moved upstream
 to CMake and a place for modules that, for whatever reason, are not a good fit
 for CMake itself.
 .
 It is primarily driven by the needs of the KDE community, but it is hoped that
 other projects will find it useful, and outside contributions are always
 welcome. The main rule for new modules is that there must be at least two
 downstream users.

Description: Extract page mode and named destinations as PDFmark from PDF
 When you create a PDF document using a TeX system, you may include
 many small PDF files in the main PDF file. It is common for each of
 those files to use the same fonts.
 .
 If the small PDF files contain embedded font subsets, the TeX system
 includes them as-is in the main PDF. As a result, several subsets of
 the same font are embedded in the main PDF. It is not possible to
 remove the duplicates since they are different subsets. This vastly
 increases the size of the main PDF file.
 .
 On the other hand, if the small PDF files contain embedded full font
 sets, the TeX system also includes all of them in the main PDF.
 This time, the main PDF contains duplicates of the same full sets of
 fonts. Therefore, Ghostscript can remove the duplicates. This may
 considerably reduce the main PDF-file's size.
 .
 Finally, if the small PDF files contain some fonts that are not
 embedded, the TeX system outputs the main PDF file with some fonts
 missing. In this case, Ghostscript can embed the necessary fonts.
 It can significantly reduce the required disk size.
 .
 Either way, when Ghostscript reads the main PDF produced by the
 TeX system and outputs the final PDF it does not preserve PDF
 page-mode and named-destinations etc. As a result, when you open
 the final PDF, it is not displayed correctly. Also, remote PDF
 links will not work.
 .
 This program is able to extract page mode and named destinations
 as PDFmark from PDF. By using this you can get the small PDF files
 that have preserved them.

Description: Daemon to receive images from Eye-Fi SD card
 EyeFi cards are SD cards that embed a small wifi chip. You can put one
 in your camera and receive the pictures automagically on your wifi
 network.
 .
 Unfortunately, these cards use a proprietary protocol only available on
 windows and macos.
 .
 This package will provide a compatible HTTP server, listening on port
 59278, that enables you to receive your pictures on your favorite os.

 as black boxes (for example for invocation from C).  Source level
 debugging facilities are not available, and error messages are not as
 well developed as in g77.

Description: test real flash memory capacity
 F3 (Fight Flash Fraud or Fight Fake Flash) tests the full capacity of a
 flash card (flash drive, flash disk, pendrive).
 .
 F3 writes to the card and then checks if can read it. It will assure you
 have not been bought a card with a smaller capacity than stated. Note that
 the main goal of F3 is not to fix your removable media. However, there
 are resources to mark the invalid areas.
 .

Description: simple face detector for batch processing
 Facedetect is a simple face detector for batch processing. It answers
 the basic question: "Is there a face in this image?" and gives back
 either an exit code or the coordinates of each detected face in the
 standard output.
 .
 The aim is to provide a basic command-line interface that's consistent
 and easy to use with software such as ImageMagick, while progressively
 improving the detection algorithm over time.
 .
 facedetect is used in software such as fgallery to improve the thumbnail
 cutting region, so that faces are always centered.

Description: toolset to rip audiostreams, cut, fade in/out and tag the resulting audiofiles
 fadecut is a script to rip audio files from a livestream and to process them
 automatically. Beginning and ending fo the audio files will be cut and faded
 in/out. So logos and advertising of radio stations will be automatically
 removed.
 .
 In streaming mode fadecut is ripping audio files using streamripper. The
 downloaded audio files are cutted using silence detection and then faded in
 and out. Subsequently, the files are encoded to either ogg or mp3 and tagged
 with tags (title, artist, genre and comment provided).
 .
 In file mode fadecut is just processing already ripped audio files.
 .
 An audio file which has already been processed is detected and will not be
 processed again. Not desired songs can be stored in a separate directory. This
 files are not processed anymore too.

Description: automatically prepare storage devices
 Using FAI disk_config files, setup-storage computes effective
 partition and volume sizes and executes the necessary commands
 to configure storage devices. It manages disk drives as well
 as RAID and LVM volumes. It handles all file systems supported
 by parted(8) as well as ntfs but is flexible enough to be
 extended to further types as well. Once the storage devices
 are prepared, an appropriate fstab(5) file is generated.
 .
 This package provides the setup-storage utility as separate
 package so it can be used independent from FAI as well.

 an IP using iptables or hostsdeny rules, or simply to send a notification
 email.
 .
 By default, it comes with filter expressions for various services
 (sshd, apache, qmail, proftpd, sasl etc.) but configuration can be
 easily extended for monitoring any other text file.  All filters and
 actions are given in the config files, thus fail2ban can be adopted
 to be used with a variety of files and firewalls.  Following recommends
 are listed:
 .
  - iptables -- default installation uses iptables for banning. You most
    probably need it
  - whois -- used by a number of *mail-whois* actions to send notification
    emails with whois information about attacker hosts. Unless you will use
    those you don't need whois
  - python3-pyinotify -- unless you monitor services logs via systemd, you
    need pyinotify for efficient monitoring for log files changes

Description: Memory allocation failure crash-test tool
 The idea behind failmalloc is to demonstrate what really happens if
 memory allocation fails. Unfortunately, most programs in this world are
 not robust, mostly because programmers are careless, but sometimes because
 programmers are too brave. Regardless of whatever reasons, the most
 critical problem is in that there is no good way to see such failures
 in reality, until a program is deployed into a heavy production system.
 Clearly, this is too late!
 .
 Failmalloc addresses this problem. Failmalloc inserts hooks into your
 program, which induces always, often or sometimes failures of memory
 allocation calls. The functions malloc, realloc and memalign are hooked,
 but other functions which use one of these functions are also affected.

Description: high availability load balancer for TCP connections
 Fair is a system for implementing load balancers; it consists of two daemons:
 carrousel and transponder. Carrousel, which performs load balancing services,
 typically runs on a load balancer; transponder runs on the servers.
 .
 Fair understands network topologies where one node is reachable via more than
 one IP address; this allows not only the servers, but the network to be
 redundant as well. This distinguishes fair from other load balancers.

Description: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware
 Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
 driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
 of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
 at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
 least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may
 be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to
 1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.
 .
 On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake
 clock "drifting" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.

Description: fake pop3 daemon. delivers same messages to all users
 fakepop is a fake pop3 daemon. It returns always the same messages
 to all users, it does not care about usernames and passwords. All
 user/pass combinations are accepted.
 .
 The main purpose of fakepop is to advice users that your server
 only accepts pop3-ssl and they have wrongly configured pop3 without
 ssl. You can customize messages in /etc/fakepop/ directory to teach
 your users how they should configure their mail clients to use
 pop3-ssl instead of pop3.
 .
 WARNING: some pop3-ssl daemons require a pop3 non-ssl package to be
 installed. That is why fakepop does not conflicts with pop3-server.
 courier-pop-ssl is one of these packages (it requires courier-pop).
 Before installing fakepop, be sure to disable other pop3 daemons.
 For courier, set POP3DSTART=NO in /etc/courier/pop3d

  * Subsequence extraction
  * Sequence statistics (currently only entropy is provided)
 .
 Sequence and subsequence extraction use fseek64 to provide fastest-possible
 extraction without RAM-intensive file loading operations.  This makes fastahack
 a useful tool for bioinformaticists who need to quickly extract many
 subsequences from a reference FASTA sequence.

Description: Tool for construction of phylogenetic trees of DNA sequences
 fastDNAml is a program derived from Joseph Felsenstein's version 3.3 DNAML
 (part of his PHYLIP package).  Users should consult the documentation for
 DNAML before using this program.
 .
 fastDNAml is an attempt to solve the same problem as DNAML, but to do so
 faster and using less memory, so that larger trees and/or more bootstrap
 replicates become tractable.  Much of fastDNAml is merely a recoding of the
 PHYLIP 3.3 DNAML program from PASCAL to C.
 .
 Note that the homepage of this program is not available any more and so
 this program will probably not see any further updates.

Description: handles qmail forwarding according to a cdb database
 It can create forwarding databases from a sendmail-style /etc/aliases or
 from user-oriented virtual-domain tables.
 .
 fastforward supports external mailing lists, stored in a binary format for
 fast access.  It has a tool to convert sendmail-style include files into
 binary lists.
 .
 fastforward is more reliable than sendmail.  sendmail can't deal with long
 aliases, or deeply nested aliases, or deeply nested include files;
 fastforward has no limits other than memory.  sendmail can produce corrupted
 alias files if the system crashes; fastforward is crashproof.
 .
 fastforward's database-building tools are much faster than sendmail's
 newaliases.  Even better, fastforward deliveries don't pause while the
 database is being rebuilt.
 .
 fastforward does not support insecure sendmail-style program deliveries from
 include files; you can use qmail's secure built-in mechanisms instead.

Description: maximum likelihood ancestral amino-acid sequence reconstruction
 FastML is a bioinformatics tool for the reconstruction of ancestral
 sequences based on the phylogenetic relations between homologous
 sequences. FastML runs several algorithms that reconstruct the ancestral
 sequences with emphasis on an accurate reconstruction of both indels and
 characters. For character reconstruction the previously described FastML
 algorithms are used to efficiently infer the most likely ancestral
 sequences for each internal node of the tree. Both joint and the
 marginal reconstructions are provided. For indels reconstruction the
 sequences are first coded according to the indel events detected within
 the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and then a state-of-the-art
 likelihood model is used to reconstruct ancestral indels states. The
 results are the most probable sequences, together with posterior
 probabilities for each character and indel at each sequence position for
 each internal node of the tree. FastML is generic and is applicable for
 any type of molecular sequences (nucleotide, protein, or codon
 sequences).

Description: phylogenetic trees from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences
 FastTree infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from
 alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences. It handles alignments
 with up to a million of sequences in a reasonable amount of time and
 memory. For large alignments, FastTree is 100-1,000 times faster than
 PhyML 3.0 or RAxML 7.
 .
 FastTree is more accurate than PhyML 3 with default settings, and much
 more accurate than the distance-matrix methods that are traditionally
 used for large alignments. FastTree uses the Jukes-Cantor or generalized
 time-reversible (GTR) models of nucleotide evolution and the JTT
 (Jones-Taylor-Thornton 1992) model of amino acid evolution. To account
 for the varying rates of evolution across sites, FastTree uses a single
 rate for each site (the "CAT" approximation). To quickly estimate the
 reliability of each split in the tree, FastTree computes local support
 values with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (these are the same as PhyML 3's
 "SH-like local supports").
 .
 This package contains a single threaded version (fasttree) and a
 parallel version which uses OpenMP (fasttreMP).

Description: FASTQ/A short nucleotide reads pre-processing tools
 The FASTX-Toolkit is a collection of command line tools for preprocessing
 short nucleotide reads in FASTA and FASTQ formats, usually produced by
 Next-Generation sequencing machines. The main processing of such FASTA/FASTQ
 files is mapping (aligning) the sequences to reference genomes or other
 databases using specialized programs like BWA, Bowtie and many others.
 However, it is sometimes more productive to preprocess the FASTA/FASTQ files
 before mapping the sequences to the genome—manipulating the sequences to
 produce better mapping results. The FASTX-Toolkit tools perform some of these
 preprocessing tasks.

Description: report system wide file access events
 fatrace reports file access events from all running processes.
 Its  main  purpose  is to find processes which keep waking up the disk
 unnecessarily and thus prevent some power saving.
 .
 This package also contains a "power-usage-report" tool, which uses
 fatrace and powertop to build a textual report from one minute of
 measuring power usage and file accesses. This does not take any
 arguments or requires any interactivity, so is very simple to use and
 serves as a starting point for bug reports or optimizing a particular
 installation.
