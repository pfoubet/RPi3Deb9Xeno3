cs components - documentation
 Commons Math is a Java library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics
 and statistics components.
 .
 Commons Math is made up of a small set of math/stat utilities addressing
 programming problems like the ones in the list below:
  - Computing means, variances and other summary statistics for a list of
  numbers
  - Fitting a line to a set of data points using linear regression
  - Finding a smooth curve that passes through a collection of points
  (interpolation)
  - Fitting a parametric model to a set of measurements using least-squares
  methods
  - Solving equations involving real-valued functions (i.e. root-finding)
  - Solving systems of linear equations
  - Solving Ordinary Differential Equations
  - Minimizing multi-dimensional functions
  - Generating random numbers with more restrictions (e.g distribution, range)
  than what is possible using the JDK
  - Generating random samples and/or datasets that are "like" the data in an
  input file
  - Performing statistical significance tests
  - Miscellaneous mathematical functions such as factorials, binomial
  coefficients and "special functions" (e.g. gamma, beta functions)
 .
 This is a part of the Apache Commons Project.
 .
 This package provides the API documentation for Commons Math.

Description: convenience library to use Java Management Extensions (JMX)
 Commons Modeler from the Apache Commons project simplifies using the Java
 Management Extensions (JMX). It provides the following services to
 application developers who wish to make their applications manageable via JMX:
  * Reads an XML-based description of the Model MBeans to be provided
    for a set of managed resources.
  * Provides a registry of these descriptions.
  * Supplies a base Model MBean implementation class that can be used
    for all management activities where the attribute accesses or
    operation calls are simply reflected on to the managed object.

Description: Apache Commons Net - Java client API for basic Internet protocols
 The Apache Commons Net library implements the client side of many basic
 Internet protocols. The purpose of the library is to provide fundamental
 protocol access, not higher-level abstractions. Therefore, some of the
 design violates object-oriented design principles. The philosophy is to
 make the global functionality of a protocol accessible (e.g., TFTP send
 file and receive file) when possible, but also provide access to the
 fundamental protocols where applicable so that a programmer may construct
 his own custom implementations (e.g, the TFTP packet classes and the TFTP
 packet send and receive methods are exposed).
 .
 The supported protocols include:
  * FTP/FTPS
  * FTP over HTTP (experimental)
  * NNTP
  * SMTP(S)
  * POP3(S)
  * IMAP(S)
  * Telnet
  * TFTP
  * Finger
  * Whois
  * rexec/rcmd/rlogin
  * Time (rdate) and Daytime
  * Echo
  * Discard
  * NTP/SNTP

Description: OCaml syntax extension for deriving "compare" functions automatically
 Pa_compare is a camlp4 syntax extension that derives comparison
 functions from type representations.
 .
 The scaffolded functions are usually much faster than OCaml's
 Pervasives.compare. Scaffolding functions also gives you more
 flexibilty by allowing you to override them for a specific type and
 more safety by making sure that you only compare comparable values.

 the map by. This implementation differs from
 java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap in that it
 maintains a page replacement algorithm that is

 capacity. Unlike the Java Collections Framework, this
 map does not have a publicly visible constructor and
 instances are created through a Builder.

 used to evict an entry when the map has exceeded its
 capacity. Unlike the Java Collections Framework, this
 map does not have a publicly visible constructor and
 instances are created through a Builder.

Description: module to load configuration from different file formats
 Config::Any provides a facility for Perl applications and libraries to load
 configuration data from multiple different file formats. It supports XML,
 YAML, JSON, Apache-style configuration, Windows INI files, and even Perl
 code.
 .
 The rationale for this module is as follows: Perl programs are deployed on
 many different platforms and integrated with many different systems. Systems
 administrators and end users may prefer different configuration formats than
 the developers. The flexibility inherent in a multiple format configuration
 loader allows different users to make different choices, without generating
 extra work for the developers. As a developer you only need to learn a single
 interface to be able to use the power of different configuration formats.

 Config::ApacheFormat is designed to parse a configuration file in the same

 details).  This allows you to build applications which can be easily
 managed by experienced Apache admins.  Also, by using this module,
 you'll benefit from the support for nested blocks with built-in
 parameter inheritance.  This can greatly reduce the amount or repeated
 information in your configuration files.

Description: magical config file parser
 Config::Auto allows developers to parse config files without
 needing to specify the format of the file (though they can do it).
 .
 It even looks for the config file in standard places (working dir,
 home dir, /etc) and tries some common config file names if the path
 isn't specified in the call.
 .
 It then determines the format of the config file, parses it and then
 returns a data structure containing the configuration data. The format
 of this structure depends on the format of the file.
 .
 At the moment, libconfig-auto-perl knows about colon, space and equals
 separated, XML, Perl, Windows INI, BIND9 and irssi style config files,
 though files in BIND9 or irssi format cannot be parsed.

Description: module to read/write Vixie-compatible crontab(5) files
 Config::Crontab provides an object-oriented interface to Vixie-style
 crontab(5) files for Perl.
 .
 In short, Config::Crontab reads and writes crontab(5) files (and does a
 little pretty-printing too) using objects. The general idea is that you
 create a Config::Crontab object and associate it with a file (if
 unassociated, it will work over a pipe to crontab -l). From there, you can
 add lines to your crontab object, change existing line attributes, and write
 everything back to file.

 inspired by the well known Apache configuration format, in fact, this
 module is fully capable of parsing Apache configurations, but the
 output is not usable by Apache. You can also just use simple name/value
 pairs in your configuration files.
 .
 In addition to the capabilities of an Apache configuration file it
 supports some enhancements such as here-documents, C-style comments and
 multi-line options.

Description: Perl module for Git-compatible config file parsing
 Config::GitLike provides a Perl interface for parsing, writing, and managing
 configuration files of the format used by the version control system Git. It
 supports config-file inheritance in the same way that Git does: system-wide,
 user-wide, and per-directory config files can be specified and loaded, with
 values from more local files overriding those in less-local files.
 .

Description: grammar-based user-friendly config parser
 Config::Grammar is a module to parse configuration files. The configuration
 may consist of multiple-level sections with assignments and tabular data. The
 parsed data will be returned as a hash containing the whole configuration.
 Config::Grammar uses a grammar that is supplied upon creation of a
 Config::Grammar object to parse the configuration file and return helpful
 error messages in case of syntax errors. Using the makepod method you can
 generate documentation of the configuration file format.
 .
 The maketmpl method can generate a template configuration file. If your
 grammar contains regexp matches, the template will not be all that helpful as
 Config::Grammar is not smart enough to give you sensible template data based
 in regular expressions. The related function maketmplmin generates a minimal
 configuration template without examples, regexps or comments and thus allows
 an experienced user to fill in the configuration data more efficiently.

 implementing yet another slightly different take on the undeniably easy to

Description: config-model reader and writer powered by Augeas
 Config::Model::Backend::Augeas provides a way to load or store
 configuration data through Config::Augeas. This way, the structure and
 commments of the original configuration file are preserved.
 .
 With Config::Model::Backend::Augeas, Config::Model now provides a way
 to load and save data through RedHat's Augeas library.
 .
 Config::Model and Augeas are both configuration editing tool. Both
 parse configuration files in their native formats and transforms them
 into a tree. Configuration changes are made by manipulating this tree
 and saving it back into native config files.
 .
 Both Augeas and Config::Model rely on a tree to represent
 configuration data.
 .
 On one side, Augeas is able to load and write data while respecting
 the structure and comments of the original configuration file. But
 Augeas purpose is not to validate the semantic content of the
 configuration file.
 .
 On the other side, Config::Model is able to validate the semantic
 content of the configuration file, but it may discard all comments and
 will write back configuration data using a canonical order. Thus the
 structure of the original configuration file is not preserved.
 .
 You can now have the best of both worlds by using the Augeas library
 to load and write data from Config::Model configuration tree. You can
 now instruct Config::Model to use Augeas. See
 Config::Model::BackendMgr for details.
 .
 Unfortunately, you must ensure that the tree representation specified
 in Config::Model and Augeas lens are quite close together:
   - Config::Model element names and Augeas lens names must be identical
   - Both structures must be very close. Each Config::Model node must
     have a corresponsing lens.
 .
 See Config::Model::Backend::Augeas documentation to use Augeas with
 your configuration model.
 .

 .
 The command 'cme check dpkg' provide a command line that will check the
 package file, a bit like lintian. But this command must be run in the
 source package directory and can be run before building the package.
 .
 Likewise, the command 'cme fix dpkg' will fix most of the warnings
 found by the command above.
 .
 The command 'cme update dpkg' will update debian/copyright file
 from the content of the package source file.
 .
 If the recommended package libconfig-model-tkui-perl is installed,
 you can run 'cme edit dpkg' to edit your package files with a GUI.
 .
 You can also run cme with a more restricted scope with:
  * cme edit|check|fix dpkg-control
  * cme edit|check|fix dpkg-copyright
 .
 For best results, you should install the latest available version
 of libmodule-corelist-perl.

Description: graphical model editor for Config::Model
 Config::Model::Itself module is a plugin for cme which provides a
 Perl/Tk graphical interface to edit configuration models that are be
 used by Config::Model.
 .
 Config::Model::Itself also provides a model for Config::Model
 (hence the Itself name, you can also think of it as a meta-model).
 The model editor will use this meta-model to construct the graphical
 interface so you can edit the configuration model for *your*
 application. [ Config::Model::Itself is the "eat your own dog food" principle
 applied to Config::Model ;-) ]
 .
 Let's step back a little to explain. Any configuration data is, in
 essence, structured data. This data could be stored, for instance, in
 an XML file. A configuration model is a way to describe the structure
 and relation of all items of a configuration data set.
 .
 This configuration model is also expressed as structured data. This
 structure data is structured and follows a set of rules which are
 described for humans in Config::Model.
 .
 The structure and rules documented in Config::Model are also expressed
 in a model in the files provided with Config::Model::Itself.
 .
 Hence the possibity to verify, modify configuration data provided by
 Config::Model can also be applied on configuration models.
 .
 The model editor program launched with "cme meta edit"

Description: module for describing and editing configuration data
 Config::Model is a Perl framework that enables project developers to provide
 an interactive configuration system for their software. It supports various
 frontend interfaces (graphical, curses-based or plain terminal) to users. It
 handles configuration files semantically rather than syntactically, meaning
 that developers can specify the structure and constraints of the data along
 with a mechanism to read and write the files.
 .
 Using the structure and constraint information, Config::Model will generate
 interactive configuration editors that include help and data validation. It
 is equally simple to use graphical (via Tk) interfaces as well as curses-
 and ReadLine-based terminal interfaces.
 .
 Config::Model also provides a facility to help configuration data upgrade
 that can be triggered during package upgrades.
 .
 Config::Model provides configuration model and editor for:
  - popularity-contest
  - fstab (/etc/fstab)
  - multistrap
 .
 Other configuration editors are available with other libconfig-model-*-perl
 packages.
 .
 Depending on which suggested or recommended modules are installed,
 Config::Model provides several user interfaces:
  - shell-like interface (with any of lib-term-readlin-*-perl)
  - virtual file system where each config parameter is mapped to a file
   (with fuse package)
  - graphical user interface (with libconfig-model-tkui-perl)

 For instance, with this package and libconfig-model-openssh-perl
 Config::Model::OpenSsh, you get a graphical configuration editor for
 /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
 .
 To get the graphical editor, just install Config::Model::TkUI, and the

 can use that object to fully configure your library or application. The
 sequence will contain a bunch of Config::MVP::Section objects, each of which
 is meant to provide configuration for a part of your program. Most of these
 sections will be directly related to a Perl library that you'll use as a
 plugin or helper. Each section will have a name, and every name in the
 sequence will be unique.

Description: facility for creating read-only scalars, arrays, and hashes
 Const::Fast is a perl module for creating read-only scalars, arrays,
 and hashes. It enables you to set a variable to the given value and
 subsequently make it readonly. Arrays and hashes will be made deeply
 readonly.
 .
 This module uses the builtin readonly feature of perl, making access
 to the variables just as fast as any normal variable without the
 weird side-effects of ties.

Description: Perl module to preserve calling context
 Context::Preserve allows developers to preserve the calling context of their
 subroutines, which is useful for functions that call other functions and
 return their results, with some possible modifications. This means that, if
 your module is called in scalar, list or void context, the given subroutine
 is called in the same context and the appropriate 'thing' is returned.
 .
 This means that it is easy to write functions that call other functions,
 modify their result and return it, in a seamless manner.

Description: Binary Data Conversion using C Types
 Convert::Binary::C is a preprocessor and parser for C type definitions. It is
 highly configurable and supports arbitrarily complex data structures. Its
 object-oriented interface has pack and unpack methods that act as replacements
 for Perl's pack and unpack and allow one to use C types instead of a string
 representation of the data structure for conversion of binary data from and to
 Perl's complex data structures.
 .
 Actually, what Convert::Binary::C does is not very different from what a C
 compiler does, just that it doesn't compile the source code into an object
 file or executable, but only parses the code and allows Perl to use the
 enumerations, structs, unions and typedefs that have been defined within your
 C source for binary data conversion, similar to Perl's pack and unpack.

Description: cache abstraction library for Clojure
 core.cache is a Clojure library that provides implementations of basic
 caching strategies such as:
 .
  * First-in-first-out (FIFOCache)
  * Least-recently-used (LRUCache)
  * Least-used (LUCache -- sometimes called Least Frequently Used)
  * Time-to-live (TTLCache)
  * Naïve cache (BasicCache)
  * Naïve cache backed with soft references (SoftCache)
  * Low inter-reference recency set algorithm (LIRSCache)
 .
 All implementation use a common base abstraction (CacheProtocol) which, in
 combination with suitable macros, allows for the easy integration of user
 defined caching strategies that hook into the Clojure associative data
 capabilities.

 output. The output may go to the screen (in a GUI), to an
 image or to a PDF file.

 The main target for content is XHTML 1.0 (strict), an XML
 document format that standardizes HTML. However,
 xhtmlrenderer accepts any well-formed XML for rendering as
 long as CSS is provided that tells how to lay it out.
 .
 In the case of XHTML, default stylesheets are provided out

Description: Perl framework implementing coroutines
 Coro is a collection of modules which manages continuations in general, most
 often in the form of cooperative threads (also called coros, or simply "coro"
 in the documentation). They do not actually execute at the same time, even on
 machines with multiple processors.
 .
 The specific flavor of thread offered by this module also guarantees you that
 it will not switch between threads unless necessary. It switches at easily-
 identified points in your program, so locking and parallel access are rarely
 an issue, making threaded programming much safer and easier than using other
 threading models.
 .
 Coro provides a full shared address space, which makes communication between
 threads very easy. A parallel matrix multiplication benchmark runs over 300
 times faster on a single core than perl's ithreads on a quad core using all
 four cores.
 .
 This version of Coro has been patched by the Debian Project to provide
 compatibility with Perl 5.22 and Perl 5.24. Please send bug reports to
 Debian (<https://www.debian.org/Bugs/>) and not the original author.

 This library enhances the Threads library of the standard OCaml distribution
 in two dimensions:
 .
 - It implements the same API of the standard Threads library on different
 execution engines (process, networker), so that a single copy of
 source code can be compiled and deployed to different environments
 without modification.
 - It is also a super set of the standard Threads library, with extra
 components (STM etc.), functions (spawn etc.) and features (object-level
 compatibility etc.).
 .
 This package provides static libraries, interfaces, and documentation
 for coThreads.

Description: portable C++ classes used by acovea
 The classes provided here do not easily fit into a single category; in
 essence, these are tools that the author of the acovea package has found
 useful in a variety of applications.
 .
 Among the algorithms included:
 .
   - a polymorphic collection of the best pseudorandom number generators,
     including the Mersenne Twister and Marsaglia's favorites.
 .
   - utilities for working with real numbers, including additional functions
     for trigonometry, least common multiple, greatest common denominator,
     rounding, and other purposes.
 .
   - a simple cross-platform command-line parser.
 .
   - a framework for generating rectangular mazes.
 .
   - a template for fixed-point math based on different integer sizes and
     decimal point locations.
 .
   - templatized sorting utilities (designed before standard C++'s use
     of <algorithms>, but still useful).
 .
   - validation tools for "Design by Contract" programming.

 the CPAN Shell, with the full automatic recursive dependency resolution.
 .
 This package also provides a command line utility, cpaninject, which can be
 used to inject arbitrary packages under the officially blessed "Reserved
 Local CPAN Author" id, LOCAL.

Description: turnkey CPAN Testers smoking module
 Rudimentary smoke tester for CPAN Testers, built upon CPAN::Reporter. Use at
 your own risk. It requires a recent version of CPAN::Reporter to run.
 .
 Currently, CPAN::Reporter::Smoker requires zero independent configuration;
 instead it uses configuration settings from CPAN.pm and CPAN::Reporter.
 .
 Once started, it retrieves a list of distributions from the configured CPAN
 mirror and begins testing them in reverse order of upload. It will skip any
 distribution which has already had a report sent by CPAN::Reporter.
 .
 Features:
  * No configuration needed
  * Tests each distribution as a separate CPAN process -- each distribution
    has prerequisites like build_requires satisfied from scratch
  * Automatically checks for new distributions every twelve hours or as
    otherwise specified
  * Continues until interrupted with CTRL-C
  * Checks CPAN.pm "distroprefs" to see if distributions should be skipped
    (before handing off to CPAN)

Description: module for fast and correct serialising to JSON
 Cpanel::JSON::XS converts Perl data structures to JSON and vice versa. Its
 primary goal is to be correct and its secondary goal is to be fast. To reach
 the latter goal it was written in C.
 .
 As this is the n-th-something JSON module on CPAN, what was the reason to
 write yet another JSON module? While it seems there are many JSON modules,
 none of them correctly handle all corner cases, and in most cases their
 maintainers are unresponsive, gone missing, or not listening to bug reports
 for other reasons.

Description: ESO library for automated astronomical data-reduction
 The Common Pipeline Library (CPL) comprises a set of ISO-C libraries that
 provide a comprehensive, efficient and robust software toolkit. It forms a
 basis for the creation of automated astronomical data-reduction tasks (known
 as "pipelines").
 .
 The CPL was developed to standardise the way instrument pipelines
 are built, to shorten their development cycle and to ease their
 maintenance. However, it may be more generally applied to any similar
 application, and the details of the CPL code have been engineered in
 a way to make the library portable and flexible, as well as
 minimising external dependencies.
 .
 The CPL provides a host of functionality, presented in a clear,
 generic and uniform manner. Among its many features, the CPL offers:
 .
  * many useful low-level data types (images, tables, matrices, strings,
    property lists, ...),
  * many fundamental statistic, arithmetic and conversion operations for
    these data types.
  * medium-level data access methods (e.g. a data abstraction layer for
    FITS files),
  * data table organisation and manipulation,
  * keyword/value handling and management,
  * a standardised application interface for pipeline recipes, and,
  * support for dynamic loading of recipe modules.
 .
 Despite the current bias towards instrument pipeline development, the
 library also provides a variety of general-purpose image- and
 signal-processing functions, making it an excellent framework for the
 creation of more generic data-handling packages.
 .
 This package contains the static library and the C header files.

Description: SQL Connectivity Library (development files)
 CppDB is an SQL connectivity library that is designed to provide platform and
 Database independent connectivity API similarly to what JDBC, ODBC and other
 connectivity libraries do.
 .
 This library is developed as part of CppCMS Project - the C++ Web Development
 Framework.
 .
 CppDB was designed with following goals in the mind:
  - Performance is the primary goal - make fastest possible SQL connectivity as
    possible
  - Transparent connection pooling support
  - Transparent prepared statements caching
  - Dynamic DB modules loading and optional static linking
  - Full and high priority support of FOSS RDBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite3
  - Support as many RDBMSs as possible via cppdb-odbc bridge
  - Simplicity in use
  - Locale safety
  - Support of both explicit verbose API and brief and nice syntactic sugar
 .
 This package contains the development files.

    Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 by providing asynchronous C++ bindings
    to HTTP, JSON, and URIs
  * Implementation of Asynchronous Streams and Stream Buffers
  * A consistent and powerful model for composing asynchronous operations based
    on C++ 11 features
  * A set of samples and reference documentation
  * New experimental features such as HTTP Listener library and support for
  Windows Phone 8 and Windows XP.
 .
 This package contains header files that are needed to develop and

Description: library for cyclic redundancy check (CRC) computation - development files
 Crcutil library provides efficient implementation of CRC algorithms. It
 includes reference implementation of a novel Multiword CRC algorithm
 invented by Andrew Kadatch and Bob Jenkins in early 2007. The new
 algorithm is heavily tuned towards modern Intel and AMD processors and is
 substantially faster than almost all other software CRC algorithms.
 .
 Included whitepaper describes the details of Multiword CRC algorithm as
 well as other algorithms and CRC manipulation routines implemented by
 crcutil library.
 .
 Crcutil library computes:
  * Hardware-assisted CRC32C: 0.13 (Nehalem) CPU cycles per byte.
  * 64-bit and smaller CRCs: 1.0 (Nehalem) - 1.2 (Core) CPU cycles per byte.
  * 128-bit CRCs: 1.7 CPU cycles per byte.
 .
 Since computational speed of 64-bit CRCs is identical to 32-bit and
 16-bit, the use of crcutil library enables widespread use of more reliable
 64-bit CRCs instead of 32-bit ones.

Description: library for cyclic redundancy check (CRC) computation - documentation
 Crcutil library provides efficient implementation of CRC algorithms. It
 includes reference implementation of a novel Multiword CRC algorithm
 invented by Andrew Kadatch and Bob Jenkins in early 2007. The new
 algorithm is heavily tuned towards modern Intel and AMD processors and is
 substantially faster than almost all other software CRC algorithms.
 .
 Included whitepaper describes the details of Multiword CRC algorithm as
 well as other algorithms and CRC manipulation routines implemented by
 crcutil library.
 .
 Crcutil library computes:
  * Hardware-assisted CRC32C: 0.13 (Nehalem) CPU cycles per byte.
  * 64-bit and smaller CRCs: 1.0 (Nehalem) - 1.2 (Core) CPU cycles per byte.
  * 128-bit CRCs: 1.7 CPU cycles per byte.
 .
 Since computational speed of 64-bit CRCs is identical to 32-bit and
 16-bit, the use of crcutil library enables widespread use of more reliable
 64-bit CRCs instead of 32-bit ones.
 .
 As a bonus, crcutil also implements a number of useful CRC "tricks" (e.g.
 computation of CRC of concatenated blocks of data of known length and CRC
 without touching actual data).
 .
 This package provides PDF documentation.

Description: O'Caml library that implements exact real arithmetic
 This  module  implements  exact  real  arithmetic,  following  Valerie
 Menissier-Morain Ph.D. thesis (http://www-calfor.lip6.fr/~vmm/).
 .
 A  real  x  is  represented  as  a function  giving,  for  any  n,  an
 approximation zn/4^n of x  such that |zn/4^n - x| < 1,  where zn is an
 arbitrary precision integer (of type Gmp.Z.t).
 .
 Coercions from type int, Gmp.Z.t, Gmp.Q.t, basic operations (addition,
 subtraction,  multiplication,   division,  power,  square   root)  and
 transcendental  functions (sin,  cos, tan,  log, exp,  arcsin, arccos,
 etc.) and a few constants (pi, e) are provided.
 .
 A small reverse-polish calculator is provided to test the library.

Description: Perl pragma to enforce coding standards and best-practices
 The cristicism pragma enforces coding standards and promotes best-practices
 by running your file through Perl::Critic before every execution. In a
 production system, this usually isn't feasible because it adds a lot of
 overhead at start-up. If you have a separate development environment,
 you can effectively bypass the "criticism" pragma by not installing
 Perl::Critic in the production environment. If Perl::Critic can't be
 loaded, then "criticism" just fails silently.

Description: Triple-DES EDE encryption/decryption for perl
 Crypt::DES_EDE3 implements DES-EDE3 encryption. This is triple-DES
 encryption where an encrypt operation is encrypt-decrypt-encrypt, and
 decrypt is decrypt-encrypt-decrypt. This implementation uses Crypt::DES
 to do its dirty DES work, and simply provides a wrapper around that
 module: setting up the individual DES ciphers, initializing the keys,
 and performing the encryption/decryption steps.
 .
 You're probably best off not using this module directly, as the encrypt
 and decrypt methods expect 8-octet blocks. You might want to use the
 module in conjunction with Crypt::CBC, for example. This would be
 DES-EDE3-CBC, or triple-DES in outer CBC mode.

Description: Crypt::DH replacement that uses GMP directly
 Crypt::DH::GMP is a (somewhat) portable replacement to Crypt::DH, implemented
 mostly in C.
 .
 In the beginning, there was Crypt::DH. However, Crypt::DH suffers from a
 couple of problems: GMP/Pari libraries are almost always required; Crypt::DH
 additionally has Math::BigInt in between GMP. Instantiating an object
 comes with a relatively high cost, and if you make many computations in one
 go, your program will suffer dramatically because of this.
 .
 Crypt::DH::GMP attempts to alleviate these problems by providing a
 Crypt::DH-compatible layer, which, instead of doing calculations via
 Math::BigInt, directly works with libgmp in C.
 .
 This means that essentially 2 call stacks worth of expensive Perl method
 calls are eliminated and also only load 1 (Crypt::DH::GMP) module instead of
 3 (Crypt::DH + Math::BigInt + Math::BigInt::GMP) is needed.
 .
 These add up to a fairly significant increase in performance.

Description: Perl library to encrypt data using ECB mode
 Crypt::ECB is a Perl-only implementation of the ECB mode. In
 combination with a block cipher such as DES, IDEA or Blowfish, you can
 encrypt and decrypt messages of arbitrarily long length. Though for
 security reasons other modes than ECB such as CBC should be preferred.
 See textbooks on cryptography if you want to know why.
 .
 The functionality of the module can be accessed via OO methods or via
 standard function calls. Remember that some crypting module like for
 example Blowfish has to be installed. The syntax follows that of
 Crypt::CBC meaning you can access Crypt::ECB exactly like Crypt::CBC,
 though Crypt::ECB is more flexible. For example you can change the key
 or the cipher without having to create a new crypt object.

Description: Perl module implementing the Eksblowfish block cipher
 Crypt::Eksblowfish provides an implementation of the Eksblowfish encryption.
 .
 Eksblowfish is a variant of the Blowfish cipher, modified to make the
 key setup very expensive.  ("Eks" stands for "expensive key schedule".)
 This doesn't make it significantly cryptographically stronger,
 but is intended to hinder brute-force attacks.  It also makes it
 unsuitable for any application requiring key agility.  It was designed
 by Niels Provos and David Mazieres for password hashing in OpenBSD.
 See Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt for the hash algorithm.
 .
 Eksblowfish is a parameterised (family-keyed) cipher.  It takes a cost
 parameter that controls how expensive the key scheduling is.  It also
 takes a family key, known as the "salt".  Cost and salt parameters
 together define a cipher family.  Within each family, a key determines an
 encryption function in the usual way.  See Crypt::Eksblowfish::Family
 for a way to encapsulate an Eksblowfish cipher family.

Description: Perl extension for one way hash chaining encryption using SHA
 This module implements a chaining block cipher using a one way hash. This
 method of encryption is the same that is used by radius (RFC2138) and is also
 described in Applied Cryptography.
 .
 Two interfaces are provided in the module. The first is straight block
 encryption/decryption the second does base64 mime encoding/decoding of the
 encrypted/decrypted blocks.
 .
 The idea is that the two sides have a shared secret that supplies one of the
 keys and a randomly generated block of bytes provides the second key. The
 random key is passed in cleartext between the two sides.
 .
 An example client and server are packaged as modules with this module. They
 are used in the tests. They can be found in the examples directory.

Description: Perl implementation of PBKDF2 password hash
 PBKDF2 (part of the PKCS#5 standard) is a secure password hashing
 algorithm that uses the techniques of "key strengthening" to make the
 complexity of a brute-force attack arbitrarily high. The Crypt::PBKDF2
 module supports SHA-1, SHA-2 and SHA-3 as the underlying hash functions
 natively and can also use arbitrary Digest-compatible classes. It
 allows for an arbitrary number of iterations of the hashing function,
 and a nearly unlimited output hash size (up to 2**32 - 1 times the size
 of the output of the backend hash). The hash is salted, as any password
 hash should be, and the salt may also be of arbitrary size.

Description: S/MIME message signing, verification, encryption and decryption module
 Crypt::SMIME provides a class for handling S/MIME messages. It can sign,
 verify, encrypt and decrypt messages.
 .
 Crypt::SMIME operates on email messages as simple strings, so there's no
 particular integration with other MAIL::* or MIME::* modules. Rather, it
 can co-operate with any module capable of accepting / outputting the entire
 message as a single string.

Description: OpenSSL support for LWP
 This perl module provides support for the HTTPS protocol under LWP, so
 that an LWP::UserAgent can make HTTPS GET & HEAD & POST requests. Please
 see perldoc LWP for more information on POST requests.
 .
 The Crypt::SSLeay package contains Net::SSL, which is automatically
 loaded by LWP::Protocol::https on HTTPS requests, and provides the
 necessary SSL glue for that module to work via these deprecated modules:
 Crypt::SSLeay::CTX, Crypt::SSLeay::Conn and Crypt::SSLeay::X509.
 .
 Work on Crypt::SSLeay has been continued only to provide HTTPS support
 for the LWP - libwww perl libraries. If you want access to the OpenSSL
 API via perl, check out Sampo's Net::SSLeay (available in Debian as
 the libnet-ssleay-perl package).

Description: lightweight Crypt/Digest convenience API
 Crypt::Util provides an easy, intuitive and forgiving API for wielding
 crypto-fu.
 .
 The API is designed as a cascade, with rich features built using
 simpler ones. This means that the option processing is uniform
 throughout, and the behaviors are generally predictable.
 .
 Note that Crypt::Util doesn't do any crypto on its own, but delegates
 the actual work to the various other crypto modules on the CPAN.
 Crypt::Util merely wraps these modules, providing uniform parameters,
 and building on top of their polymorphism with higher level features.

Description: cryptographic algorithm library for OCaml - runtime
 The Cryptokit library for Objective Caml provides a variety of
 cryptographic primitives that can be used to implement cryptographic
 protocols in security-sensitive applications.  The primitives provided
 include:
 .
   - Symmetric-key ciphers: AES, DES, Triple-DES, ARCfour,
     in ECB, CBC, CFB and OFB modes.
   - Public-key cryptography: RSA encryption, Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
   - Hash functions and MACs: SHA-1, MD5, and MACs based on AES and DES.
   - Random number generation.
   - Encodings and compression: base 64, hexadecimal, Zlib compression.
 .
 Additional ciphers and hashes can easily be used in conjunction with
 the library.  In particular, basic mechanisms such as chaining modes,
 output buffering, and padding are provided by generic classes that can
 easily be composed with user-provided ciphers.  More generally, the library
 promotes a "Lego"-like style of constructing and composing
 transformations over character streams.
 .
 This package provides just the shared library for Cryptokit.

Description: cryptographic algorithm library for OCaml - development
 The Cryptokit library for Objective Caml provides a variety of
 cryptographic primitives that can be used to implement cryptographic
 protocols in security-sensitive applications.  The primitives provided
 include:
 .
   - Symmetric-key ciphers: AES, DES, Triple-DES, ARCfour,
     in ECB, CBC, CFB and OFB modes.
   - Public-key cryptography: RSA encryption, Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
   - Hash functions and MACs: SHA-1, MD5, and MACs based on AES and DES.
   - Random number generation.
   - Encodings and compression: base 64, hexadecimal, Zlib compression.
 .
 Additional ciphers and hashes can easily be used in conjunction with
 the library.  In particular, basic mechanisms such as chaining modes,
 output buffering, and padding are provided by generic classes that can
 easily be composed with user-provided ciphers.  More generally, the library
 promotes a "Lego"-like style of constructing and composing
 transformations over character streams.
 .
 This package provides static libraries, interfaces, and documentation
 for Cryptokit.

Description: Perl extension for minifying CSS
 CSS::Minifier removes unnecessary whitespace from CSS. The primary
 requirement developing this module is to not break working stylesheets: if
 working CSS is in input then working CSS is output. The Mac/Internet Explorer
 comment hack will be minimized but not stripped and so will continue to
 function.
 .
 This module understands space, horizontal tab, new line, carriage return, and
 form feed characters to be whitespace. Any other characters that may be
 considered whitespace are not minimized. These other characters include
 paragraph separator and vertical tab.
 .
 For static CSS files, it is recommended that you minify during the build
 stage of web deployment. If you minify on-the-fly then it might be a good
 idea to cache the minified file. Minifying static files on-the-fly repeatedly
 is wasteful.

Description: simple CSS1 parser library for C++
 htmlcxx is a simple non-validating CSS1 and HTML parser for C++. Although
 there are several other html parsers available, htmlcxx has some
 characteristics that make it unique:
 .
  * STL like navigation of DOM tree, using excellent tree.hh library from
    Kasper Peeters
  * It is possible to reproduce exactly, character by character, the original
    document from the parse tree
  * Bundled CSS parser
  * Optional parsing of attributes
  * C++ code that looks like C++ (not so true anymore)
  * Offsets of tags/elements in the original document are stored in the nodes
    of the DOM tree
 .
 The parsing politics of htmlcxx were created trying to mimic Mozilla Firefox
 (http://www.mozilla.org) behavior. So you should expect parse trees similar to
 those create by Firefox. However, differently from Firefox, htmlcxx does not
 insert non-existent stuff in your html. Therefore, serializing the DOM tree
 gives exactly the same bytes contained in the original HTML document.
 .
 This package contains the C++ runtime library for CSS parsing.

Description: module to compact many CSS files into one big file
 CSS::Squish is a Perl module that takes a list of CSS files and concatenates
 them, honouring any valid @import statements included in the files, following
 the CSS 2.1 specification. Media-specific @import statements will be honoured
 by enclosing the included file in a @media rule.
 .
 Future versions may include methods to compact whitespace and other parts of
 the CSS itself, but this functionality is not yet supported.

Description: Perl module to read/write .css files with as little code as possible
 CSS::Tiny is a perl class to read and write .css stylesheets with as
 little code as possible, reducing load time and memory overhead.
 CSS.pm requires about 2.6M of memory to load, which is a large amount of
 overhead if you only want to do trivial things.
 .
 This module is primarily for reading and writing simple files, and anything
 you write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments. If you need something
 with more power, move up to CSS.pm.

Description: Simple but powerful template language for C++ - development files
 This package contains a library implementing a simple but
 powerful template language for C++.  It emphasizes separating logic
 from presentation: it is impossible to embed application logic in this
 template language.  The devel package contains static and debug
 libraries and header files for developing applications that use the
 ctemplate package.
 This package contains the ctemplate development files.

Description: HTML template engine for C++
 CTPP is a suitable choice for projects where a programmer and an HTML
 designer are different people. The goal of CTPP development was to
 achieve maximum performance with minimal basic functionality that is
 easily expandable. In other words, any conceivable capabilities can be
 added by writing users functions.
 .
 CTPP has following advantages over other template engines:
  * Very High performance as this is written in C++
  * Flexible syntax of templates
  * Robustness
  * Portability
  * Support for implementations in the language your choice
  * Various template sources
  * Output data filters
  * User functions

Description: C library to access descriptions of package upgrade problems
 libCUDF is a library to manipulate so called CUDF documents. A CUDF
 document describe an upgrade problem, as faced by package managers in
 popular package-based GNU/Linux distributions.
 .
 A CUDF document consists of a package universe and of a user request.
 The package universe describes all packages known to the package
 manager, a subset of which (the package status) denotes the package
 being currently installed on the target machine.  The user request
 denotes a change to the package status as requested by the user.
 .
 A CUDF document is naturally complemented by a solution describing
 the resulting package status (if any) implementing the user request,
 as found by a package manager.
 .
 libCUDF enables manipulation of CUDF and related documents.
 .
 This package contains a C static library binding the OCaml
 implementation of libCUDF so that it can be used from the C
 programming language.

Description: Automatic theorem prover library for SMT problems
 CVC3 is an automatic theorem prover for Satisfiability Modulo Theories
 (SMT) problems. It can be used to prove the validity (or, dually, the
 satisfiability) of first-order formulas in a large number of built-in
 logical theories and their combination.
 .
 CVC3 is the last offspring of a series of popular SMT provers, which
 originated at Stanford University with the SVC system. In particular,
 it builds on the code base of CVC Lite, its most recent
 predecessor. Its high level design follows that of the Sammy prover.
 .
 CVC3 works with a version of first-order logic with polymorphic types
 and has a wide variety of features including:
 .
   * several built-in base theories: rational and integer linear
     arithmetic, arrays, tuples, records, inductive data types, bit
     vectors, and equality over uninterpreted function symbols;
   * support for quantifiers;
   * an interactive text-based interface;
   * rich C, C++, and Java APIs for embedding in other systems;
   * proof and model generation abilities;
   * predicate subtyping;
   * essentially no limit on its use for research or commercial
     purposes (see license).
 .
 This package contains the files necessary for running applications
 that use the CVC3 library.

Description: Credential Validation Modules (shared libraries)
 CVM is a framework for validating a set of credentials against a database
 using a filter program.  The modules act as a filter, taking a set of
 credentials as input and writing a set of facts as output if those
 credentials are valid.  Optional input is given to the module through
 environment variables.
 .
 Some of the ideas for CVM came from experience with PAM (pluggable
 authentication modules), the checkpassword interface used by qmail-pop3d,
 and the "authmod" interface used by Courier IMAP and POP3.  This framework
 places fewer restrictions on the invoking client than checkpassword does,
 and is much simpler to implement on both sides than PAM and the authmod
 framework.

Description: Interface to Cyrus imap client imclient library
 The Cyrus::IMAP module provides an interface to the Cyrus imclient
 library.  These are primarily useful for implementing cyradm operations
 within a Perl script; there are easier ways to implement general client
 operations, although they may be more limited in terms of authentication
 options when talking to a Cyrus imapd.
 .
 The modules that compose Cyrus::SIEVE are also included, but they are
 undocumented upstream.
 .
 For more information, please see the cyrus-common package.

 Your Perl script just needs to set the accessors for what and how you
 want something to run and the library takes care of the rest.
 .
 You can launch programs through the shell (/usr/sbin/my_program) or
 launch Perl code itself into a daemon mode. Single and double fork
 methods are supported and in double-fork mode all the things you
 would expect like reopening STDOUT/STDERR, switching UID/GID
 are supported.

 .
  * Wrapper around fork() for correct daemonization of a process
  * Wrapper around syslog() for simple log output to syslog or STDERR
  * An API for writing PID files
  * An API for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll()
  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 .
 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It

Description: effortless web application framework
 Dancer is a Perl web application framework that aims to provide the simplest
 way for writing web applications, and offers the flexibility to scale between
 a very simple lightweight web service consisting of a few lines of code in a
 single file, all the way up to a more complex fully-fledged web application
 with session support, templates for views and layouts, etc.
 .
 If you don't want to write CGI scripts by hand, and find other frameworks
 such as Catalyst (see libcatalyst-perl) too complex or cumbersome for your
 project, Dancer is what you need.

 Dancer::Session::Cookie implements a session engine for sessions stored
 entirely in cookies. Usually only session id is stored in cookies and the
 session data itself is saved in some external storage, e.g. database. This
 module allows one to avoid using external storage at all.
 .
 Since server cannot trust any data returned by client in cookies, this module
 uses cryptography to ensure integrity and also secrecy. The data your
 application stores in sessions is completely protected from both tampering
 and analysis on the client-side.

Description: module for easy database connections for Dancer2 applications
 Dancer2::Plugin::Database Provides an easy way to obtain a connected DBI
 database handle by simply calling the database keyword within your Dancer2
 application
 .
 The module returns a Dancer::Plugin::Database::Core::Handle object, which is
 a subclass of DBI's `DBI::db' connection handle object, so it does everything
 you'd expect to do with DBI, but also adds a few convenience methods.
 .
 It takes care of ensuring that the database handle is still connected and
 valid. If the handle was last asked for more than
 `connection_check_threshold' seconds ago, it will check that the connection
 is still alive, using either the `$dbh->ping' method if the DBD driver
 supports it, or performing a simple no-op query against the database if not.
 If the connection has gone away, a new connection will be obtained and
 returned. This avoids any problems for a long-running script where the
 connection to the database might go away.
 .
 Care is taken that handles are not shared across processes/threads, so this
 should be thread-safe with no issues with transactions etc.

 With OPeNDAP software, you access data using a URL, just like a URL you
 would use to access a web page. However, before you request any data,
 you need to know how to request it in a form your browser can handle.
 OPeNDAP data is stored in binary form, and by default, it is
 transmitted that way, too.

 Data::BitMask is a Perl module to create bitmask manipulator objects
 that can be used to create bitmask values based on a list of
 constants, as well as to break apart masks using those constants. The
 advantages are that you don't have to pollute namespaces to use
 constants, you can ensure that only appropriate constants are used for
 specific masks, you can easily break apart and explain masks, and in
 general it is much easier for the user to interact with masks.

Description: Perl module for polymorphic data cloning
 Data::Clone does data cloning, i.e. copies things recursively. This is smart
 so that it works with not only non-blessed references, but also with blessed
 references (i.e. objects). When clone() finds an object, it calls a clone
 method of the object if the object has a clone, otherwise it makes a surface
 copy of the object. That is, this module does polymorphic data cloning.
 .
 Although there are several modules on CPAN which can clone data, this module
 has a different cloning policy from almost all of them.

Description: perl module to compare perl data structures recursively
 The Data::Compare module compares two perl data structures recursively,
 it natively handles several built-in data types - scalars, references
 to scalars, references to arrays, references to hashes, references
 to subroutines, compiled regular expressions, and globs. For objects, it tries
 to Do The Right Thing and compares the underlying data type.
 .
 However, this is not always what you want. This is especially true if you
 have complex objects which overload stringification and/or numification.
 So you can extend this module with your own plugins for special data
 structures, by using Data::Compare::Plugins (this is not an extra package, it
 is included here).

 Data::Dmp is a Perl dumper like Data::Dumper. It's compact (only about 150
 lines of code long), starts fast and does not use other module except
 Regexp::Stringify when dumping regexes. It produces compact output (similar
 to Data::Dumper::Concise). It roughly has the same speed as Data::Dumper
 (usually a bit faster for smaller structures), but does not offer the various
 formatting options. It supports dumping objects, regexes, circular
 structures, coderefs. Its code is based on Data::Dump.

Description: Perl module to help dump data structures
 Data::Dump provides a single function called dump that takes a list of values
 as its argument and produces a string as its result. The string contains Perl
 code that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original arguments. The
 string is formatted for easy reading.
 .
 If called in void context, the dump is printed on standard error instead of
 being returned. If you don't like importing a function that overrides Perl's
 not-so-useful builtin, then you can also import the same function as "pp"
 (the mnemonic for "pretty-print").

Description: module for serializing a data structure as Perl code
 Data::Dump::Streamer is a Perl module that serializes scalars, objects or
 reference variables and provides their contents in Perl syntax. Special data
 structures including closures, self-referential structures and objects are
 output correctly. This module is very similar in concept to the core module
 Data::Dumper, except this module is designed to output to a stream instead
 of constructing its output in memory (trading speed for memory).

Description: module for more shorter Data::Dumper-like output
 Data::Dumper::Concise is a Perl module designed to produce useful debugging
 output, eliding unnecessary information. It exists as a convenient way to
 reproduce a set of Dumper options useful for most applications.
 .
 A similar module, Data::Dump::Streamer (libdata-dump-streamer-perl) provides
 even shorter output but is overkill for most applications. In comparison,
 this module is Pure Perl, which means it is less likely to segfault.

Description: Easily dump variables together with their names (Data::Dumper-like)
 Data::Dumper::Simple allows the user to dump variables in a Data::Dumper
 format. Unlike the default behavior of Data::Dumper, the variables are named
 (instead of $VAR1, $VAR2, etc.)  Data::Dumper provides an extended
 interface that allows the programmer to name the variables, but this
 interface requires a lot of typing and is prone to tyops (sic).  This
 module fixes that.

Description: Perl module for entropy (randomness) management
 Data::Entropy maintains a concept of a current selection of entropy source.
 Algorithms that require entropy can use the source nominated by this
 module, avoiding the need for entropy source objects to be explicitly
 passed around.  This is convenient because usually one entropy source
 will be used for an entire program run and so an explicit entropy source
 parameter would rarely vary.  There is also a default entropy source,
 avoiding the need to explicitly configure a source at all.
 .
 If nothing is done to set a source then it defaults to the use of Rijndael
 (AES) in counter mode (see Data::Entropy::RawSource::CryptCounter
 and Crypt::Rijndael), keyed using Perl's built-in rand function.
 This gives a data stream that looks like concentrated entropy, but really
 only has at most the entropy of the rand seed.  Within a single run it
 is cryptographically difficult to detect the correlation between parts
 of the pseudo-entropy stream.  If more true entropy is required then it
 is necessary to configure a different entropy source.

Description: MessagePack serializing/deserializing
 Data::Messagepack converts Perl data structures to MessagePack and vice
 versa.
 .
 MessagePack is a binary-based efficient object serialization
 format. It enables to exchange structured objects between many
 languages like JSON. But unlike JSON, it is very fast and small.

Description: Help when paging through sets of results
 When searching through large amounts of data, it is often the case
 that a result set is returned that is larger than we want to display
 on one page. This results in wanting to page through various pages of
 data. The maths behind this is unfortunately fiddly, hence this
 module.
 .
 The main concept is that you pass in the number of total entries, the
 number of entries per page, and the current page number. You can then
 call methods to find out how many pages of information there are, and
 what number the first and last entries on the current page really
 are.

 it inherits from Data::Page and has access to all methods from this object.
 .
 In addition it also provides methods for dealing with set of pages, so that
 if there are too many pages you can easily break them into chunks for the
 user to browse through.
 .
 You can even choose to view page numbers in your set in a 'sliding' fassion.
 .
 The object can easily be passed to a templating system such as Template
 Toolkit or be used within a script.

Description: module providing low-level manipulation of Perl data
 Data::Peek is a module that allows for low-level manipulation of Perl data
 structures, particularly for displaying the internal representation of given
 Perl variables.
 .
 In particular, it allows one to look at a scalar value to determine whether it
 contains a string (PV), integer (IV or UV) or floating point number (NV); the
 reference count of that scalar (REFCOUNT) and other flags (such as whether the
 string is UTF-8).
 .
 This module can also create triple variables, which are similar to the dual
 variables provided by Scalar::Util - they have two or three values, and the
 value which is returned depends on the context in which it is used.

 Data::Phrasebook enables the framework for abstracting common or locale data
 out of your code into a datastore. The default is within a plain text file,
 but more complex datastores can be intrigrated via the use of other
 Data::Pharsebook::Loader distributions (eg YAML, XML, INI, DBI).

Description: Perl-based open notation for data module
 Data::Pond is concerned with representing data structures in a textual
 notation known as "Pond" (Perl-based open notation for data). The notation is
 a strict subset of Perl expression syntax, but is intended to have
 language-independent use. It is similar in spirit to JSON, which is based on
 JavaScript, but Pond represents fewer data types directly.
 .
 The data that can be represented in Pond consist of strings (of characters),
 arrays, and string-keyed hashes. Arrays and hashes can recursively (but not
 cyclically) contain any of these kinds of data. This does not cover the full
 range of data types that Perl or other languages can handle, but is intended
 to be a limited, fixed repertoire of data types that many languages can
 readily process. It is intended that more complex data can be represented
 using these basic types. The arrays and hashes provide structuring facilities
 (ordered and unordered collections, respectively), and strings are a
 convenient way to represent atomic data.

   * Human-friendly output, with array index and custom separators
   * Full object dumps including methods, inheritance and internals
   * Exposes extra information such as tainted data and weak references

Description: "split" on steroids
 Sometimes we need data split into records and a simple split on the
 input record separator (C<$/>) or some other value fails because the
 values we're splitting on may allowed in other parts of the data.
 Perhaps they're quoted. Perhaps they're embedded in other data which
 should not be split up.
 .
 Data::Record allows you to specify what you wish to split the data on,
 but also speficy an "unless" regular expression.  If the text in
 question matches the "unless" regex, it will not be split there.  This
 allows us to do things like split on newlines unless newlines are
 embedded in quotes.

 ordered.
 .
 Index strings may be used to retrieve values from array elements, or
 function references may be passed in to call on each element.
 Comparison rules are provided for numeric, bytewise, and
 case-insensitive orders, as well as a 'natural' comparison that places
 numbers first, in numeric order, followed by the remaining items in
 case-insensitive textual order.

Description: module to manipulate Structured Tags datastructures
 Data::Stag is for manipulating data as hierarchical tag/value
 pairs (Structured TAGs or Simple Tree AGgreggates). These
 datastructures can be represented as nested arrays, which have the
 advantage of being native to perl. A simple example is shown below:
 .
  [ person=> [  [ family_name => $family_name ],
  [ given_name  => $given_name  ],
  [ phone_no    => $phone_no    ] ] ],
 .
 Data::Stag uses a subset of XML for import and export. This
 means the module can also be used as a general XML parser/writer (with
 certain caveats).

Description: N at a time iteration API
 Data::Stream::Bulk is a utility for working with data streams of indefinite
 size. It tries to find a middle ground between one-at-a-time and all-at-once
 processing of data sets by providing a common interface for both.
 .
 Often, data sets from streams can fit entirely in memory, so operating on them
 with an array is simple and appropriate. However, in cases where the stream is
 not bounded, the array can grow to a very large size and quickly consume all
 available memory. This module allows developers to work with data in blocks
 which are guaranteed to fit in memory.

Description: module to manipulate data tables in perl (as in R)
 This perl package uses perl5 objects to make it easy for manipulating
 spreadsheet data among disk files, database, and Web publishing.
 .
 A table object contains a header and a two-dimensional array of scalars. Four
 class methods Data::fromFile, Data::Table::fromCSV, Data::Table::fromTSV, and
 Data::Table::fromSQL allow users to create a table object from a CSV/TSV file
 or a database SQL selection in a snap.
 .
 Table methods provide basic access, add, delete row(s) or column(s)
 operations, as well as more advanced sub-table extraction, table sorting,
 record matching via keywords or patterns, table merging, and web publishing.
 Data::Table class also provides a straightforward interface to other popular
 Perl modules such as DBI and GD::Graph.

Description: Object-oriented interface to Data::TreeDumper
 The Data::TreeDumper::OO Perl module provides an object-oriented
 interface for displaying Perl data structures and objects in
 a format that is hopefully easier to read than the one produced by
 the standard Perl Data::Dumper module.

Description: globally/universally unique identifiers (GUIDs/UUIDs)
 Data::UUID provides a framework for generating v3 UUIDs (Universally
 Unique Identifiers, also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers).
 A UUID is 128 bits long, and is guaranteed to be different from all
 other UUIDs/GUIDs generated until 3400 CE.
 .
 UUIDs were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) and
 later in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing
 Environment.  Currently many different technologies rely on UUIDs to
 provide unique identity for various software components. Microsoft
 COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDs very extensively to uniquely identify
 classes, applications and components across network-connected systems.
 .
 The algorithm for UUID generation, used by this extension, is described
 in the Internet Draft "UUIDs and GUIDs" by Paul J. Leach and Rich Salz.
 (See RFC 4122.)  It provides reasonably efficient and reliable
 framework for generating UUIDs and supports fairly high allocation
 rates -- 10 million per second per machine -- and therefore is suitable
 for identifying both extremely short-lived and very persistent objects
 on a given system as well as across the network.

Description: Easy YAML serialisation of Perl data structures
 In the spirit of YAML::Tiny, Data::YAML::Reader and Data::YAML::Writer
 provide lightweight, dependency-free YAML handling. While YAML::Tiny is
 designed principally for working with configuration files Data::YAML
 concentrates on the transparent round-tripping of YAML serialized Perl data
 structures.
 .
 As an example of why this distinction matters consider that YAML::Tiny
 doesn't handle hashes with keys containing non-printable characters. This is
 fine for configuration files but likely to cause problems when handling
 arbitrary Perl data structures. Data::YAML handles exotic hash keys
 correctly.
 .
 The syntax accepted by Data::YAML is a subset of YAML. Specifically it is the
 same subset of YAML that Data::YAML::Writer produces. See Data::YAML for more
 information.

Description: Perl library for accessing dates
 Date::Calc is a Perl module which provides a variety of date calculations
 based on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in Western countries today),
 complying with the ISO/R 2015-1971 and DIN 1355 standards which specify
 things such as what leap years are, when they occur, how the week numbers
 are defined, what's the first day of the week, how many weeks (52 or 53) a
 given year has, and so on.
 .
 Although the Gregorian calendar was only adopted 1582 by most (not all)
 European countries (some countries continued to use the Julian calendar
 until as late as the beginning of the 20th century!), this package allows
 you to extrapolate the Gregorian calendar back until the year 1.
 .
 If Date::Calc::XS (libdate-calc-xs-perl) is available, this package will
 automatically accelerate its operation using the C/XS implementation.

Description: Perl handling of the three ISO 8601 numerical calendars
 The international standard ISO 8601 "Data elements and interchange formats -
 Information interchange - Representation of dates and times" defines three
 distinct calendars by which days can be labelled. It also defines textual
 formats for the representation of dates in these calendars. Date::ISO8601
 provides functions to convert dates between these three calendars and
 Chronological Julian Day Numbers, which is a suitable format to do arithmetic
 with. It also supplies functions that describe the shape of these calendars,
 to assist in calendrical calculations. It also supplies functions to
 represent dates textually in the ISO 8601 formats. ISO 8601 also covers time
 of day and time periods, but this module does nothing relating to those parts
 of the standard; this is only about labelling days.
 .
 The first ISO 8601 calendar divides time up into years, months, and days. It
 corresponds exactly to the Gregorian calendar, invented by Aloysius Lilius
 and promulgated by Pope Gregory XIII in the late sixteenth century, with AD
 (CE) year numbering. This calendar is applied to all time, not just to dates
 after its invention nor just to years 1 and later. Thus for ancient dates it
 is the proleptic Gregorian calendar with astronomical year numbering.

Description: conversion between flavours of Julian Date
 For date and time calculations it is convenient to represent dates by a
 simple linear count of days, rather than in a particular calendar. This is
 such a good idea that it has been invented several times. If there were a
 single such linear count then it would be the obvious data interchange format
 between calendar modules. With several versions, calendar modules can use
 such sensible data formats and still have interoperability problems. Date::JD
 tackles that problem, by performing conversions between different flavours of
 day count. These day count systems are generically known as "Julian Dates",
 after the most venerable of them.
 .
 Among Julian Date systems there are also some non-trivial differences of
 concept. There are systems that count only complete days, and those that
 count fractional days also. There are some that are fixed to Universal Time
 (time on the prime meridian), and others that are interpreted according to a
 timezone. Some consider the day to start at noon and others at midnight,
 which is semantically significant for the complete-day counts. The functions
 of this module appropriately handle the semantics of all the non-trivial
 conversions.

 that can do a small subset of these operations quicker, so if speed is a
 primary issue, you should look elsewhere.

Description: abstraction layer for DateTime over some database vendors
 DateTime::Format::DBI finds a DateTime::Format::* class that is suitable for
 the use with a given DBI connection (and DBD::* driver).
 .
 It currently supports the following format modules: IBM DB2
 (DB2)|DateTime::Format::DB2, MySQL|DateTime::Format::MySQL,
 Oracle|DateTime::Format::Oracle, PostgreSQL (Pg)|DateTime::Format::Pg,
 SQLite|DateTime::Format::SQLite.
 .
 NOTE: This module provides a quick method to find the correct parser and
 formatter class. However, this is usually not sufficient for full database
 abstraction. You will also have to cater for differences in the syntax and
 semantics of SQL datetime functions (and other SQL commands).

Description: module for parsing and formatting Oracle dates and timestamps
 DateTime::Format::Oracle may be used to convert Oracle date and timestamp
 values into DateTime objects. It also can take a DateTime object and produce
 a date string matching the NLS_DATE_FORMAT.
 .
 Oracle has flexible date formatting via its NLS_DATE_FORMAT session variable.
 Date values will be returned from Oracle according to the current value of
 that variable. Date values going into Oracle must also match the current
 setting of NLS_DATE_FORMAT.
 .
 Timestamp values will match either the NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT or
 NLS_TIMESTAMP_TZ_FORMAT session variables.
 .
 This module keeps track of these Oracle session variable values by examining
 environment variables of the same name. Each time one of Oracle's formatting
 session variables is updated, the %ENV hash must also be updated.

Description: module for manipulating dates, times and timestamps
 DateTime is a Perl module which aims to provide a complete, correct, and easy
 to use date/time object implementation. It provides an easy way to manipulate
 dates and times, including date calculations (even addition and subtraction)
 and provides convenient methods for extracting or modifying portions of any
 date or time.
 .
 This module supports the Olson time zone database, meaning that historical
 time zone information, and more importantly, daylight saving time rules, can
 be handled transparently, simply by setting the correct time zone. This is
 done by using the DateTime::TimeZone module.

Description: Datetime sets and set math
 DateTime::Set is a module for date/time sets.  It can be used to
 handle two different types of sets.
 .
 The first is a fixed set of predefined datetime objects.  For example,
 to create a set of dates containing the birthdays of people in a family.
 .
 The second type of set that it can handle is one based on the idea of
 a recurrence, such as "every Wednesday", or "noon on the 15th day of
 every month".  This type of set can have fixed starting and ending
 datetimes, but neither is required.  So "every Wednesday set"
 could be "every Wednesday from the beginning of time until the end of
 time", or "every Wednesday after 2003-03-05 until the end of time", or
 "every Wednesday between 2003-03-05 and 2004-01-07".

 Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method with
 O(1) time complexity for searching. Comparably as efficient as hashing,
 trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and key spelling
 manipulation. This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers, as well as
 spelling dictionaries.
 .
 This library is an implementation of double-array structure for representing
 trie, as proposed by Junichi Aoe. The details of the implementation can be
 found at http://linux.thai.net/~thep/datrie/datrie.html
 .
 This package contains the development libraries, header files and manpages
 you need to develop your programs using the datrie library.

Description: Documentation files for double-array trie library
 Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method with
 O(1) time complexity for searching. Comparably as efficient as hashing,
 trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and key spelling
 manipulation. This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers, as well as
 spelling dictionaries.
 .
 This library is an implementation of double-array structure for representing
 trie, as proposed by Junichi Aoe. The details of the implementation can be
 found at http://linux.thai.net/~thep/datrie/datrie.html
 .
 This package contains some documents about the datrie library.

 Berkeley DB, Oracle Berkeley DB Java Edition executes in the address
 space of the application, without the overhead of client/server
 communication. It stores data in the application's native format, so
 no runtime data translation is required. It provides an easy-to-use,
 programmatic interface, allowing developers to store and retrieve
 information quickly, simply and reliably.

Description: Berkeley database routines [glibc 2.0/2.1 compatibility]
 libdb is a library for manipulating database files, developed at Berkeley.
 .
 It supports three kinds of file formats:
  * btree. A representation of a sorted, balanced tree structure.
  * hashed. An extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.
  * UNIX file oriented. A byte stream file with fixed or variable length
    records.
 .
 This library exists for compatibility with applications built against
 glibc 2.0 or 2.1. There is intentionally no corresponding development
 package. Do not link new applications against this library!

Description: perl DBI driver for files and data structures
 DBD::AnyData allows you to import almost any type of Perl data structure
 into an in-memory table and then use DBI and SQL to access and modify
 it.  It also allows standard database access to almost any kind of file,
 supporting SQL manipulation of the file without converting the file
 out of its native format.
 .
 The module allows you to prototype a database without having
 an RDBMS system or other database engine and can operate either with or
 without creating or reading disk files.  If you do use disk files,
 they may, in most cases, either be local files or any remote file
 accessible via HTTP or FTP.
 .
 The module also supports converting files between any of the supported formats.

Description: Perl extension for LDAP access via an SQL/Perl DBI interface
 DBD::LDAP is a DBI extension module adding an SQL database interface to
 standard LDAP databases to Perl's database-independent database interface.
 You will need access to an existing LDAP database or set up your own using
 an LDAP server, ie. "OpenLDAP", see (http://www.openldap.org).
 .
 The main advantage of DBD::LDAP is the ability to query LDAP databases via
 standard SQL queries in leu of cryptic LDAP "filters".  LDAP is optimized for
 quick lookup of existing data, but DBD::LDAP does support entry inserts,
 updates, and deletes with commit/rollback via the standard SQL commands!

Description: Mock database driver for testing
 Testing with databases can be tricky. If you are developing a system married
 to a single database then you can make some assumptions about your
 environment and ask the user to provide relevant connection information. But
 if you need to test a framework that uses DBI, particularly a framework that
 uses different types of persistence schemes, then it may be more useful to
 simply verify what the framework is trying to do -- ensure the right SQL is
 generated and that the correct parameters are bound. DBD::Mock makes it easy
 to just modify your configuration (presumably held outside your code) and
 just use it instead of DBD::Foo (like DBD::Pg or DBD::mysql) in your
 framework.

 programming language and the MySQL programming API that comes with the
 MariaDB/MySQL relational database management system. Most functions provided by
 this programming API are supported. Some rarely used functions are
 missing, mainly because no one ever requested them. However supported
 features include: compression of data between server and client; timeouts;
 SSL; prepared statement support; server administration such as creating
 and dropping databases and restarting the server; auto-reconnection;
 utf8; bind type guessing; bind comment placeholders; automated insert ids;
 transactions; multiple result sets and multithreading.

Description: Perl DBI driver with a self-contained RDBMS (SQLite2 version)
 The DBD::SQLite2 module embeds a small fast embedded SQL database engine
 called SQLite into a DBI driver, if you want a relational database for your
 project, but don't want to install a large RDBMS system like MySQL or
 PostgreSQL, then DBD::SQLite may be just what you need.
 .
 SQLite supports the following features:
 .
  * Implements a large subset of SQL92
    See http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/lang.html for details.
 .
  * A complete DB in a single disk file
    Everything for your database is stored in a single disk file, making it
    easier to move things around than with DBD::CSV.
 .
  * Atomic commit and rollback
 .
 The engine is very fast, but for updates/inserts/dml it does perform
 a global lock on the entire database.  This, obviously, might not be
 good for multiple user systems.  So beware.  The database also
 appears to be significantly faster if your transactions are coarse.

Description: Perl Database Interface (DBI)
 DBI (DataBase Interface) is a Perl framework that provides a common interface
 to access various backend databases in a uniform manner. DBD (DataBase Driver)
 modules provide implementations for various backend data storage mechanisms
 including networked relational databases (particularly SQL databases) and even
 web services such as the Google search engine.
 .
 It is extremely portable and available for a wide range of operating systems,
 architectures and data stores, including:
 .
  * Oracle
  * Microsoft SQL Server
  * IBM DB2
  * SQLite
  * PostgreSQL
  * Firebird
  * MySQL

Description: test suite for the DBI API
 DBI::Test aims to be a test suite for the DBI API and an underlying DBD
 driver, to check if the provided functionality is working and complete.
 .
 Part of this module is the ability for self-testing using DBI::Mock. This is
 not designed to be another DBI::PurePerl - it's designed to allow tests can
 be verified to work as expected in a sandbox. This is, of course, limited to
 DBI API itself and cannot load any driver nor really execute any action.

Description: DBI SQL abstraction
 DBIX::Abstract provides methods for retrieving and storing data in SQL
 databases.  It provides methods for all of the more important SQL
 commands (like SELECT, INSERT, REPLACE, UPDATE, DELETE).
 .
 It endeavors to produce an interface that will be intuitive to those
 already familiar with SQL.
 .
 Notable features include:
  * data_source generation for some DBD drivers.
  * Can check to make sure the connection is not stale and reconnect if
    it is.
  * Controls statement handles for you.
  * Can delay writes.
  * Generates complex where clauses from hashes and arrays.
  * Shortcuts (convenience functions) for some common cases.
    (Like select_all_to_hashref.)

Description: Optimistic locking support for DBIx::Class
 Optimistic locking is an alternative to using exclusive locks when you
 have the possibility of concurrent, conflicting updates in your database.
 The basic principle is you allow any and all clients to issue updates and
 rather than preemptively synchronizing all data  modifications (which is
 what happens with exclusive locks) you are "optimistic" that updates won't
 interfere with one another and the updates will only fail when they do
 in fact interfere with one another.

Description: extensible and flexible object <-> relational mapper
 DBIx::Class is an SQL to OO mapper with an object API inspired by Class::DBI
 (and a compatibility layer as a springboard for porting) and a resultset API
 that allows abstract encapsulation of database operations. It aims to make
 representing queries in your code as perl-ish as possible while still
 providing access to as many of the capabilities of the database as possible,
 including retrieving related records from multiple tables in a single query,
 JOIN, LEFT JOIN, COUNT, DISTINCT, GROUP BY and HAVING support.
 .
 DBIx::Class can handle multi-column primary and foreign keys, complex queries
 and database-level paging, and does its best to only query the database in
 order to return something you've directly asked for. If a resultset is used
 as an iterator it only fetches rows off the statement handle as requested
 in order to minimise memory usage. It has auto-increment support for SQLite,
 MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server and DB2 and is known to be used in
 production on at least the first four, and is fork- and thread-safe out of
 the box (although your DBD may not be).

Description: module to automate definition of a DBIx::Class::Schema
 DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader is an extension to DBIx::Class that automates the
 definition of a DBIx::Class::Schema by scanning table schemas and setting up
 columns and primary keys appropriately. It supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
 and DB2.
 .
 Bare table definitions are fairly straightforward, but relationship creation
 is somewhat heuristic, especially with respect to choosing relationship types
 and names, as well as join types. The relationships generated by this module
 will probably never be as well-defined as hand-generated ones.

Description: module to add context aware fetches to DBI
 The Perl database independent interface - DBI - does not take much
 advantage of Perl's context sensitivity. This is the situation where
 a Perl subroutine knows whether the caller wants a single scalar
 value or a list of them to be returned.
 .
 DBIx::ContextualFetch is a sub-class of DBI which redefines some of
 the various fetch methods to fix this oversight. It also adds a few
 new methods for convenience (though not necessarily efficiency). Much
 of this code was originally part of the IMA::DBI Perl module
 (libima-dbi-perl package).

Description: module providing relational database to hierarchical mapping
 The module DBIx::DBStag is for mapping from databases to Stag objects
 (Structured Tags - see the Data::Stag manpage), which can also be
  represented as XML. It has two main uses:
 .
 Querying
   This module can take the results of any SQL query and decompose the
   flattened results into a tree data structure which reflects the
   foreign keys in the underlying relational schema. It does this by
   looking at the SQL query and introspecting the database schema,
   rather than requiring metadata or an object model.
 .
   In this respect, the module works just like a regular the DBI
   manpage handle, with some extra methods provided.
 .
 Storing Data
   DBStag objects can store any tree-like datastructure (such as XML
   documents) into a database using normalized schema that reflects the
   structure of the tree being stored. This is done using little or no
   metadata.
 .
   XML can also be imported, and a relational schema automatically
   generated.

Description: Indexing documents with MySQL as storage
 DBIx::FullTextSearch is a flexible solution for indexing contents of documents.
 It uses the MySQL database to store the information about words and
 documents and provides Perl interface for indexing new documents,
 making changes and searching for matches.  For DBIx::FullTextSearch, a document
 is nearly anything -- Perl scalar, file, Web document, database field.
 .
 The basic style of interface is shown above. What you need is a MySQL
 database and a DBI with DBD::mysql. Then you create a DBIx::FullTextSearch
 index  -- a set of tables that maintain all necessary information. Once created
 it can be accessed many times, either for updating the index (adding
 documents) or searching.
 .
 DBIx::FullTextSearch uses one basic table to store parameters of the index.
 Second table is used to store the actual information about documents and words,
 and depending on the type of the index (specified during index creation)
 there may be more tables to store additional information (like
 conversion from external string names (eg. URL's) to internal numeric
 form). For a user, these internal thingies and internal behaviour of the
 index are not important. The important part is the API, the methods to
 index document and ask questions about words in documents. However,
 certain understanding of how it all works may be useful when you are
 deciding if this module is for you and what type of index will best
 suit your needs.

Description: module to detect what database code is connected to
 DBIx::Introspector is a module factored out of the DBIx::Class database
 detection code. Most code that needs to detect which database it is connected
 to assumes that there is a one-to-one mapping from database drivers to
 database engines. Unfortunately reality is rarely that simple. For instance,
 DBD::ODBC is typically used to connect to SQL Server, but ODBC can be used to
 connect to PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle. Additionally, while ODBC is the
 most common way to connect to SQL Server, it is not the only option, as
 DBD::ADO can also be used.
 .
 DBIx::Introspector can correctly detect which database you are connected to,
 because it was factored out of a complex, working codebase. On top of that it
 has been written to be very extensible. So if you needed to detect which
 version of your given database you are connected to that would not be
 difficult.

 DBIx::Profile is a quick and easy, and mostly transparent, profiler
 for scripts using DBI.  It collects information on the query
 level, and keeps track of first, failed, normal, and total amounts
 (count, wall clock, CPU time) for each function on the query.
 .
 NOTE: DBIx::Profile use Time::HiRes to clock the wall time and
       the old standby times() to clock the CPU time.  The CPU time is
       pretty coarse.
 .
 DBIx::Profile can also trace the execution of queries.  It will print
 a timestamp and the query that was called.  This is optional, and
 occurs only when the environment variable DBIXPROFILETRACE is set
 to 1. (ex: (bash) export DBIXPROFILETRACE=1).

Description: Perl extension for DBI recordsets
 DBIx::Recordset is a perl module for abstraction and simplification of
 database access.
 .
 The goal is to make standard database access (select/insert/update/delete)
 easier to handle and independent of the underlying DBMS. Special attention is
 made on web applications to make it possible to handle the state-less access
 and to process the posted data of form fields, but DBIx::Recordset is not
 limited to web applications.
 .
 DBIx::Recordset uses the DBI API to access the database, so it should
 work with every database for which a DBD driver is available (see
 also DBIx::Compat).
 .
 Most public functions take a hash reference as parameter, which makes
 it simple to supply various different arguments to the same
 function. The parameter hash can also be taken from a hash containing
 posted form fields like those available with CGI.pm, mod_perl,
 HTML::Embperl and others.

Description: safe wrapper to DBI interface
 The purpose of the DBIx::Safe module is to give controlled, limited access to
 an application, rather than simply passing it a raw database handle through
 DBI. DBIx::Safe acts as a wrapper to the database, by only allowing through
 the commands you tell it to. It filters all things related to the database
 handle - methods and attributes.
 .
 The typical usage is for your application to create a database handle via a
 normal DBI call to new(), then pass that to DBIx::Safe->new(), which will
 return you a DBIx::Safe object. After specifying exactly what is and what is
 not allowed, you can pass the object to the untrusted application. The object
 will act very similar to a DBI database handle, and in most cases can be used
 interchangeably.
 .
 By default, nothing is allowed to run at all. There are many things you can
 control. You can specify which SQL commands are allowed, by indicating the
 first word in the SQL statement (e.g. 'SELECT'). You can specify which
 database methods are allowed to run (e.g. 'ping'). You can specify a regular
 expression that allows matching SQL statements to run (e.g. 'qr{SET
 TIMEZONE}'). You can specify a regular expression that is NOT allowed to run
 (e.g. qr(UPDATE xxx}). Finally, you can indicate which database attributes
 are allowed to be read and changed (e.g. 'PrintError'). For all of the above,
 there are matching methods to remove them as well.

 DBIx::Simple provides a simplified interface to DBI, Perl's powerful de-facto
 standard database interface. This module is aimed at rapid development and
 easy maintenance of your codebase. A single method prepares and executes your
 queries, and the result object (which wraps the statement handle) provides
 easy row-by-row iteration and slurping methods.
 .
 The query method returns either a result object, or a dummy object. The dummy
 object returns undef (or an empty list) for all methods and when evaluated in
 boolean context, is false. The dummy object lets you postpone (or skip) error
 checking, but it also makes immediate error checking simple.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (library)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

 with existing bindings (which wrap libdbus).
 .
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between
 applications.  Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets
 and CORBA in terms of complexity.
 .
 This package contains development files for dbus-sharp, and should be
 used for compilation.

Description: Perl module to match delimited substrings
 DelimMatch allows you to match delimited substrings in a buffer. The
 delimiters can be specified with any regular expression and the start
 and end delimiters need not be the same. If the delimited text is
 properly nested, entire nested groups are returned.
 .
 In addition, you may specify quoting and escaping characters that
 contribute to the recognition of start and end delimiters.

Description: Dependency Extraction and Processing System
 Toolkit to extract internal dependencies from a project, manipulate
 the dependency graph in arbitrary ways, and produce graphs to help in
 managing your project, including locating abusive #includes.
 .
 It aims to be fully generic and pluggable, but is still under
 development.  However, several aspects are already possible to
 customize.  Eg, you can provide your own graph transformations,
 styling rules, and graph renderers.

Description: Apache Derby Database Engine and Embedded JDBC Driver
 Apache Derby is an open source relational database implemented entirely
 in Java.
  * Derby has a small footprint -- about 2.6 megabytes for the base engine and
    embedded JDBC driver.
  * Derby is based on the Java, JDBC, and SQL standards.
  * Derby provides an embedded JDBC driver that lets you embed Derby in any
    Java-based solution.
  * Derby also supports the more familiar client/server mode with the Derby
    Network Client JDBC driver and Derby Network Server.
  * Derby is easy to install, deploy, and use.
 .
 This package includes the database server, the embedded JDBC driver and
 localisations.

 The Derby network client provides network connectivity to the Derby Network
 Server. It is distributed as an additional jar file, derbyclient.jar, with an
 entirely independent code base from the embedded driver.
 .
 The Derby network client is a type 4, JDBC compliant Driver, which attempts
 to match the Derby Embedded JDBC driver as much as possible.
 .
 The Derby Network Server is provided by the derby-core package.

Description: Perl module which communicates with the Desktop Notifications framework
 This module provides a Perl interface to the Desktop Notifications framework.
 .
 The framework allows applications to display pop-up notifications on an X
 desktop.  This is implemented with two components: a daemon that displays the
 notifications, and a client library used by applications to send notifications
 to the daemon.  These components communicate through the DBus message bus
 protocol.
 .
 This module serves the same purpose as libnotify, in an object-oriented Perl
 interface.  It is not, however, an interface to libnotify itself, but a
 separate implementation of the specification using Net::DBus.

 DES-SERT is a framework written as ANSI-C library. While generally
 usable in many application scenarios, it is primarily used in DES-Mesh,
 the multi-transceiver wireless mesh network testbed part of the
 DES-Testbed. DES-SERT enables the implementation of routing protocols
 via an underlay in user space.
 .
 DES-SERT routing daemons utilize libpcap to receive packets from the
 network resp. to send them. Locally generated packets or packets destined
 to this host use a TUN or TAP interface as access point to the operating

Description: module for setting autoflush from the command line
 Devel::Autoflush is a hack to set autoflush for STDOUT and STDERR from the
 command line or from "PERL5OPT" for code that needs it but doesn't have it.
 .
 This often happens when prompting:
 .
   # guess.pl
   print "Guess a number: ";
   $n = <STDIN>;
 .
 As long as the output is going to a terminal, the prompt is flushed when STDIN
 is read.  However, if the output is being piped, the print statement will
 not automatically be flushed, no prompt will be seen and the program will
 silently appear to hang while waiting for input.

 allows XS code to attach a magical annotation to a Perl subroutine,
 resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine being mutated at
 compile time by arbitrary C code.  This module makes
 cv_set_call_checker and several supporting functions available.  (It is
 possible to achieve the effect of cv_set_call_checker from XS code on
 much earlier Perl versions, but it is painful to achieve without the
 centralised facility.)

Description: Perl module to get caller return OP address and Perl interpreter context
 Devel::Callsite module provides subroutines to get the caller return OP
 address and perl interpreter context.
 .
 The callsite() function returns the OP address of the caller, a number,
 one level up from where it was called. It's useful for functions that
 need to uniquely know where they were called, such as Every::every();
 see Every. Or it can be used to pinpoint a location with finer
 granularity than a line number (see
 http://www.perlmonks.com/?node_id=987268). In conjunction with an OP
 tree disassembly you can know exactly where the caller is located in
 the Perl source.
 .
 The context() function returns the interpreter context as a number.
 This is a fairly unique number together with the call site.

Description: module for checking the availability of a library
 Devel::CheckLib is a perl module that checks whether a particular C library
 and its headers are available.
 .
 It works by trying to compile some code and linking it to the specified
 libraries. If something pops out the end which looks executable, it gets
 executed. That tiny program is built once for each specified library, and
 (without linking) once for each header file.
 .
 It is also possible to check for the presence of particular functions in a
 library, or even that those functions return particular results.

Description: module to include stack traces on all warnings and errors
 Devel::Confess is meant as a debugging aid. It can be used to make a script
 complain loudly with stack backtraces when warn()ing or die()ing. Unlike
 other similar modules (e.g. Carp::Always), it includes stack traces even when
 exception objects are thrown.
 .
 The stack traces are generated using Carp, and will work for all types of
 errors. Carp's "carp" and "confess" functions will also be made to include
 stack traces.

Description: Perl tool for determining code coverage metrics
 Devel::Cover is a Perl module that helps collect and display code coverage
 information. Code coverage information is collected using a pluggable runops
 function which counts how many times each op is executed. This data is then
 mapped back to reality using the B compiler modules. There is also a another
 statement profiler which needs a better backend to be really useful.
 .
 Statement, branch, condition, subroutine, pod and time coverage information is
 reported. Statement coverage data should be reasonable, although there may be
 some statements which are not reported. Branch and condition coverage data
 should be mostly accurate too, although not always what one might initially
 expect. Subroutine coverage should be as accurate as statement coverage. Pod
 coverage comes from Pod::Coverage. If Pod::Coverage::CountParents is available
 it will be used instead. Coverage data for path coverage are not yet
 collected.
 .
 The cover program can be used to generate coverage reports. Another included
 program, gcov2perl, can convert gcov files to Devel::Cover databases.

 This module can be used for adding new keywords, completely in Perl code. It
 allows a subroutine to be executed during the Perl code compilation, meaning
 that syntax can be transformed into equivalent code for Perl on-the-fly.

 information can also be used to create an execution graph of the script,
 showing subroutine relationships.
 .
 Devel::DProf is deprecated. It is recommended that you install and use
 Devel::NYTProf (in the package libdevel-nytprof-perl) instead, as it
 offers significantly improved profiling and reporting.

Description: simple, extensible Perl debugger
 Devel::ebug is a simple and extensible Perl debugger with a clean API.
 Using this module, you may easily write a Perl debugger to debug your
 programs. Alternatively, it comes with an interactive debugger, ebug.
 .
 Perl's current debugger is currently 2,600 lines of magic and special cases.
 The code is nearly unreadable: fixing bugs and adding new features is fraught
 with difficulties. The debugger has no test suite which has caused breakage
 with changes that couldn't be properly tested. It will also not debug regexes.
 Devel::ebug is aimed at fixing these problems and delivering a replacement
 debugger which provides a well-tested simple programmatic interface to
 debugging programs. This makes it easier to build debuggers on top of
 Devel::ebug, be they console-, curses-, GUI- or Ajax-based.

Description: module to open and communicate with a gdb session
 The Devel::GDB package provides an interface for communicating
 with GDB. Internally, it uses the GDB/MI interpreter
 (see http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_25.html),
 which accurately informs the caller of the program state and,
 through the use of tokens, guarantees that the results returned
 actually correspond to the request sent.
 By contrast, GDB's console interpreter returns all responses on
 STDOUT, and thus there is no way to ensure that a particular response
 corresponds to a particular request.
 .
 Therefore, it is obviously preferable to use GDB/MI when programmatically
 interacting with GDB.  This can be done via the send_cmd family of functions
 (send_cmd, send_cmd_excl, and send_cmd_async).  There are, however,
 some cases when there is no GDB/MI command corresponding to a particular
 console command, or it has not yet been implemented (for example, -symbol-type,
 corresponding to the console command ptype, is not yet implemented as of GDB
 6.6).  In this case, the get function provides a workaround by capturing all
 output sent to the console stream.

Description: Perl statement and subroutine code profiler
 Devel::NYTProf is a powerful feature-rich perl source code profiler.
 .
  * Performs per-line statement profiling for fine detail
  * Performs per-subroutine statement profiling for overview
  * Performs per-block statement profiling (the first profiler to do so)
  * Accounts correctly for time spent after calls return
  * Performs inclusive and exclusive timing of subroutines
  * Subroutine times are per calling location (a powerful feature)
  * Can profile compile-time activity, just run-time, or just END time
  * Uses novel techniques for efficient profiling
  * Sub-microsecond (100ns) resolution on systems with clock_gettime()
  * Very fast - the fastest statement and subroutine profilers for
    perl
  * Handles applications that fork, with no performance cost
  * Immune from noise caused by profiling overheads and I/O
  * Program being profiled can stop/start the profiler
  * Generates richly annotated and cross-linked html reports
  * Trivial to use with mod_perl - add one line to httpd.conf
  * Includes an extensive test suite
  * Tested on very large codebases
 .
 NYTProf is effectively two profilers in one: a statement profiler, and a
 subroutine profiler.
 .
 NYTProf stands for 'New York Times Profiler'. Indeed, this module was
 initially developed from Devel::FastProf by The New York Times Co. to help
 their developers quickly identify bottlenecks in large Perl applications.

Description: Perl module to dump subroutine parameters concisely
 Devel::PartialDump is similar in nature to Data::Dumper, however, it is
 optimized for the common case of bug reporting with complex data structures.
 Outputting a string containing a complex data structure can yield rather
 useless results, since the structures are stringified.
 .
 This module optionally overrides Carp's routines to provide a concise dump of
 a variable's contents instead of a simple stringification with warn, etc.

Description: Perl module to obtain the reference count of a variable
 Devel::Refcount provides a single function which obtains the reference count
 of the object being pointed to by the passed reference value.
 .
 Internally, Perl maintains a count of the number of 'things' referring to each
 variable, as a means of providing automatic memory management. Every time a
 reference is made to a scalar value, for example, the reference count is
 incremented; every time that reference is lost (eg. when a lexical variable
 goes out of scope) then the reference count is decremented.

Description: CD Input and control library
 Device::Cdio is a interface to the GNU CD Input and Control library (libcdio)
 and it's ISO 9660 library (libiso9660) which are written in C. The library
 encapsulates CD-ROM reading and control and ISO 9660 handling. Perl programs
 wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and device-dependent properties of a
 CD-ROM can use this library.

Description: RFC 2229 compliant modular dictionary server (shared library)
 GNU Dico is an implementation of the DICT protocol as defined in RFC 2229.
 It is fully modular: the daemon itself (dicod) provides only the server
 functionality, and knows nothing about database formats. Actual searches
 are performed by functions supplied in loadable modules. A single module
 can serve one or more databases.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: OFFIS DICOM Viewer (JNI files)
 DICOMscope is a free DICOM viewer which can display uncompressed, monochrome
 DICOM images from all modalities and which supports monitor calibration
 according to DICOM part 14 as well as presentation states.
 .
 DICOMscope offers a print client (DICOM Basic Grayscale Print Management)
 which also implements the optional Presentation LUT SOP Class.
 .
 The development of this prototype was commissioned by the "Committee for the
 Advancement of DICOM" and demonstrated at the European Congress of Radiology
 ECR 1999. An enhanced version was developed for the "DICOM Display Consistency
 Demonstration" at RSNA InfoRAD 1999.
 .
 The current release has been demonstrated at ECR 2001 and contains numerous
 extensions, including a print server, support for encrypted DICOM
 communication, digital signatures and structured reporting.
 .
 This package contains the architecture dependent JNI files.

Description: Random-number generator test library -- development package
 libdieharder is the core library of dieharder and friends, designed to
 be "the last suite of random number testers you'll ever wear".  It can
 test any of its many prebuilt and library linked generators (basically
 all of those in the GNU Scientific Library plus a number of others from
 various sources) or a potentially random dataset in either an
 ascii-formatted or raw (presumed 32 bit uint) binary file.  It is fairly
 straightforward to wrap new software generators for testing, or to add
 hardware generators that have a software interface for testing, and the
 file input method permits pretty much any software or hardware RNG to be
 tested using libdieharder calls.
 .
 libdieharder has as a design goal the full encapsulation in an
 extensible shell of basically all the random number tests I have been
 able to find -- George Marsaglia's "diehard" battery of tests, STS
 (v1.6) from NIST FIPS, Knuth's tests, and more.  Check in the man
 page(s) or /usr/share/dieharder*/dieharder.pdf for documentation.
 .
 This package provides the header files and the pdf manual.
