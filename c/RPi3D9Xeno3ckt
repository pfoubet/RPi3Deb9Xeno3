Description: Perl module for OATH One Time Passwords
 Authen::OATH is an implementation of the HOTP and TOTP One Time Password
 algorithms as defined by OATH (http://www.openauthentication.org).
 .
 All necessary parameters are set by default, though these can be overridden.
 Both totp() and htop() have passed all of the test vectors defined in the RFC
 documents for TOTP and HOTP.
 .
 totp() and hotp() both default to returning 6 digits and using SHA. As such,
 both can be called by passing only the secret key and a valid OTP will be
 returned.

Description: Perl module encapsulating hashed passwords/passphrases as objects
 Authen::Passphrase is the base class for a system of objects that encapsulate
 passphrases.  An object of this type is a passphrase recogniser: its
 job is to recognise whether an offered passphrase is the right one.
 For security, such passphrase recognisers usually do not themselves know
 the passphrase they are looking for; they can merely recognise it when
 they see it.  There are many schemes in use to achieve this effect,
 and the intent of this class is to provide a consistent interface to
 them all, hiding the details.
 .
 This package contains implementations of several specific passphrase schemes
 in addition to the base class.

Description: Authen::SASL - SASL Authentication framework
 SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network
 protocols. Authen::SASL provides an implementation framework that all
 protocols should be able to share.
 .
 The framework allows different implementations of the connection class
 to be plugged in. At the time of writing there were two such plugins:
  - Authen::SASL::Perl
    This module implements several mechanisms and is implemented
    entirely in Perl.
  - Authen::SASL::Cyrus
    This module uses the Cyrus SASL C-library (both version 1 and 2 are
    supported).

 team projects. The team would designate a URI to represent the team as a

 stamped with the authority of the team using:
 .
        use authority::shared q<http://www.perlrdf.org/>;
 .
 And users can check they have a module released by the official team
 using:
 .
        RDF::TakeOverTheWorld->AUTHORITY(q<http://www.perlrdf.org/>);
 .
 which will croak if package RDF::TakeOverTheWorld doesn't have the
 specified authority.

Description: module providing automatic methods for core functions
 This module provides automatic methods which wrap perl's built-in
 functions for minipulating numbers, strings, arrays, hashes, and code
 references. It can be handy to use built-in functions as methods to avoid
 messy dereferencing syntaxes and parentheses pile ups.
 .
 autobox::Core is what you'd call a stub module. It is merely glue, presenting
 existing functions with a new interface. Most of the methods read like sub
 hex ($) { hex($_[0]) }. Besides built-ins that operate on hashes, arrays,
 scalars, and code references, some Perl 6-ish things were thrown in, and some
 keywords like foreach have been turned into methods.

Description: Perl pragma for method calls on native types
 autobox is a Perl pragma that enables method calls on Perl's native data types
 including numeric values (integers and floats), strings, arrays, hashes and
 even code references in a simple and consistent way.
 .
 When a method is invoked on something which is not a blessed object reference,
 autobox looks for the method in a package whose name corresponds to the ref()
 type of the value. This design means extending the default functionality for
 new methods on a type-by-type basis is very simple.

Description: Perl pragma to make certain failures fatal
 autodie is a Perl pragma that changes the behaviour of many built-in functions
 so that exceptions are thrown on failure rather than simply returning a false
 value. It understands lexical scope, meaning functions and subroutines altered
 with this module will only have this behaviour until the end of the enclosing
 eval, file or block, so it is useful when some code is out of your control.
 .
 By throwing exceptions on failure rather than simply returning false, programs
 are more robust and problems are easier to troubleshoot.
 .
 This module can also use IPC::System::Simple (see libipc-system-simple-perl)
 to do all the heavy lifting.

Description: Ada Web Server utilities
 AWS is a complete framework to develop Web based applications. The
 main part of the framework is the embedded Web server. This small yet
 powerful Web server can be embedded into your application so your
 application will be able to talk with a Web browser. Around this Web
 server a lot of services have been developed.
 .
 This package contains utility programs to help develop web applications
 with AWS:
 .
 awsres transforms any text or binary file into an Ada unit which you
 can compile into your application, thereby making your application
 completely independent of any external files (think: embedded)
 .
 ada2wsdl, an ASIS program, reads Ada unit specifications and creates
 descriptions in the Web Service Description Language, so that you can
 advertise your web service application to the world.
 .
 wsdl2aws does the opposite job: it creates an Ada unit (spec and
 skeleton body) conforming to a specified description in WSDL.

    access.
  - A session server, this is a very important module to be able to
    keep client's data from page to page.
  - Support SOAP to develop Web Services.
  - A tool to generate Web Services stubs/skeletons from a WSDL
    document.
  - A template parser, this module makes it possible to completely
    separate the Web design from the code. No more scripting into your Web
    page.
  - Support for Secure Sockets (HTTPS/SSL), this is based on the GNU TLS
    library.
  - Support for large servers using dispatchers based on URI, request
    methods.
  - Support for virtual hosting (dispatchers based on the host name).
  - Support for server push.
  - A directory browser ready to be used in any application.
  - A status page to get many information about the current AWS server.
  - A log module. Log files keep information about all resources
    requested to the server.
  - Hotplug modules which can be loaded/unloaded dynamically to add
    specific features to a server.
  - A communication API to exchange data between applications using the
    HTTP protocol.
  - A configuration API to tune/change the server parameters without
    recompilation.
  - A client API to retrieve any Web page from a Web site.
  - A Web Page service to build a simple static page server.
  - Support for SMTP, LDAP and Jabber protocols.

Description: Apache AXIOM - StAX-based XML Infoset compliant object model
 Apache Axiom provides an XML Infoset compliant object model implementation
 which supports on-demand building of the object tree. It supports a novel
 "pull-through" model which allows one to turn off the tree building and
 directly access the underlying pull event stream using the StAX API.
 It also has built in support for XML Optimized Packaging (XOP) and MTOM,
 the combination of which allows XML to carry binary data efficiently and
 in a transparent manner. The combination of these is an easy to use API
 with a very high performant architecture.

Description: SOAP implementation in Java
 Apache AXIS is an implementation of the SOAP ("Simple Object Access Protocol")
 submission to W3C.
 .
 From the draft W3C specification:
 .
 SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized,
 distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that consists of three
 parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message
 and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of
 application-defined datatypes, and a convention for representing remote
 procedure calls and responses.
 .
 This project is a follow-on to the Apache SOAP project.

Description: Apache web services engine - Misc. binaries
 Apache Axis2/C is a Web services engine implemented in the C
 programming language. It is based on the extensible and flexible
 Axis2 architecture. Apache Axis2/C can be used to provide and
 consume WebServices. It has been implemented with portability
 and ability to embed in mind, hence could be used as a Web services
 enabler in other software.
 .
 Apache Axis2/C supports SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2, as well as REST style
 of Webservices. A single service could be exposed both as a SOAP style as well
 as a REST style service simultaneously. It also has built in MTOM support,
 that can be used to exchange binary data.
 .
 Apache Axis2/C is efficient, modular and is designed with extensibility. The
 extensible design allows it to support the full WS-* stack with the
 concept of modules. Apache Axis2/C is the Web services engine that supports
 the most number of WS-* specification implementations in C, with
 guaranteed interoperability. This enables using C in Service Oriented
 Architecture (SOA) implementations, and would be very useful when integrating
 legacy systems into SOA.

Description: module to allow annotation and delegation of hooked OPs
 B::Hooks::OP::Annotation provides a way for XS code that hijacks OP op_ppaddr
 functions to delegate to (or restore) the previous functions, whether they
 are assigned by perl or by another module. Typically this should be used in
 conjunction with B::Hooks::OP::Check (see libb-hooks-op-check-perl).
 .
 B::Hooks::OP::Annotation makes its types and functions available to XS code
 by means of ExtUtils::Depends (libextutils-depends-perl). Modules that wish
 to use these exports in their XS code should use B::OP::Hooks::Annotation in
 the Perl module that loads the XS.

Description: Perl library to generate CODE 128 bar codes
 Barcode::Code128 generates bar codes using the CODE 128 symbology. It can
 generate images in PNG or GIF format using the GD package, or it can generate
 a text string representing the barcode that you can render using some other
 technology if desired.
 .
 The intended use of this module is to create a web page with a bar code on it,
 which can then be printed out and faxed or mailed to someone who will scan the
 bar code. The application which spurred its creation was an expense report
 tool, where the employee submitting the report would print out the web page
 and staple the receipts to it, and the Accounts Payable clerk would scan the
 bar code to indicate that the receipts were received.
 .
 The default settings for this module produce a large image that can safely be
 FAXed several times and still scanned easily. If this requirement is not
 important you can generate smaller image using optional parameters, described
 below.

Description: GDAL add-on tools to perform useful raster processing - libbase
 Pktools is a collection of programs to perform operations, mostly on
 raster geolocated  images. It  heavily relies  on the  Geospatial Data
 Abstraction Library (GDAL) and OGR.  The programs are similar to the
 GDAL tools (gdalinfo, gdal_translate,  gdal_merge, ...) and some of the
 functionalities provided in pktools already exist in the GDAL tools.
 .
 All utilities in pktools use command line options and have a built
 in help, and include more than thirty binaries to edit, change, crop,
 classify, compare, dump, fill, enhance images and many other
 common operations useful in the remote sensing field of image
 analysis.
 .

Description: Analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files
 The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a convenient
 possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary) Java class files
 (those ending with .class). Classes are represented by objects which contain
 all the symbolic information of the given class: methods, fields and byte
 code instructions, in particular.
 .
 Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a program
 (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. An even more
 interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch at run-time.
 The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful if you want to
 learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class
 files.

 .
 Belle-Sip supports multiple transports at the same time, has a dual
 IPv6 and IPv4 stack, is fully asynchronous and implements the
 +sip.instance and alias parameters. It also handles network
 disconnections better, offers a privacy API and supports rich presence.
 .
 SIP/TLS is handled by the lightweight polarssl library (as opposed to
 openssl).

Description: Perl module that displays progress bar during benchmarking
 Benchmark::ProgressBar is a combination of Benchmark and Term::ProgressBar
 that produces a simple progress bar illustrating execution of benchmark
 runs. As such, it is particularly useful for heavy benchmarking tests
 that take a long time to complete.
 .
 You can use it as a drop-in replacement for Benchmark, but the only functions
 that would display a progress bar are: cmpthese, timethese and timeit.
 .
 This module is not compatible for use with Benchmark in the same script. The
 author doesn't know of any case where this would make sense.

 portions of your code than the Benchmark module will give you, but don't want
 to go all out and profile your code.

 Best.pm attempts to load Perl modules from a list, stopping at the first

 Often there are several possible providers of some functionality your program
 needs, but you don't know which is available at the run site. For example,
 one of the modules may be implemented with XS, or not in the core Perl
 distribution and thus not necessarily installed. With Best.pm, this can
 be as simple as:
 .
  use Best qw/YAML::Syck YAML/;

Description: Perl module to format bibliographic references using Endnote-like templates
 Biblio::EndnoteStyle provides a way of formatting bibliographic
 references using style templates similar to those used by the popular
 reference management software Endnote (http://www.endnote.com/).  The
 API is embarrassingly simple: a formatter object is made using the
 class's constructor, the new() method; format() may then be
 repeatedly called on this object, using the same or different
 templates.
 .
 (The sole purpose of the object is to cache compiled templates so that
 multiple format() invocations are more efficient than they would
 otherwise be. Apart from that, the API might just as well have been a
 single function.)

Description: Perl module which reads ISIS databases
 This module will read ISIS databases created by DOS CDS/ISIS, WinIsis or
 IsisMarc.
 .
 Biblio::Isis is a Perl module which reads ISIS databases produced by
 CDS/ISIS programs, such as MicroISIS, WinISIS and IsisMARC. ISIS was a
 popular family of integrated library systems provided as freeware by
 UNESCO, and this module provides methods to parse full databases and
 use them in a Perl program in order to migrate them to other formats.
 .
 It can create hash values from data in ISIS database (using to_hash),
 ASCII dump (using to_ascii) or just hash with field names and packed
 values (like ^asomething^belse).
 .
 Unique feature of this module is ability to include_deleted records.
 It will also skip zero sized fields (OpenIsis has a bug in XS bindings, so
 fields which are zero sized will be filled with random junk from memory).
 .
 It also has support for identifiers (only if ISIS database is created by
 IsisMarc), see to_hash.

Description: Perl extension for managing ISO thesaurus
 A Thesaurus is a classification structure. It can be seen as a graph where
 nodes are terms and the vertices are relations between terms.
 .
 Biblio::Thesaurus provides transparent methods to maintain Thesaurus files.
 The module uses a subset from ISO 2788 which defines some standard features
 to be found on thesaurus files. This ISO includes a set of relations that can
 be seen as standard but, this program can use user defined ones. So, it can
 be used on ISO or not ISO thesaurus files.

 of the directives, it doesn't need to be kept updated as new directives are
 added, it simply knows how to carve up a BIND configuration file into logical

Description: parser for NCBI Entrez Gene and NCBI Sequence records
 Bio::ASN1::EntrezGene and Bio::ASN1::Sequence are regular expression-based
 parsers for NCBI Entrez Gene genome databases
 (<http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene>).
 .
 They parse ASN.1-formatted Entrez Gene records and NCBI sequences,
 returning data structures that contain all data items from the gene records
 or the sequence records.
 .
 The parser will report error & line number if input data does not conform to
 the NCBI Entrez Gene genome or NCBI Sequence annotation file format.
 .
 Bio::ASN1::Sequence is basically a modified version of the high-performance
 Bio::ASN1::EntrezGene parser. However this standalone module exists since it
 is more efficient to keep Sequence-specific code out of EntrezGene.pm.

Description: Perl interface to SamTools library for DNA sequencing
 Bio::SamTools provides a Perl interface to the libbam library for indexed and
 unindexed SAM/BAM sequence alignment databases. It provides support for
 retrieving information on individual alignments, read pairs, and alignment
 coverage information across large regions. It also provides callback
 functionality for calling SNPs and performing other base-by-base functions.
 Most operations are compatible with the BioPerl Bio::SeqFeatureI interface,
 allowing BAM files to be used as a backend to the GBrowse genome browser
 application.

Description: Bioinformatics framework for GNUstep and Cocoa (development files)
 BioCocoa is an open source Cocoa framework for bioinformatics. It intends to
 provide Cocoa programmers with a full suite of tools for handling and
 manipulating biological sequences. Cocoa is a great framework for rapid
 application development and it is therefore often used to create innovative
 bioscientific apps. To speed up development even more, BioCocoa wants to
 offer reusable Cocoa classes that are specific for molecular biology and
 biofinformatics. At this time, BioCocoa offers model classes for biological
 sequences, controller classes for alignment, sequence manipulation and I/O,
 interfacing with ENTREZ and view classes that let you easily display and work
 with sequences in your own applications.
 .
 This package contains the development files, documentation and
 examples for developing GNUstep applications using the BioCocoa framework.

Description: header files and docs for libbitmask
 Contains the header files and documentation for libbitmask
 for use in developing applications that use the libbitmask library.
 .
 This Bitmask library supports multi-word bitmask operations for
 applications programmed in 'C'. It works in conjunction with recent
 Linux kernel support for processor and memory placement on
 multiprocessor SMP and NUMA systems. The cpuset library, being
 developed in parallel, depends on this bitmask library.
 .
 Bitmasks provide multi-word bit masks and operations thereon to do
 such things as set and clear bits, intersect and union masks,
 query bits, and display and parse masks.
 .
 The initial intended use for these bitmasks is to represent sets of
 CPUs and Memory Nodes, when configuring large SMP and NUMA systems.
 However there is little in the semantics of bitmasks that is
 specific to this particular use, and bitmasks should be usable for
 other purposes that had similar design requirements.
 .
 These bitmasks share the same underlying layout as the bitmasks
 used by the Linux kernel to represent sets of CPUs and Memory
 Nodes. Unlike the kernel bitmasks, these bitmasks use dynamically
 allocated memory and are manipulated via a pointer. This enables a
 program to work correctly on systems with various numbers of CPUs
 and Nodes, without recompilation.
 .
 There is a related cpuset library which uses the bitmask type
 provided here to represent sets of CPUs and Memory Nodes. The
 internal representation (as an array of unsigned longs, in little
 endian order) is directly compatible with the sched_setaffinity(2)
 and sched_getaffinity(2) system calls (added in Linux 2.6).

Description: Basic Linear Algebra Comm. Subprograms - Dev. files for MPI
 The BLACS project is an ongoing investigation whose purpose is to
 create a linear algebra oriented message passing interface that may be
 implemented efficiently and uniformly across a large range of
 distributed memory platforms.
 .
 You can choose between an implementation based on MPI or PVM. This package
 uses MPI. There are packages for the shared libraries, for the static
 libraries and the development files (this one), and for test programs.
 .
 Most users do not need to install this package directly because it is
 used as a high level driver for the communication in the ScaLAPACK packages.
 Therefore, it is installed when installing ScaLAPACK. ScaLAPACK is a
 parallel version of LAPACK and is used on Beowulf type clusters.

 dynamically linked -- one can explicitly select a library to test by setting
 the libblas.so.3 alternative, or by using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD
 environment variables. Likewise, one can display the library selected using
 the ldd program in an identical environment.

Description: high performance meta-compressor optimized for binary data (development files)
 Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data. It has been
 designed to transmit data to the processor cache faster than the traditional,
 non-compressed, direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call. Blosc is
 meant not only to reduce the size of large datasets on-disk or in-memory, but
 also to accelerate memory-bound computations.
 .
 It uses the blocking technique to reduce activity on the memory bus as much
 as possible. In short, this technique works by dividing datasets in blocks
 that are small enough to fit in caches of modern processors and perform
 compression / decompression there. It also leverages, if available, SIMD
 instructions (SSE2) and multi-threading capabilities of CPUs, in order to
 accelerate the compression / decompression process to a maximum.
 .
 This package contains the development files required to build programs against
 Blosc.

Description: Boilerplate removal and fulltext extraction from HTML pages
 The boilerpipe library provides algorithms to detect and remove the surplus
 "clutter" (boilerplate, templates) around the main textual content of a web
 page.
 .
 The library already provides specific strategies for common tasks (for example:
 news article extraction) and may also be easily extended for individual problem
 settings.
 .
 Extracting content is very fast (milliseconds), just needs the input document
 (no global or site-level information required) and is usually quite accurate.

Description: Messages related to Robot OS bond_core - development
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). This is the 'bond' process state
 machine library development files.
 .
 Bond is a mechanism for checking when another process has
 terminated. A bond allows two processes, A and B, to know when the
 other has terminated, either cleanly or by crashing. The bond remains
 connected until it is either broken explicitly or until a heartbeat
 times out.

Description: Boost C++ Libraries development files (ALL) (default version)
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 This metapackage provides the complete Boost development environment,
 including all separately-packaged libraries.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.62).

Description: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.62).

 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic duration
    class.Examples of time durations include days, minutes, seconds and
    nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number of clock
    ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are united with
    a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
    represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
    epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a particular
    platform: system_clock, steady_clock and high_resolution_clock. A
    clock is a pairing of a time_point and duration, and a function
    which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
    current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time spent by the current
    process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures system-CPU time spent by the
    current process.
  * a tuple-like class process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU,
    and system-CPU process times together.
  * a thread_clock thread steady clock giving the time spent by the
    current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all
 registers and CPU flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t
 instance represents a specific point in the application's execution
 path. This is useful for building higher-level abstractions, like
 coroutines, cooperative threads (userland threads) or an equivalent
 to C# keyword yield in C++.

 Boost.Coroutine provides templates for generalized subroutines which
 allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at
 certain locations. It preserves the local state of execution and
 allows re-entering subroutines more than once (useful if state must
 be kept across function calls).

 Coroutines can be viewed as a language-level construct providing a
 special kind of control flow.

 Coroutines can be viewed as a language-level construct providing a
 special kind of control flow.
 .
 In contrast to threads, which are pre-emptive, coroutine switches are
 cooperative (programmer controls when a switch will happen). The
 kernel is not involved in the coroutine switches.
 .
 The implementation uses Boost.Context for context switching.

Description: cooperatively-scheduled micro-/userland-threads (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Fiber provides a framework for micro-/userland-threads (fibers)
 scheduled cooperatively.  The API contains classes and functions to
 manage and synchronize fibers similarly to standard thread support
 library.
 .
 Each fiber has its own stack.
 .
 A fiber can save the current execution state, including all registers
 and CPU flags, the instruction pointer, and the stack pointer and
 later restore this state. The idea is to have multiple execution
 paths running on a single thread using cooperative scheduling (versus
 threads, which are preemptively scheduled). The running fiber decides
 explicitly when it should yield to allow another fiber to run
 (context switching). Boost.Fiber internally uses execution_context
 from Boost.Context; the classes in this library manage, schedule and,
 when needed, synchronize those execution contexts. A context switch
 between threads usually costs thousands of CPU cycles on x86,
 compared to a fiber switch with less than a hundred cycles. A fiber
 runs on a single thread at any point in time.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.62).

 .
 Graphs are mathematical abstractions that are useful for solving
 many types of problems in computer science. Consequently, these
 abstractions must also be represented in computer programs. A
 standardized generic interface for traversing graphs is of utmost
 importance to encourage reuse of graph algorithms and data structures.

Description: generic graph components and algorithms in C++ (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Parallel Boost Graph Library is an extension to the Boost Graph Library
 (BGL) for parallel and distributed computing. It offers distributed graphs
 and graph algorithms to exploit coarse-grained parallelism along with
 parallel algorithms that exploit fine-grained parallelism, while retaining
 the same interfaces as the (sequential) BGL. Code written using the sequential
 BGL should be easy to parallelize with the parallel BGL.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.62).

Description: generic graph components and algorithms in C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Parallel Boost Graph Library is an extension to the Boost Graph Library
 (BGL) for parallel and distributed computing. It offers distributed graphs
 and graph algorithms to exploit coarse-grained parallelism along with
 parallel algorithms that exploit fine-grained parallelism, while retaining
 the same interfaces as the (sequential) BGL. Code written using the sequential
 BGL should be easy to parallelize with the parallel BGL.

Description: generic graph components and algorithms in C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Graphs are mathematical abstractions that are useful for solving
 many types of problems in computer science. Consequently, these
 abstractions must also be represented in computer programs. A
 standardized generic interface for traversing graphs is of utmost
 importance to encourage reuse of graph algorithms and data structures.

Description: C++ logging library (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 This library aims to make logging significantly easier for the
 application developer. It provides a wide range of out-of-the-box
 tools along with public interfaces for extending the library. The
 main goals of the library are:
 .
  * Simplicity. A small example code snippet should be enough to get
 the feel of the library and be ready to use its basic features.
  * Extensibility. A user should be able to extend functionality of the
 library for collecting and storing information into logs.
  * Performance. The library should have as little performance impact on
 the user's application as possible.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.62).

Description: C++ logging library
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 This library aims to make logging significantly easier for the
 application developer. It provides a wide range of out-of-the-box
 tools along with public interfaces for extending the library. The
 main goals of the library are:
 .
  * Simplicity. A small example code snippet should be enough to get
 the feel of the library and be ready to use its basic features.
  * Extensibility. A user should be able to extend functionality of the
 library for collecting and storing information into logs.
  * Performance. The library should have as little performance impact on
 the user's application as possible.

Description: Boost.Python Library development files (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.
 .
 This package also contains the pyste Boost.Python code generator that
 allows the user to specify classes and functions to be exported using
 a simple interface file, which following the Boost.Python's
 philosophy, is simple Python code.
 .
 This package allows development of a Python interface for all current
 versions of Python in Debian.  Code using this library will need also
 one of the Python development packages.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.62).

Description: regular expression library for C++ (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.62).

Description: serialization library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection,
 containing the following functionalities:
 .
  * proper restoration of pointers to shared data
  * serialization of STL containers and other commonly used templates
  * data portability - streams of bytes created on one platform should
    be readable on any other
  * archive interface must be rich enough to permit the creation of an
    archive that presents serialized data as XML in a useful manner
 .
 Here, "serialization" means the reversible deconstruction of an
 arbitrary set of C++ data structures to a sequence of bytes.
 archive: to refer to a specific rendering of this stream of bytes.

 Signals represent callbacks with multiple targets, and are also
 called publishers or events in similar systems. Signals are connected
 to some set of slots, which are callback receivers (also called event
 targets or subscribers), which are called when the signal is
 "emitted."

Description: managed signals and slots library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Signals represent callbacks with multiple targets, and are also
 called publishers or events in similar systems. Signals are connected
 to some set of slots, which are callback receivers (also called event
 targets or subscribers), which are called when the signal is
 "emitted."

Description: Operating system (e.g. diagnostics support) library (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost System library provides simple, light-weight error_code
 objects that encapsulate system-specific error code values, yet also
 provide access to more abstract and portable error conditions via
 error_condition objects. Because error_code objects can represent
 errors from sources other than the operating system, including
 user-defined sources, each error_code and error_condition has an
 associated error_category.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.62).

Description: Boost C++ Libraries development tools (default version)
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 This package provides the auxiliary tools bjam, Boost.Build, bcp,
 inspect, boostbook and quickbook.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.62).

Description: Boost C++ Libraries development tools
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 This package provides the auxiliary tools bjam, Boost.Build, bcp,
 inspect, boostbook and quickbook.

Description: Boost C++ Libraries development files (ALL)
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 This metapackage provides the complete Boost development environment,
 including all separately-packaged libraries.

Description: extended simple IRC bot for pluggable modules
 Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable started as Yet Another Infobot replacement,
 but now is a generalized framework for writing infobot-type bots that
 lets you keep each specific function separate. You can have separate modules
 for factoid tracking, 'seen' status, karma, googling, etc.
 Included default modules are:
 .
  Auth    - user authentication and main access.
  DNS     - host lookup (e.g. nslookup and dns).
  Google  - search Google for things.
  Infobot - handles infobot-style factoids.
  Join    - joins and leaves channels.
  Karma   - tracks the popularity of things.
  Loader  - loads and unloads modules as bot commands.
  Seen    - tells you when people were last seen.
  Title   - gets the title of URLs mentioned in channel.
  Vars    - changes module variables.

 Markov bots like Hailo and AI::MegaHAL are fun. But to get them
 working you either need to train them on existing training material or
 make your own.

Description: Perl module for hierarchical tag/value structures
 Boulder provides a simple stream-oriented format for transmitting data
 objects between one or more processes.  It does not provide for the
 serialization of Perl objects the way FreezeThaw or Data::Dumper do,
 but it does provide the advantage of being language independent.
 .
 In addition to a stream-oriented interface, Boulder comes with a
 simple record-oriented database-oriented interface, Boulder::Store,
 which provides query and search capabilities comparable to many flat
 file DBMS systems.

Description: Boxlib: C++ Block-structured finite difference algorithms library
 BoxLib is a foundation library of C++ classes that facilitate the development
 of block-structured finite difference algorithms such as arise in the solution
 of systems of partial differential equations. BoxLib is particularly useful
 in designing and building adaptive algorithms. BoxLib contains rich data
 structures for describing operations which take place on data defined in
 regions of index space that are unions of non-intersecting rectangles.
 Because we are interested in unsteady problems where the regions of interest
 may change in response to an evolving solution, support is provided in BoxLib
 for efficiently building and destroying the data structures.
 All constructs in BoxLib are designed to run efficiently in parallel.
 .
 BoxLib is the foundation library for the PMAMR (porous media) ,
 (low Mach number combustion), CASTRO (compressible astrophysics)
 codes. and NYX (cosmology) codes.  An analogous version of BoxLib written
 entirely in Fortran90 is the foundation library for the MAESTRO code,
 for example.

Description: 2D physics engine - development files
 2D rigid body simulation library for games. Programmers can use it in
 their games to make objects move in believable ways and make the world
 seem more interactive. From the game's point of view a physics engine is
 just a system for procedural animation. Rather than paying (or begging)
 an animator to move your actors around, you can let Sir Isaac Newton do
 the directing.

Description: 2D physics engine
 2D rigid body simulation library for games. Programmers can use it in
 their games to make objects move in believable ways and make the world
 seem more interactive. From the game's point of view a physics engine is
 just a system for procedural animation. Rather than paying (or begging)
 an animator to move your actors around, you can let Sir Isaac Newton do
 the directing.

Description: heterogeneous C library of numeric functions
 This library provides:
 .
   * a function for rounding floating point values to a specific number
     of digits
   * several pseudo-random number generators, including the Mersenne
     Twister, various algorithms by Marsaglia, and ISAAC
   * least common multiple and greatest common denominator functions
   * a few trigonometry functions for finding the inversions of hyperbolic
     sine, cosine, and tangent
 .
 This library is also used by libevocosm, which is in turn the
 foundation for Acovea, used to determine optimal compiler optimizations

 The core of BRiAl is a C++ library, which provides high-level data
 types for Boolean polynomials and monomials, exponent vectors, as
 well as for the underlying polynomial rings and subsets of the
 powerset of the Boolean variables. As a unique approach, binary
 decision diagrams are used as internal storage type for polynomial
 structures. On top of this C++-library a Python interface
 is provided. This allows parsing of complex polynomial systems, as well
 as sophisticated and extendable strategies for Groebner base
 computation. BRiAl features a powerful reference implementation
 for Groebner basis computation.

 A set of known commands per OS-name is tested for presence, and the first one
 found is executed. With an optional parameter, all known commands are
 checked.
 .
 The "open_browser" uses the system() function to execute the command. If you
 want more control, you can get the command with the "open_browser_cmd" or
 "open_browser_cmd_all" functions and then use whatever method you want to
 execute it.

Description: Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP library development files
 The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is designed to improve
 headphone listening of stereo audio records.
 .
 Typical stereo recordings are made for listening with speakers.
 What's missing in headphones is the sound going from each channel
 to the opposite ear, arriving a short time later for the extra distance
 traveled, and with a bit of high frequency roll-off for the shadowing
 effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be
 somewhat longer at low frequencies than at high frequencies. bs2b
 implements both of these ideas to transform stereophonic recordings
 for headphone listening.
 .
 This package contains the files needed to build packages linking against
 libbs2b.

 Exposed functions are: have_kintf (ability to push entropy back to
 the kernel); arc4random, arc4random_bytes, arc4random_uniform, the
 RANDOM variable (get entropy); arc4random_stir (next time used, some
 entropy from the kernel is first requested); arc4random_addrandom
 (add user data to SRNG state); arc4random_push[bk] (push user data
 to kernel RNG if supported; add kernel data or, if not supported,
 user data to SRNG); the ability to "tie" variables to this module
 for retrieving and storing entropy (e.g. in $RANDOM).

Description: Bean Scripting Framework to support scripting languages in Java
 Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
 scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
 objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs in
 languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. In
 addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or
 dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is
 achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines
 from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to
 these scripting language engines.
 .
 BSF supports these scripting languages:
  * Python (using Jython)
  * JavaScript (using rhino)
  * XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and Xerces)
  * BeanShell (using bsh) via its own bsf adapter
 .
 Support for Tcl, NetRexx is not available in this Debian

Description: permutation to block triangular form library for sparse matrices
 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
 sparse matrices.
 .
 The BTF library is a software package for permuting a matrix into Block upper
 Triangular Form. It includes a maximum transversal algorithm, which finds a
 permutation of a square or rectangular matrix so that it has a zero-free
 diagonal (if one exists); otherwise, it finds a maximal matching which
 maximizes the number of nonzeros on the diagonal. The package also includes a
 method for finding the strongly connected components of a graph. These two
 methods together give the permutation to block upper triangular form.

Description: Bitronix JTA Transaction Manager
 The Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM) is a simple but complete implementation
 of the JTA 1.0.1B API. It is a fully working XA transaction manager that
 provides all services required by the JTA API while trying to keep the code as
 simple as possible for easier understanding of the XA semantics. This is BTM's
 strongest point compared to its competitors: it is trivial to configure and
 when something goes wrong it is much easier to figure out what to do thanks to
 the great care placed in useful error reporting and logging.

Description: Perl module to validate or generate credit card checksums and names
 Business::CreditCard tell you whether a credit card number is
 self-consistent -- whether the last digit of the number is a valid
 checksum for the preceding digits.
 .
 The validate() subroutine returns 1 if the card number provided passes
 the checksum test, and 0 otherwise.
 .
 The cardtype() subroutine returns a string containing the type of
 card: "MasterCard", "VISA", and so on.
 .
 The generate_last_digit() subroutine computes and returns the last
 digit of the card given the preceding digits.  With a 16-digit card,
 you provide the first 15 digits; the subroutine returns the sixteenth.

 Business::ISBN::Data contains the data for Business::ISBN to do its work. It
 is current as per the version of this package.
 .
 You can update Business::ISBN::Data independently of this module as the
 various ISBN organizations assign new publisher codes. The ISBN agency lists
 these data on their website at http://www.isbn-international.org/, and a
 current RangeMessage.xml file can be downloaded from
 http://www.isbn-international.org/agency?rmxml=1 and will be used by this
 module in preference of the included data when pointed to by the
 ISBN_RANGE_MESSAGE environment variable.
 .
 Note, that as a historical artifact, some countries are actually language
 areas. For instance, country code 2 is "French", and includes several
 French-speaking countries.

Description: Java bytecode manipulation library
 The library presents itself as a collection of routines to manipulate Java
 bytecode. It allows for the dynamic creation of Java class files without
 using of Javac. Such tailored code can be used, i.e. as for the upstream's
 motivation of the BioJava developers, to generate implementations of
 Hidden Markov Models. It thus acts much like inline assembly for Java.

Description: Perl extension to generate cryptographically-secure random bytes
 Bytes::Random::Secure provides two interfaces for obtaining crypt-quality
 random bytes. The simple interface is built around plain functions. For
 greater control over the Random Number Generator's seeding, there is an
 Object Oriented interface that provides much more flexibility.
 .
 The "functions" interface provides five functions that can be used any time
 you need a string (or MIME Base64 representation, or hex-digits
 representation, or Quoted Printable representation) of a specific number of
 random bytes. There are equivalent methods available via the OO interface.
 .
 Bytes::Random::Secure can be a drop-in replacement for Bytes::Random, with
 the primary enhancement of using a much higher quality random number
 generator to create the random data. The random_bytes function emulates the
 user interface of Bytes::Random's function by the same name. But with
 Bytes::Random::Secure the random number generator comes from
 Math::Random::ISAAC, and is suitable for cryptographic purposes. The harder
 problem to solve is how to seed the generator. This module uses
 Crypt::Random::Seed to generate the initial seeds for Math::Random::ISAAC.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Perl module providing a mmap'ed cache
 Cache::FastMmap uses the mmap system call to establish an interprocess shared
 memory cache. Its core code is written in C, which can provide significant
 performance compared to a Pure Perl implementation such as Cache::Mmap. It can
 handle rather large pages without the socket connection and latency of using
 full-fledged databases where long-term persistence is unnecessary.
 .
 Since the algorithm uses a dual-level hashing system (a hash is used to find
 a page, then another hash within each page to find a given slot), most get
 calls can execute in constant O(1) time. The system uses fcntl to handle
 concurrent access, but only locks individual pages to reduce contention. The
 oldest (least recently used) data is evicted from the cache first, making
 this cache implementation most suitable for cases when old data is unlikely
 to be searched.

Description: simple data caching service with time history
 Cache::Historical provides simple methods to store and search text values
 that are tied to a time and a key, like user or category. Each caching
 operation sets a time stamp, thus making it possible to search according
 to events in time. Like the name suggests, it was originally conceived
 for recording of historic events such as stock trading.
 .
 This module uses SQLite3 as database backend, thus leaving ample space
 for costumized additional tools to the same cached historic data.

Description: cache interface to Memcached::libmemcached
 Cache::Memcached::libmemcached is the Cache::Memcached compatible interface to
 libmemcached, a C library to interface with memcached.
 .
 Cache::Memcached::libmemcached is built on top of Memcached::libmemcached.
 While Memcached::libmemcached aims to port libmemcached API to perl,
 Cache::Memcached::libmemcached attempts to be API compatible with
 Cache::Memcached, so it can be used as a drop-in replacement.
 .
 Cache::Memcached::libmemcached inherits from Memcached::libmemcached. While you
 are free to use the Memcached::libmemcached specific methods directly on the
 object, doing so will mean that your code is no longer compatible with the
 original Cache::Memcached API therefore losing some of the portability in case
 you want to replace it with some other package.

Description: API for managing cached information
 The Cache::Memcached::Managed module provides an API to values, cached in
 one or more memcached servers.  Apart from being very similar to the API
 of Cache::Memcached, the Cached::Memcached::Managed API allows for
 management of groups of values, for simplified key generation and expiration,
 as well as version and namespace management and a few other goodies.
 .
 Over the functionality provided by the Cache::Memcached module, this module
 provides: automatic key generation, ID refinement, version management,
 namespace support, group management, easy (default) expiration specification,
 automatic fork() detection, magical increment, instant invalidation,
 dead memcached server detection, starting/stopping memcached servers and an
 extensive test-suite.
 .
 The basic premise is that each piece of information that is to be cached,
 can be identified by a key, an optional ID, a version and a namespace.
 The key determines the basic identification of the value to be cached.
 The ID specifies a refinement on the basic identification.  The version
 ensures that differently formatted values with the same key and ID do not
 interfere with each other.  The namespace ensures that different realms
 of information (for instance, for different users) do not interfere with each
 other.

Description: module to provide a shared data cache using memory mapped files
 Cache::Mmap implements a shared data cache, using memory mapped files.
 If routines are provided which interact with the underlying data, access to
 the cache is completely transparent, and the module handles all the details of
 refreshing cache contents, and updating underlying data, if necessary.
 .
 Cache entries are assigned to "buckets" within the cache file, depending on
 the key. Within each bucket, entries are stored approximately in order of last
 access, so that frequently accessed entries will move to the head of the
 bucket, thus decreasing access time. Concurrent accesses to the same bucket are
 prevented by file locking of the relevant section of the cache file.
